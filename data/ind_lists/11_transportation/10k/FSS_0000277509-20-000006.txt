Business.

Federal Signal Corporation, founded in 1901, was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1969. The Company designs,  manufactures and supplies a suite of products and integrated solutions for municipal, governmental, industrial and commercial customers. The Company’s portfolio of products that it manufactures includes sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, vacuum- and hydro-excavation trucks (collectively, “safe-digging” trucks), street sweepers, road-marking and line-removal equipment, waterblasting equipment, dump truck bodies, trailers, and safety and security systems, including technology-based products and solutions for the public safety market. In addition, the Company engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive aftermarket offering to its customers. The Company operates 

15

 principal manufacturing facilities in 

five

 countries and provides products and integrated solutions to customers in all regions of the world.

Narrative Description of Business

Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered, by the Company are divided into two reportable segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. Corporate contains those items that are not included in the Company’s reportable segments.

Financial information concerning the Company’s two reportable segments for each of the three years in the period ended 

December
31, 2019

, is included in Note

17

 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding the Company’s discontinued operations is included in Note

19

 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference.

Environmental Solutions Group

The Company’s Environmental Solutions Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a full range of street sweepers, sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, safe-digging trucks, high-performance waterblasting equipment, dump truck bodies and trailers. The Group manufactures vehicles and equipment in the U.S. and Canada that are sold under the Elgin

brand names. Products are sold to both municipal and industrial customers either through a dealer network or direct sales to service customers generally depending on the type and geographic location of the customer. The acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. and Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc. (collectively, “JJE”) in 2016 extended the Environmental Solutions Group’s existing sales channel and increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. The acquisition of JJE also broadened the Environmental Solutions Group’s product offerings to include other products, such as refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment. In addition to vehicle and equipment sales, the Group also engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a complete offering to its current and potential customers through its service centers located across North America.

Under the Elgin brand name, the Company sells a leading U.S.
brand of street sweepers primarily designed for large-scale cleaning of curbed streets, parking lots and other paved surfaces utilizing mechanical sweeping, vacuum and recirculating air technology. Vactor is a leading manufacturer of equipment solutions for cleaning and maintaining sewers and catch basins. Under the TRUVAC brand name, introduced in 2019, the Company manufactures a range of premium vacuum- and hydro-excavation trucks designed to satisfy the safe-digging requirements of businesses or organizations that locate and verify underground utility lines and pipes. Guzzler is a leader in industrial vacuum loaders used to manage industrial waste or recover and recycle valuable raw materials. Westech is a manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum-excavation trucks. Jetstream manufactures high-pressure waterblasting equipment and accessories for commercial and industrial cleaning and maintenance operations. The Company manufactures and sells dump truck bodies and trailers under the Ox Bodies, Crysteel, J-Craft, Duraclass, Rugby and Travis brand names

.

In addition, as discussed in Note 

2

 – Acquisitions, on 

July
1, 2019

, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Mark Rite Lines Equipment Company, Inc. (“MRL”), a U.S. manufacturer of truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking and line-removal equipment, including its wholly-owned subsidiary HighMark Traffic Services, Inc. The Company expects that MRL will provide an efficient entry into a new line of product offerings and access to new markets, and enable it to strengthen the Environmental Solutions Group’s market position as a specialty vehicle manufacturer in maintenance and infrastructure end-markets, leveraging its expertise in building chassis-based vehicles.

Safety and Security Systems Group

The Company’s Safety and Security Systems Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of comprehensive systems and products that law enforcement, fire rescue, emergency medical services, campuses, military facilities and industrial sites use to protect people and property. Offerings include systems for community alerting, emergency vehicles, first responder interoperable communications and industrial communications.

and Victor

®

brand names. The Group operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and South Africa.

Marketing and Distribution

Depending primarily on the type and geographic location of the end-customer, the Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network, including JJE, or direct sales to serve customers. The 2017 acquisition of Truck Bodies and Equipment International (“TBEI”) increased the number of dealers within the Company’s network and also added additional direct sales resources. The dealer network serves both municipal and industrial end-markets. Within municipal markets, the majority of the Company’s dealers operate exclusively in their assigned territory. In conjunction with selling vehicles to end-customers, dealer representatives demonstrate vehicle functionality and capability and provide vehicle service. In addition to selling products manufactured by the Company, JJE distributes and re-sells products manufactured by other companies. The Company believes its regional, national and global dealer networks for vehicles is a distinguishing factor from its competitors. The Environmental Solutions Group’s direct sales channel concentrates primarily on the industrial, utility and construction market segments, and the service centers provide post-sale service, ancillary parts and equipment rentals. The acquisition of JJE increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. 

The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel or independent manufacturer representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and the direct sales force. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of the direct sales force and independent distributors. International sales are made through independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. 

Customers and Backlog

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in any year within the three-year period ended 

December
31, 2019

. Of the 

$1,269.0 million

 total orders reported in 

2019

, approximately 

34%

 were from U.S.
municipal and governmental customers, 

44%

 were from U.S.
commercial and industrial customers and 

22%

 were from non-U.S.
customers.

The Company’s backlog totaled 

$386.9 million

 at 

December
31, 2019

 compared to 

$337.7 million

 at 

December
31, 2018

. The increase of 

$49.2 million

, or 

15%

, was primarily due to continued strong demand for sewer cleaners and safe-digging trucks, as well as higher orders for road-marking and line-removal equipment and refuse trucks. Backlogs vary by group due to the nature of the Company’s products and the buying patterns of its customers. The Environmental Solutions Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately three to six months of shipments. The Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. Production of the Company’s 

December
31, 2019

 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 

2020

.

Suppliers

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of current purchases are from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply
disruptions.

Components critical to the production of the Company’s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel, as well as commercial chassis, from multiple sources. In addition, we may incorporate chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. As a distributor of equipment manufactured by other companies, JJE relies on the availability of equipment supplied by others to meet customer demand.

Table of Contents

While there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain raw materials and components that could impact price, quality and availability in sufficient quantities, the Company believes it has adequate supplies and sources of availability of the raw materials and components necessary to meet its needs.

Competition

Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor, TRUVAC and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S.
waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. JJE is a leading Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. TBEI includes a portfolio of regional brands with market leadership positions in distinct geographies and product categories, differentiating itself with its broad regional distribution network, focus on customer responsiveness and operational expertise. MRL is a market-leading manufacturer of road-marking and line-removal equipment.

Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the market leaders. The Group’s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of the Group’s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on price, features, reputation, performance and service, often within competitive bidding situations.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the “

Narrative Description of Business

” section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company’s business is dependent on our trademarks.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 

3,600

people in its businesses at 

December
31, 2019

, with the Company’s U.S. hourly workers accounting for approximately 

54%

 of its total workforce. Approximately 

15%

 of the Company’s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions at 

December
31, 2019

. The Company believes that its labor relations with its employees are good.

Governmental Regulation of the Environment

As part of its ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the Company endeavors to establish environmentally-friendly policies and objectives, and believes that these actions are also consistent with cost-effective operating practices. With the application of these policies, the Company believes it complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures in 

2019

 attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company also believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Seasonality

Certain of the Company’s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. In general, the Company tends to have lower equipment sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. In addition, rental income and parts sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because many of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities in North America, where usage is typically lower during periods of harsher weather conditions.

Risk Factors.

We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form
10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.

Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.

In 

2019

, we generated approximately 

78%

 of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.

We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.

Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 

2019

, approximately 

22%

 of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks associated with actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. 

To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. 

Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S.
dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S.
dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.

We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.

Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “

Risk Factors

” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.

The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.

Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.

We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.

Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to renew our leases upon their expiration. 

We lease from third parties approximately 

58%

 of the square footage of the facilities utilized in our operations, including with respect to certain of our manufacturing plants and our sales, service, warehousing and office locations. If we are unable to renew the existing leases on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to relocate the affected operations. Alternatively, we may decide to relocate operations. Relocation could result in material disruptions to our business (including potential changes to our workforce if the new location does not allow for our existing workforce to service it) and our incurrence of significant capital and other expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.

We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

We operate in highly competitive markets.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

We may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.

We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the 

7

Table of Contents

award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.

Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.

We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.

Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.

We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.

We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have been known to occur in certain of these international regions, resulting in public health crises. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. Increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.

Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.

Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.

Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.

We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products.
Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.
These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.  

Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.

As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of 

December
31, 2019

, approximately 

15%

 of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.

Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.

Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 

84%

 as of 

December
31, 2019

. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. 

The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.

We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those 

9

Table of Contents

products. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.

An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.

As of 

December
31, 2019

, goodwill and intangible assets represented 

33%

 and 

14%

 of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets as of 

December
31, 2019

. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded.

We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.

Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:

[TABLE]

•

integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

managing geographically dispersed operations;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience;
and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.

[/TABLE]

We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.

Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.

We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net sales (“adjusted EBITDA margin”) as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. We believe that investors use versions of these metrics in a similar manner. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin are meaningful metrics to investors in evaluating the Company’s underlying financial performance. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of income from continuing operations, interest expense, pension settlement charges, hearing loss settlement charges, debt settlement charges, acquisition and integration-related expenses, restructuring activity, executive severance costs, purchase accounting effects, other income/expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense divided by net sales for the applicable period(s). Other companies may use different methods to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard, which resulted in a change to the Company’s recognition of the deferred gain associated with historical sale lease-back transactions. Prior to 2019, the deferred gain, which initially totaled $29.0 million, was being recognized through the Consolidated Statement of Operations on a straight-line basis over the 15-year lease term. As a result, approximately $1.9 million of the deferred gain had been recognized each year since 2008. Effective in 2019, the Company no longer recognizes any portion of the gain through the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and recognized the remaining deferred gain balance, net of the related deferred tax asset, as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings. To facilitate comparisons with prior periods, the Company has revised its previously-issued adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to exclude the recognition of this deferred gain. The following table summarizes the Company’s consolidated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin and reconciles income from continuing operations to consolidated adjusted EBITDA for each of the five years in the period ended

, which did not repeat in 2018. In addition, during the year ended December
31, 2018, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $8.6 million associated with the completion of a tax planning strategy in Spain, which is expected to reduce cash tax payments in that jurisdiction over the next several years. Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was lower than in 2018, largely due to the recognition of a $23.0 million net tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. following the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate included in the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit was partially offset by a $2.2 million net increase in valuation allowance, inclusive of a $3.0 million valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the recognition of $0.6 million of additional tax expense associated with a change in the state tax rate in Illinois, and additional taxes resulting from higher pre-tax earnings.

31, 2018, compared with $60.5 million in 

the year ended December 31, 2017

, largely due to the improved operating income and the absence of $6.1 million in pension settlement charges incurred in 

the year ended December 31, 2017

, partially offset by the $17.4 million increase in income tax expense, the $2.0 million increase in interest expense and the $1.4 million reduction in other income. 

Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax

Year ended 

December
31, 2018

 vs. year ended 

December
31, 2017

Total orders increased by $139.5 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. U.S. orders increased by $131.7 million, largely due to the 

2017

 acquisition of TBEI, which contributed an increase in orders of $64.4 million in a full-year in 2018. The organic growth in the U.S. of $67.3 million was largely driven by improvements in orders for vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners of $49.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively.  In addition, aftermarket demand, representing orders for parts, service, used and rental equipment, improved by $9.3 million. Non-U.S. orders increased by $7.8 million, primarily due to improvements in orders for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners, street sweepers, and waterblasting equipment of $11.3 million, $6.8 million, $4.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket orders improved by $7.3 million. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $23.0 million decrease in refuse truck orders.

Net sales increased by $170.9 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. U.S. sales increased by $167.4 million, or 31%, primarily due to the inclusion of five more months of TBEI results in 2018, accounting for $97.0 million of the sales increase, as well as increases in shipments of vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners of $37.9 million and $28.8 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket revenues improved by $3.4 million, primarily represented by increased parts and service revenues and rental income. Non-U.S. sales increased by $3.5 million, or 2%, primarily due to a $12.4 million improvement in aftermarket revenue, represented by higher parts and service revenues, rental income and used equipment sales, as well as a $6.6 million increase in vacuum truck shipments. The acquisition of TBEI also contributed $1.1 million of incremental sales. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $16.1 million reduction in sales of products manufactured by other companies, such as refuse trucks.

Cost of sales increased by $117.1 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales volumes, the effects of a full year of TBEI activity in 2018 compared with seven months in 2017, higher material costs and a $3.7 million increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in purchase accounting expenses. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 22.9% from 20.8% in 

2017

, primarily due to improved operating leverage, benefits from pricing actions taken in response to higher commodity costs, favorable sales mix and the reduction in purchase accounting expenses, partially offset by the higher depreciation expense.

SEG&A expenses increased by $13.2 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to the addition of expenses associated with the TBEI acquisition, including an increase in amortization expense of $3.2 million. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses decreased from 10.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017, to 9.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018. 

Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $40.6 million, or 56%, largely due to a $53.8 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $13.2 million increase in SEG&A expenses.

Backlog was $310.3 million at December
31, 2018, up 34% compared to $231.1 million at December
31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to the effects of improved demand for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and street sweepers in the U.S.

Corporate Expense

Corporate operating expenses were 

$30.9 million

, 

$25.6 million

 and 

$25.8 million

 for the years ended 

December
31, 2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. 

For the year ended 

December
31, 2019

, corporate operating expenses increased by 

$5.3 million

, primarily driven by higher post-employment expenses, employee-related costs and information technology investments. In addition, acquisition-related expenses increased by 

$0.8 million

, primarily due to the acquisition of MRL.  

For the year ended December
31, 2018, corporate operating expenses decreased by $0.2 million, primarily driven by a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition and integration-related expenses, reductions in hearing loss litigation and post-employment expenses and the absence of $0.7 million in executive severance costs, partially offset by higher employee incentive and stock compensation costs. 

The Company’s hearing loss litigation has historically been managed by the Company’s legal staff resident at the corporate office and not by management at either segment. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, 

Segment Reporting

, which provides that segment reporting should follow the management of the item and that certain expenses may be corporate expenses, these legal expenses (which are not part of the normal operating activities of any of our reportable segments) are reported and managed as corporate expenses.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company uses its cash flow from operations to fund growth and to make capital investments that sustain its operations, reduce costs, or both. Beyond these uses, remaining cash is used to pay down debt, repurchase shares, fund dividend payments and make pension contributions. The Company may also choose to invest in the acquisition of businesses. In the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, we believe that the Company’s existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the 2019 Credit Agreement will provide funds sufficient for these purposes. The net cash flows associated with the Company’s rental equipment transactions are included in cash flow from operating activities. 

The Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled 

$31.6 million

, 

$37.4 million

 and 

$37.5 million

 as of 

December
31, 2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. As of 

December
31, 2019

, 

$13.8 million

 of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the U.S. typically are held in the currency of the country in which it is located. The Company uses this cash to fund the operating activities of its foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Generally, the Company has considered such cash to be permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund U.S. operations. However, in the event that these funds were needed to fund U.S. operations or to satisfy U.S. obligations, they generally could be repatriated. The repatriation of these funds may cause the Company to incur additional U.S. income tax expense, dependent on income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any such amounts were repatriated.

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled 

$103.4 million

, 

$92.8 million

 and 

$73.5 million

 in 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. The 

$10.6 million

, or 

11%

, increase in cash generated by continuing operating activities in 

2019

 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher earnings and a 

$7.0 million

 reduction in pension contributions. These improvements were partially offset by a 

$4.1 million

 increase in income tax payments, a 

$3.1 million

 increase in acquisition-

related activity, investments in working capital and rental fleet, as well as higher incentive compensation payments in comparison to the prior year.

Net cash used for continuing investing activities totaled 

$84.4 million

, 

$11.0 million

 and 

$277.1 million

 in 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. In each of the years presented, cash was used to fund the purchase of properties and equipment, with

, 

$14.1 million

 and 

$8.0 million

 of capital expenditures in 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 

2019

 was largely related to the expansion of the primary production facility of the Company’s Vactor Manufacturing, Inc. subsidiary. In addition, as discussed in Note 

2

 – Acquisitions, in 

2019

 the Company paid an initial 

$49.6 million

 to acquire MRL, net of cash acquired. In 

2018

, the Company received an adjustment for working capital and other post-closing items in the amount of 

$3.0 million

 relating to the TBEI acquisition, which was completed in 

2017

 for an initial payment of 

$269.2 million

. 

In 

2019

, net cash of 

$24.6 million

 was used for continuing financing activities, compared with 

$81.2 million

 in 

2018

. In 

2019

, the Company’s net borrowings under its revolving credit facility increased by 

$7.4 million

, primarily related to the funding of the acquisition of MRL. In addition, the Company funded payments of 

$10.3 million

 relating to acquisitions completed in 2016, paid cash dividends of 

$19.3 million

, incurred 

$1.0 million

 of debt refinancing costs, repurchased 

$1.0 million

 of treasury stock and redeemed 

$2.1 million

 of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees’ minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation. In 

2018

, the Company repaid 

$62.1 million

 of borrowings under its revolving credit facility, funded cash dividends of 

$18.7 million

 and repurchased 

$1.2 million

 of treasury stock. In 

2017

, in connection with the funding of the acquisition of TBEI, the Company borrowed 

$243.0 million

 against its revolving credit facility. Between the TBEI acquisition date and the end of 

2017

, approximately 

$34 million

 of net borrowings were repaid. In addition, the Company funded cash dividends of 

$16.8 million

 and redeemed 

$2.9 million

 of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees’ minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation. 

On 

July
30, 2019

, the Company entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement, by and among the Company (the “U.S. Borrower”) and certain of its foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the “Borrowers”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, and the other lenders and parties signatory thereto. 

The 2019 Credit Agreement is a 

$500 million

 revolving credit facility, maturing on 

July
30, 2024

, that provides for borrowings in the form of loans or letters of credit up to the aggregate availability under the facility, with a sub-limit of 

$75 million

 for letters of credit. The 2019 Credit Agreement allows for the Borrowers to borrow in denominations of U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros or British Pounds (with borrowings in non-U.S. currencies subject to a sublimit of 

$200 million

). In addition, the Company may cause the commitments to increase by up to an additional 

$250 million

, subject to the approval of the applicable lenders providing such additional financing.
Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

The Company’s material domestic subsidiaries provide guarantees for all obligations of the Borrowers under the 2019 Credit Agreement, which is secured by a first priority security interest in (i) all existing or hereafter acquired domestic property and assets of the U.S. Borrower and material domestic subsidiaries, (ii) the stock or other equity interests in each of the material domestic subsidiaries and (iii) 

65%

 of outstanding voting capital stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions.

Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 

zero

 to 

0.75%

 for base rate borrowings and 

1.00%

 to 

1.75%

 for LIBOR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between 

0.10%

 to 

0.25%

per annum on the unused portion of the 

$500 million

 revolving credit facility along with other standard fees. Letter of credit fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable LIBOR margin plus other customary fees.

The Company is subject to certain net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement that are to be measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of 

December
31, 2019

. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes a series of “covenant holiday” periods, which allow for the temporary increase of the minimum net leverage ratio following the completion of a permitted acquisition, or a series of acquisitions, when the aggregate consideration over a period of twelve months exceeds 

$75 million

. In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets; (ii) make certain fundamental business changes, such as mergers, consolidations or any similar combination; (iii) make restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases; (iv) incur indebtedness; (v) make certain loans and investments; (vi) create liens; 

26

Table of Contents

(vii) transact with affiliates; (viii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions; (ix) make negative pledges; and (x) modify subordinated debt documents.

Under the 2019 Credit Agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, shall be permitted if (i) the Company’s leverage ratio is less than or equal to 

3.25

; (ii) the Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants; and (iii) there are no existing defaults under the 2019 Credit Agreement. If its leverage ratio is more than 

3.25

, the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to 

$35 million

 of dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (ii) an incremental 

$50 million

 of other cash payments.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement and the commitments from the lenders may be terminated.

The 2019 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, which provided the Company with a 

$400 million

 revolving credit facility.

In connection with the execution of the 2019 Credit Agreement during 

the year ended December 31, 2019

, the Company incurred 

$1.0 million

 of debt issuance costs. Such fees have been deferred and are being amortized over the 

five

-year term. 

As of 

December
31, 2019

, there was 

$219.9 million

 of cash drawn and 

$11.2 million

 of undrawn letters of credit under the 2019 Credit Agreement, with 

$268.9 million

 of net availability for borrowings.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 

October 31, 2019

.

In testing the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative or quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, 

Intangibles
–
Goodwill and Other

.

A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In this situation, the Company would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below.

A quantitative approach is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and no impairment charge is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, this difference is recorded as an impairment charge not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using both the income and market approaches.

Under the income approach, the key assumptions include projected sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. These assumptions are determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan, including growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions. An additional key assumption under this approach is the discount rate, which is determined by reviewing current risk-free rates of capital and current market interest rates and by evaluating the risk premium relevant to the reporting unit. If the Company’s assumptions relative to growth rates were to change, the fair value calculation may change, which could result in impairment.

Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value using marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Similar to the income approach discussed above, sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and their respective growth rates are key assumptions utilized. The market prices of the Company’s common stock and other guideline companies are additional key inputs. If these market prices increase, the estimated market value would increase. Conversely, if market prices decrease, the estimated market value would decrease.

The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management’s evaluation of the relevance of the two approaches. 

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from estimated financial results due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company also compares the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the overall fair value of the Company implied by its market capitalization. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. 

Management applied the quantitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 

2019

 and used a combination of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units. The valuation was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist. One measure of the sensitivity of assumptions used in the impairment analysis is the amount by which each reporting unit “passed” (fair value exceeds the carrying value). The fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 

20%

, and, therefore, 

no

 impairment was recognized in 

2019

. 

Management applied the qualitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 

2018

 and 

2017

 and concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were less than their carrying values. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

An intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets include trade names associated primarily with the MRL, TBEI, and JJE acquisitions that were completed in 

2019

, 

2017

, and 

2016

, respectively. 

In testing the indefinite-lived intangibles assets for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative test, or a quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, 

Intangibles 

— 

Goodwill and Other

.  A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying value. A quantitative impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value. 

Significant judgment is applied when evaluating whether an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life and in testing for impairment. The Company primarily uses the relief from royalty model to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. The relief from royalty model requires management to make a number of business and valuation assumptions including future revenue growth and royalty rates. 

In 

2019

, the Company performed a combination of qualitative and quantitative impairment tests over its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets that were quantitatively tested for impairment significantly exceeded their carrying value, and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. This valuation was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist. Further, the Company concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that were qualitatively tested for impairment were less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed.

The Company applied the qualitative approach to assess its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in

 and

The Company had no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments in 

2019

, 

2018

 or 

2017

. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from estimated financial results due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the Company’s results of operations. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally this occurs at a point in time, with the transfer of control of the Company’s products or services to customers. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped; however, occasionally control passes later or earlier than shipment due to customer contract or letter of credit terms. 

In circumstances where credit is extended, payment terms generally range from 30 to 120 days and customer deposits may be required.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring products or providing services. Expected returns and allowances are estimated and recognized based primarily on an analysis of historical experience, with 

Net sales

 presented net of such returns and allowances.  

The Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. These arrangements may include software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products’ essential functionality. The Company identifies all performance obligations that are to be delivered separately under the sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company 

30

Table of Contents

uses an observable price to determine the standalone selling price or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. In general, performance obligations include hardware, integration and installation services. The allocated revenue for each performance obligation is recognized as such performance obligations are satisfied.

Net sales

 include sales of products and billed freight related to product sales. Freight has not historically comprised a material component of 

Net sales

. The Company has elected to account for such shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis and are excluded from 

Net sales

.

Income Taxes

We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. 

Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income. If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.

We continually evaluate the need to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent that, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets. 

During the year ended 

December
31, 2019

, the Company determined that 

$0.8 million

 of valuation allowance, previously recorded against state deferred tax assets, could be released primarily as a result of an increase to future taxable income expected to be generated in certain states. At 

December
31, 2019

, the total valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets was 

$8.2 million

, comprised of a 

$4.2 million

 valuation allowance recorded against state net operating loss carryforwards, a 

$0.9 million

 valuation allowance recorded against foreign net deferred tax assets, and a 

$3.1 million

 valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To mitigate this risk, the Company may utilize derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and is not party to leveraged derivatives contracts.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company has certain debt instruments which subject it to market risk associated with movements in interest rates. The fair value of the Company’s total debt obligations held at 

December
31, 2019

 was 

$220.5 million

. From time to time, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps as a means of fixing the floating interest rate component on its variable-rate debt. At 

December
31, 2019

, the Company had one interest rate swap outstanding. That swap had a notional amount of 

$75.0 million

, and fixed the floating interest rate component on 

$75.0 million

 of the Company’s variable-rate debt. See Note

9

 – Debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company’s debt agreements and interest rate swaps that were in place during 

2019

. A hypothetical 1% increase or decrease in variable interest rates on the Company’s total debt obligations as of 

December
31, 2019

 would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $1.5 million.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s sales, expenses and cash flow are transacted in U.S.
dollars, the Company has exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Canadian Dollar, Euro and British pound. The impact of currency movements on the Company’s financial results is largely mitigated by natural hedges in its operations. The Canadian operations of JJE primarily conduct business in Canadian dollars. Almost all other sales of product from the U.S. to other parts of the world are denominated in U.S. dollars. Sales from and within other currency zones are predominantly transacted in the currency of the country sourcing the product or service. Approximately 

78%

 of the Company’s net sales are conducted within the U.S. and are transacted in U.S.
dollars. Management estimates that a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would reduce full-year net sales by approximately 2% and operating income by approximately 1%.

The Company may also have foreign currency exposures related to buying and selling in currencies other than the local currency in which it operates and to certain balance sheet positions. If such transactional or balance sheet exposures are material, the Company may enter into matching foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to protect against variability in exchange rates.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Critical Audit Matter Description 

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit by utilizing a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach requires management to make a number of business and valuation assumptions for each reporting unit including annual assumptions of projected sales, cost of sales and operating expenses, and discount rates. The market approach requires management to estimate fair value using data which is selected from a 

34

Table of Contents

comparable industry group of publicly traded companies. The Company’s goodwill balance was 

$388.8 million

 as of 

December
31, 2019

. 

No impairment was recognized in 

2019

. 

We identified the valuation of goodwill for one of the Company’s reporting units as a critical audit matter due to 

the sensitivity of the business to changes in the United States economy, the reporting unit’s historical performance as compared to projections, and the difference between its fair value and the carrying value. Auditing management’s judgments regarding projected sales, cost of sales and operating expenses, as well as selection of the discount rate and selection of multiples applied to management’s projected revenues and EBITDA estimates (“market multiples”) for this reporting unit required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 

Our audit procedures related to the projected sales, cost of sales and operating expenses (“forecasts”), and the selection of the discount rate and selection of market multiples applied to management’s projected revenues and EBITDA estimates for this reporting unit included the following, among others: 

[TABLE]

•

We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the forecasts, the selection of the discount rates, and the market multiples.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Federal Signal Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of 

December
31, 2019

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 

December
31, 2019

, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO. 

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the financial statements, as of and for the year ended 

December
31, 2019

, of the Company and our report dated 

February
27, 2020

 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of ASU 

No. 2016-02

, Leases (“Topic 842”)

 and ASU No. 2018-11, 

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

. 

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded the internal controls over financial reporting of Mark Rite Lines Equipment Company, Inc. (“MRL”) from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of 

December
31, 2019

. MRL was acquired on 

July
1, 2019

 and its net sales and total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets, which were integrated into the Company’s control environment) represent approximately

3%

and 

2%

, respectively, of the financial statement amounts as of, and for the year ended, 

December
31, 2019

. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at MRL.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB

.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Description of the Business

Federal Signal Corporation was founded in 1901 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1969. References herein to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer collectively to Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Products manufactured and services rendered by the Company are divided into 

two

reportable segments: Environmental Solutions Group and Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. 

The Company’s fiscal year ends on December 31. All references to 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

 relate to the fiscal year unless otherwise indicated.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of Federal Signal Corporation and its subsidiaries and have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

As discussed in Note

 – Acquisitions, on 

July
1, 2019

, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Mark Rite Lines Equipment Company, Inc. (“MRL”), a U.S. manufacturer of truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking and line-removal equipment, including its wholly-owned subsidiary HighMark Traffic Services, Inc. The Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

December
31, 2019

 includes fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition, whereas the Consolidated Statements of Operations 

for the year ended December 31, 2019

 include the post-acquisition operating results of MRL.

Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2019

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, 

Leases

 (“Topic 842”), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 840, Leases (“Topic 840”). Topic 842 requires organizations that are lessees in operating lease arrangements to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosure of key qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements by both lessors and lessees. The Company adopted Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019, using the alternative transition method outlined in ASU No. 2018-11, 

Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements

, which permits application of the new guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption, with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. See Note 

4

 – Leases for further discussion.

Non-U.S. Operations

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, other than those whose functional currency is the U.S.
dollar, are translated at current exchange rates with the related translation adjustments reported in stockholders’ equity as a component of 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

. Accounts within the Consolidated Statements of Operations are translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical exchange rates. 

The Company incurs foreign currency transaction gains or losses, related to transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of 

Other expense (income), net

. For the years ended 

December

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments.

Accounts Receivable

The Company carries accounts receivable at the face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses as a result of a customer’s inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time outstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivables that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.

Inventories

The Company’s inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Included in the cost of inventories are raw materials, direct wages and associated production costs.

Properties and Equipment

Properties and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives generally range from 

eight

 to 

40
 years

for buildings and 

three

 to 

15
 years

for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated 

over the shorter of the remaining life of the lease or the useful life of the improvement

. Depreciation expense is primarily included as a component of 

Cost of sales

 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with depreciation expense associated with certain assets used for administrative purposes being presented within Selling, engineering, general and administrative (“SEG&A”) expenses. Depreciation expense, which includes depreciation on rental equipment, was 

$
32.7
 million

, 

$
28.4
 million

and 

$
25.2
 million

in the 

years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

, respectively.

Properties and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

Rental Equipment

The Company enters into lease agreements with customers related to the rental of certain equipment. All of these leasing agreements are classified as operating leases and are for periods generally not to exceed 

five years

. In accounting for these leases, the cost of the equipment purchased or manufactured by the Company is recorded as an asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life. Rental income is recognized ratably over the term of the underlying leases.

Rental equipment is depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and is reviewed for potential impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares non-discounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on a non-discounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

Rental equipment includes certain equipment that is manufactured by the Company and subsequently transferred to the rental fleet, as well as equipment purchased from third-party manufacturers, for the purpose of renting to end-customers. The related cash flow activity associated with these transactions is reflected within operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of 

October 31, 2019

.

In testing the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative or quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, 

Intangibles
–
Goodwill and Other

.

A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In this situation, the Company would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below.

A quantitative approach is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and no impairment charge is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, this difference is recorded as an impairment charge not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using both the income and market approaches.

Under the income approach, the key assumptions include projected sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and the discount rate. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value using marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management’s evaluation of the relevance of the two approaches. 

Management applied the quantitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 

2019

 and used a combination of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units. The fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 

20
%

, and, therefore, 

no

impairment was recognized in 

2019

. 

Management applied the qualitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 

2018

 and

 and concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were less than their carrying values. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed.

Intangible Assets

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment if indicators exist in a manner similar to that described above for 

Rental Equipment

. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount. In testing the indefinite-lived intangibles assets for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative test, or a quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, 

Intangibles 

— 

Goodwill and Other

. A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying value. A quantitative impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value.  

In 

2019

, the Company performed a combination of qualitative and quantitative impairment tests over its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets that were quantitatively tested for impairment significantly exceeded their carrying value, and, therefore, 

no

impairment was recognized. Further, the Company concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that were qualitatively tested for impairment were less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed.

Warranties

Warranties are classified as either assurance-type or service-type warranties. A warranty is considered an assurance-type warranty if it provides the customer with assurance that the product will function as intended. A warranty that goes above and beyond ensuring basic functionality is considered a service-type warranty. The Company offers certain limited warranties that are assurance-type warranties and extended service arrangements that are service-type warranties. Assurance-type warranties are not accounted for as separate performance obligations under the revenue model. If a service-type warranty is sold with a product or separately, revenue is recognized over the life of the warranty. 

Sales of many of the Company’s products include assurance-type warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the Company’s marketplaces. The Company records provisions for estimated warranty costs, which are included within Cost of sales, at the time of sale based on historical experience. The Company periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience. Infrequently, a material warranty issue can arise which is beyond the scope of the Company’s historical experience. The Company records costs related to these issues as they become probable and estimable.

The Company also sells optional service-type warranty contracts that extend coverage beyond the initial term of the express warranty period. At the time of sale, revenue related to the service-type warranty contract is deferred and recognized as income over the life of the contract. As of 

December
31, 2019

 and 

2018

, deferred revenue associated with service-type warranty contracts was 

$
3.3
 million

and 

$
3.0
 million

, respectively, and was included within 

Other current liabilities

 and 

Other long-term liabilities

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs under service-type warranty contracts are expensed as incurred.

Workers’ Compensation and Product Liability Reserves

Due to the nature of the Company’s manufacturing and products, the Company is subject to claims for workers’ compensation and product liability in the normal course of business. The Company is self-funded for a portion of these claims. The Company establishes a reserve using a third-party actuary for any known outstanding matters, including a reserve for claims incurred but not yet reported. The amount and timing of cash payments relating to these claims are considered to be reliably determinable given the nature of the claims and historical claim volumes to support the actuarial assumptions and judgments used to derive the expected loss payment patterns. As such, the reserves recorded are discounted using a risk-free rate that matches the average duration of the claims.

The Company has not established a reserve for potential losses resulting from the firefighter hearing loss litigation, with the exception of certain estimated losses that have been recognized related to settlement discussions (see Note

13

 – Legal Proceedings). If the Company is not successful in its defense after exhausting all appellate options, it would record a charge for such claims, to the extent they exceed insurance recoveries, when the related losses become probable and estimable.

Pensions

The Company sponsors domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans. Key assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and estimates of future mortality of plan participants. 

The weighted-average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities and costs is selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality bonds that would provide the necessary cash flow to match the projected benefit payments of the plans.
The discount rate represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of the year-end measurement date.
The weighted-average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities decreased from 

2018

 to 

2019

. See Note

11

 – Pension and Other Post-Employment Plans for further discussion.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and expected returns for the asset classes in which the plans are invested. The Company references the most recent mortality tables and scales published by the Society of Actuaries in determining its estimate of future mortality.

Product Shipping Costs

Product shipping costs are expensed as incurred and are included within Cost of sales.

Research and Development

The Company invests in research to support development of new products and the enhancement of existing products and services. Expenditures for research and development by the Company were 

$
13.6
 million

in 

2019

, 

$
13.0
 million

in 

2018

 and 

$

in 

2017

, and are included within SEG&A expenses.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has various stock-based compensation plans, described more fully in Note

15

 – Stock-Based Compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company estimates the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjusts the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if any. The Company revises its estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from its initial estimates.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax benefit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

The Company files a consolidated U.S.
federal income tax return for Federal Signal Corporation and its eligible domestic subsidiaries. The Company’s non-U.S.
subsidiaries file income tax returns in their respective local jurisdictions. The Company accounts for taxes on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a period expense in the year in which it is incurred.

Accounting standards on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes address the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Under the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company presents interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of 

Income tax expense

.

Litigation Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims, including pending and possible legal actions for product liability and other damages, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of the Company’s business. The Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such claims and actions in the aggregate will not have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. Professional legal fees are expensed when incurred. The Company accrues for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. In the event that estimates or assumptions of contingent losses are different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.

 – 
ACQUISITIONS

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC 805,

Business Combinations

.
In accordance with this guidance, the fair value of consideration transferred is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the completion of the acquisition, with the remaining amount recognized as goodwill. A single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company’s judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results of operations. 

Under ASC 805-10, acquisition-related costs (e.g., advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees) are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred. Acquisition-related costs are included as a component of 

Acquisition and integration-related expenses

 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Acquisition of MRL

On 

July
1, 2019

, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of MRL. The Company expects that MRL will provide an efficient entry into a new line of product offerings and access to new markets. As the acquisition closed on 

July
1, 2019

, the assets and liabilities of MRL have been consolidated into the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of 

December
31, 2019

, while the post-acquisition results of operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, within the Environmental Solutions Group.

The initial cash consideration paid by the Company to acquire MRL was 

$
49.8
 million

, inclusive of a preliminary adjustment for working capital and other post-closing items. The purchase price was subsequently reduced by a final adjustment for working capital and other post-closing items in the amount of 

$
0.8
 million

, which the Company received in the first quarter of 

2020

. In addition, there is a contingent earn-out payment of up to 

$
15.5
 million

, which is contingent upon the achievement of certain financial targets and objectives. The contingent earn-out payment, if earned, would be due to be paid following the third anniversary of the closing.

 – 
REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally this occurs at a point in time, with the transfer of control of the Company’s products or services to customers. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped; however, occasionally control passes later or earlier than shipment due to customer contract or letter of credit terms. 

In circumstances where credit is extended, payment terms generally range from 30 to 120 days and customer deposits may be required.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring products or providing services. 
Expected returns and allowances are estimated and recognized based primarily on an analysis of historical experience, with 

Net sales

 presented net of such returns and allowances.

The Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. These arrangements may include software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products’ essential functionality. The Company identifies all performance obligations that are to be delivered separately under the sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company uses an observable price to determine the standalone selling price or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. In general, performance obligations include hardware, integration and installation services. The allocated revenue for each performance obligation is recognized as such performance obligations are satisfied.

Net sales

. The Company has elected to account for such shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis and are excluded from 

Net sales

Contract Balances

The Company recognizes contract liabilities when cash payments, such as customer deposits, are received in advance of the Company’s satisfaction of the related performance obligations.

Contract liabilities are recognized as Net sales when the related performance obligations are satisfied, which generally occurs within three to six months of the cash receipt.

Contract liability balances are not materially impacted by any other factors. The Company’s contract liabilities were

$
13.9
 million

and

$
12.1
 million

, as of

December

and

2018

, respectively.

Contract assets, such as unbilled receivables, were not material as of any of the periods presented herein.

Practical Expedients

As the Company’s standard payment terms are less than a year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component.

The Company has also elected the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 and recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, as expense when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less. 

Further, as permitted by ASC 606-10-50-14, the Company does not disclose the value of its remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.

LEASES

Impact of the Adoption of Topic 842

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842, using the alternative transition method under ASU 2018-11, which permits application of the new guidance at the beginning of the period of adoption, with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient package outlined in the transition guidance which, among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classifications. In addition, the Company elected to separately account for non-lease and associated lease components and apply the short-term lease exception, whereby the Company does not recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability for leases with an initial term of twelve months or less. 

Upon adoption, the Company recognized operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets of 

$
27.1
 million

and 

$
29.5
 million

, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized the remaining deferred gain of 

$
8.7
 million

associated with the sale-leaseback transactions that the Company entered into in July 2008 for its Elgin, Illinois and University Park, Illinois plant locations, net of the related deferred tax asset of 

$
2.2
 million

, as a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the January 1, 2019 adoption date. Prior to the adoption of Topic 842, the deferred gain, which initially totaled 

$
29.0
 million

, had been amortized through the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the 

15

-year life of the respective leases. Effective in 2019, approximately 

$
1.9
 million

of the deferred gain, which had been recognized each year since 2008, will no longer be recognized through the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Other than the aforementioned elimination of the deferred gain recognition, the adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows. Further, the adoption of Topic 842 did not have an impact on the Company’s liquidity or debt-covenant compliance under its current arrangements.

Description of Leases

The Company leases certain facilities within the U.S., Europe and Canada from which the Company manufactures vehicles and equipment, and provides sales, service and/or equipment rentals. Some of the Company’s lease agreements contain options to renew. The Company also leases vehicles and various other equipment. The Company’s lease agreements may contain lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.

In connection with the 

2019

 acquisition of MRL, the Company entered into lease agreements for 

five

facilities owned by affiliates of the sellers of MRL. With the exception of 

one

lease, which has a term of 

one year

, all such lease agreements have lease terms of 

five years

. All lease agreements contain an annual rent that is considered to be market-based and include options to renew. In 

the year ended December 31, 2019

, total rent paid under these agreements to the former owners of MRL, certain of whom are now employees of the Company, was 

$
0.5
 million

, and the total lease liability as of 

December
31, 2019

 was 

$
4.2
 million

.

In connection with the 2016 acquisition of JJE, the Company entered into lease agreements for 

two

facilities owned by affiliates of the sellers of JJE. Both agreements include an annual rent that is considered market-based, and were for an initial lease term of 

five years

, with options to renew. Total rent paid under these agreements to the former owners of JJE, certain of whom are now employees of the Company, was approximately 

$
0.3

.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental collateralized borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Implicit rates are used when readily determinable. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease term.

The following table summarizes the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments:

On 

July
30, 2019

, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company (the “U.S. Borrower”) and certain of its foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the “Borrowers”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, and the other lenders and parties signatory thereto.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

The 2019 Credit Agreement is a 

$
500
 million

revolving credit facility, maturing on 

July
30, 2024

, that provides for borrowings in the form of loans or letters of credit up to the aggregate availability under the facility, with a sub-limit of 

$
75
 million

for letters of credit. The 2019 Credit Agreement allows for the Borrowers to borrow in denominations of U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros or British Pounds (with borrowings in non-U.S. currencies subject to a sublimit of 

$
200
 million

). In addition, the Company may cause the commitments to increase by up to an additional 

$
250
 million

, subject to the approval of the applicable lenders providing such additional financing.
Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.

The Company’s material domestic subsidiaries provide guarantees for all obligations of the Borrowers under the 2019 Credit Agreement, which is secured by a first priority security interest in (i) all existing or hereafter acquired domestic property and assets of the U.S. Borrower and material domestic subsidiaries, (ii) the stock or other equity interests in each of the material domestic subsidiaries and (iii) 

65
%

of outstanding voting capital stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions.

Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 

zero

to 

0.75
%

for base rate borrowings and 

1.00
%

to 

1.75
%

for LIBOR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between 

0.10
%

to 

0.25
%

per annum on the unused portion of the 

$
500
 million

revolving credit facility along with other standard fees. Letter of credit fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable LIBOR margin plus other customary fees.

The Company is subject to certain net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement that are to be measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of 

December
31, 2019

. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes a series of “covenant holiday” periods, which allow for the temporary increase of the minimum net leverage ratio following the completion of a permitted acquisition, or a series of acquisitions, when the aggregate consideration over a period of twelve months exceeds 

$
75
 million

. In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets; (ii) make certain fundamental business changes, such as mergers, consolidations or any similar combination; (iii) make restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases; (iv) incur indebtedness; (v) make certain loans and investments; (vi) create liens; (vii) transact with affiliates; (viii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions; (ix) make negative pledges; and (x) modify subordinated debt documents.

Under the 2019 Credit Agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, shall be permitted if (i) the Company’s leverage ratio is less than or equal to 

3.25

; (ii) the Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants; and (iii) there are no existing defaults under the 2019 Credit Agreement. If its leverage ratio is more than 

3.25

, the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to 

$
35
 million

of dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (ii) an incremental 

$
50
 million

of other cash payments.

The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement and the commitments from the lenders may be terminated.

The 2019 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s Amended 2016 Credit Agreement (the “2016 Credit Agreement”), which provided the Company with a 

$
400
 million

revolving credit facility.

In connection with the execution of the 2019 Credit Agreement during 

the year ended December 31, 2019

, the Company incurred 

$
1.0
 million

of debt issuance costs. Such fees have been deferred and are being amortized over the 

five

strategy in Spain. Tax expense 

for the year ended December 31, 2017

 was lower than in 

2018

, largely due to the recognition of a 

$
23.0
 million

net tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. following the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“the 2017 Tax Act”). This benefit was partially offset by a 

$
2.2
 million

net increase in valuation allowance, inclusive of a 

$
3.0
 million

valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the recognition of 

$
0.6
 million

of additional tax expense associated with a change in the state tax rate in Illinois, and additional taxes resulting from higher pre-tax earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended 

December
31, 2018

 was 

16.0
%

, compared to 

0.8
%

in 

2017

. The 

2018

 effective tax rate included the effects of the benefit from the tax planning strategy, whereas the 2017 effective tax rate included the aforementioned impacts resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. 

The Company paid income taxes of 

$
25.7
 million

in 

2019

, 

$
21.6
 million

in 

2018

 and 

$
13.9
 million

in

.

Impact of the 2017 Tax Act

In December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted. Among its provisions, the 2017 Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 

35
%

to 

21
%

(effective in 2018), required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings, including a new minimum tax on GILTI. 

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740

,

Income Taxes

, which requires that the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized in the period the tax rate change was enacted. As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company remeasured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower rate, recording a net tax benefit of 

$
23.0
 million

as a component of 

Income tax expense

 on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December
31, 2017. 

In addition, the 2017 Tax Act moved the U.S. from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system and changed the rules that enabled taxpayers to generate foreign source income related to export sales. As a result of these changes, the Company concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that it could utilize its existing foreign tax credits within the applicable carryforward period and
a 

$
3.0
 million

valuation allowance was recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits as of December 31, 2017. 

The 2017 Tax Act also provided a one-time “transition tax” on untaxed post-1986 accumulated earnings and profits (“E&P”) of a company’s controlled foreign corporations (“CFC”) determined as of November 2, 2017 or December
31, 2017 (whichever date on which there is more deferred E&P). Cash and cash equivalents are taxed at an effective rate of 

15.5
%

and earnings in excess of the cash position are taxed at an effective rate of 

8
%

. The 2017 Tax Act permitted the netting of positive earnings of one CFC against deficits of others. At both November 2, 2017 and December
31, 2017, the accumulated undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries aggregated to an overall E&P deficit. Therefore, the Company did not have a transition tax liability under the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. 

Generally, the Company has considered Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the U.S. to be permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund U.S. operations. However, in the event that these funds were needed to fund U.S. operations or to satisfy U.S. obligations, they generally could be repatriated. The repatriation of these funds may cause the Company to incur additional U.S. income tax expense, dependent on income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any such amounts were repatriated. As of 

December
31, 2019

, the Company continues to assert that its undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested.

$
1.1

.

The 

$
66.6
 million

of deferred tax assets at 

December
31, 2019

, for which no valuation allowance is recorded, is anticipated to be realized through future taxable income or the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as deferred tax liabilities at 

December
31, 2019

. Should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize its remaining deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made.

Valuation Allowances

ASC 740

,

Income Taxes

, also requires that the future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income. If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets.

We continually evaluate the need to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

— 
PENSION AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT PLANS 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company and its subsidiaries sponsor 

two

defined benefit pension plans covering certain salaried and hourly employees. These plans have been closed to new participants for a number of years. Benefits under these plans are primarily based on final average compensation and years of service as defined within the provisions of the individual plans. As a result of plan amendments, the latest of which was in 2008, the only new benefits that were being accrued through the end of 

2016

 were salary increases for a limited group of participants. Those benefits ceased at the end of 

2016

, at which point all existing plans became fully frozen.

In October 2018, the U.K. High Court ruled that certain formulas used to calculate guaranteed minimum pension (“GMP”) benefits violated gender-pay equality laws. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ruling on its non-U.S. benefit plan’s GMP benefit formulas and monitoring for additional regulatory and interpretive developments. While the non-U.S. benefit plan has not yet been amended to address the ruling, the Company has recognized the estimated impact, resulting in a

In September 2017, the Company executed an amendment to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which enabled the Company to announce a limited-time voluntary lump-sum pension offering to eligible, terminated, vested plan participants. In connection with the offering, 

516

individuals elected to receive a lump-sum settlement payment. In the aggregate, the Company paid a total of 

$
13.7
 million

in lump-sum benefit payments during 

the year ended December 31, 2017

, using assets of the plan. As total benefit payments during 

the year ended December 31, 2017

 exceeded the sum of the service and interest cost, the Company was required to measure the liabilities of the benefit plans and recognize a settlement charge of 

$
6.1
 million

, in accordance with ASC 715, 

Compensation – Retirement Benefits.

 – Fair Value Measurements, the Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. 

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value for the U.S. benefit
plan:

[TABLE]

•

Cash and cash equivalents
are comprised of cash on deposit and a money market fund, that invests principally in short-term instruments. The money-market fund is valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) of the shares in the fund.

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Equity investments represent domestic and foreign securities, including common stock, which are publicly traded on active exchanges and are valued based on quoted market prices. Certain equity securities, which are valued using a model that takes the underlying security’s 

“

best

”

 price, divides it by the applicable exchange rate and multiplies the result by a depository receipt factor, are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Fixed income investments include corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and treasury bonds. Corporate bonds are valued using pricing models that include bids provided by brokers or dealers, benchmark yields, base spreads and reported trades. Asset-backed securities are valued using models with readily observable data as inputs. Treasury bonds are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets.

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Real estate investments include public real estate investment trusts (“REIT”) and exchange traded REIT funds, which are publicly traded on active exchanges and are valued based on quoted market prices. 

[/TABLE]

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value for the non-U.S. benefit
plan:

[TABLE]

•

Diversified investment funds are valued based on a daily NAV per share measured by the fund sponsor and used as the basis for current transactions. 

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Fixed income investments include treasury securities, which are valued based on quoted market prices in active markets, and corporate bonds which are either valued based on quoted market prices in active markets or other readily observable market data.

[/TABLE]

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The following summarizes the Company’s pension assets in a three-tier fair value hierarchy for its benefit plans:

[TABLE]

(a) 

These funds primarily invest in a diversified portfolio of equity securities and fixed income securities.

[/TABLE]

The Company maintains a structured investment strategy for the U.S.
pension plan to improve alignment of assets and liabilities that includes: (i) maintaining a diversified portfolio that can provide a near-term weighted-average target return of approximately 

7.0
%

or more, (ii) maintaining liquidity to meet obligations and (iii)
prudently managing administrative and management costs. The target asset allocations for the U.S. pension plan are (i) between 

53
%

and 

73
%

in equity investments, (ii) between 

25
%

and 

35
%

in fixed income investments and (iii) between 

0
%

and 

20
%

in cash and cash equivalents. Other investments may include real estate investments and mutual funds investing in real estate, commodities or hedge funds. 

The investment strategy for the non-U.S. pension plan is designed to achieve certain target asset allocations depending on the plan’s relative funded status. Plan assets for the non-U.S.
benefit plan consist principally of a portfolio of diversified investment funds, U.K. government securities and corporate bonds. The target asset allocations for the non-U.S. benefit plan assets are generally between 

65
%

and 

75
%

in fixed income investments and between 

25
%

and 

35

FEDERAL SIGNAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

The following summarizes the amounts recognized within our Consolidated Balance Sheets:

As the Company’s benefit plans are fully frozen, all plan participants are now considered to be inactive. As a result, the associated actuarial losses and prior service costs that are included in 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

 are being amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the remaining average life expectancy of plan participants. The Company expects 

$
3.7
 million

of the actuarial losses and 

$
0.1
 million

of the prior service costs to be amortized from 

Accumulated other comprehensive loss

 into net periodic benefit cost in 

2020

. 

In 

2020

, the Company currently expects to contribute up to 

$
6.9
 million

to the U.S. benefit plan and up to 

$
1.3
 million

to the non-U.S.
benefit plan. Future contributions to the plans will be based on such factors as annual service cost, the financial return on plan assets, interest rate movements that affect discount rates applied to plan liabilities and the value of benefit payments made.

The following summarizes the benefits expected to be paid under the Company’s defined benefit plans in each of the next five years, and in aggregate for the five years thereafter:

Defined Contribution Retirement Plan

The Company also sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan (the “401(k) plan”) covering a majority of its employees. Participation is via automatic enrollment and employees may elect to opt out of the 401(k) plan. Company contributions to the 401(k) plan are based on an employee’s years of service, as well as the percentage of employee contributions. The Company’s cost of the 401(k) plan was 

$
7.9
 million

in 

2019

, 

$
7.2
 million

in 

2018

 and 

$
6.9
 million

in 

2017

.

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company also provides a deferred compensation plan to certain employees. The deferred compensation plan is a non-qualified, unfunded defined contribution plan, which provides participants with benefits that would have been provided under the 401(k) plan, but could not be provided due to compensation limits for qualified plans under the Internal Revenue Code. At 

December
31, 2019

 and 

2018

, deferred compensation liabilities of 

$
11.1
 million

and 

$
7.5
 million

, respectively, were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, primarily within 

Long-term pension and other post-retirement benefit liabilities

.

Multi-Employer Pension Plans

The Company also participates in two multi-employer pension plans that provide defined benefits to employees under U.S. collective bargaining agreements, as follows:

[TABLE]

(a)

Indicates whether the plan has a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) which is either pending or has been implemented.

[TABLE]

(c)

The IAM National Pension Fund was initially certified in the Yellow Zone for 2019. In April 2019, the Trustees of the IAM National Pension Fund voluntarily elected to place the IAM National Pension Fund in the Red Zone, adopted a Rehabilitation Plan, and imposed a surcharge.

[/TABLE]

Contributions to these plans totaled 

$
0.2
 million

, 

$
0.2
 million

and 

$
0.2
 million

for 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

, respectively. The Company’s contributions do not represent more than 5% of the total contributions to the plans as indicated in their most recently available annual reports dated 

December
31, 2018

.

The risks of participating in a multi-employer pension plan are different from a single-employer plan in that (i) assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in the multi-employer pension plan, the Company may be required to pay the plan an amount based on the unfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Financial Commitments

The Company provides indemnifications and other guarantees in the ordinary course of business, the terms of which range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Specifically, the Company is occasionally required to provide letters of credit and bid and performance bonds to various customers, principally to act as security for retention levels related to casualty insurance policies and to guarantee the performance of subsidiaries that engage in export and domestic transactions. At 

December
31, 2019

, the Company had outstanding performance and financial standby letters of credit, as well as outstanding bid and performance bonds, aggregating to 

$
23.8
 million

. If any such letters of credit or bonds are called, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond. The Company believes the likelihood of any currently outstanding letter of credit or bond being called is remote. 

The Company has transactions involving the sale of equipment to certain of its customers which include (i) guarantees to repurchase the equipment for a fixed price at a future date and (ii) guarantees to repurchase the equipment from the third-party lender in the event of default by the customer. As of 

December
31, 2019

, the single year and maximum potential cash payments the Company could be required to make to repurchase equipment under these agreements were 

$
3.5
 million

and 

$
3.8
 million

, respectively. The Company’s risk under these repurchase arrangements would be partially mitigated by the value of the products repurchased as part of the transaction. Historical cash requirements and losses associated with these obligations have not been significant, but could increase if customer defaults exceed current expectations.

Product Warranties

The Company issues product performance warranties to customers with the sale of its products. The specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending upon the product sold and country in which the Company does business, with warranty periods generally ranging from 

one

 to 

five years

. The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the sale of the related product is recognized. Factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include (i) the number of units under warranty, (ii) historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and (iii) costs per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s warranty liabilities:

As of 

December
31, 2019

 and 

2018

, an estimated liability was recorded within the Environmental Solutions Group in connection with a specific warranty matter. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimate may change in the near term as more information becomes available; however, the ultimate resolution of this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Environmental Liabilities

In May 2012, the Company sold a facility in Pearland, Texas. The facility was previously used by the Company’s discontinued Pauluhn business, which manufactured marine, offshore and industrial lighting products. The site is in the process of remediation, and it is probable that the site will incur future costs. As such, as of 

December
31, 2019

 and 

2018

, environmental remediation reserves of 

$
0.3
 million

and 

$
0.4
 million

, respectively, have been included in liabilities of discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recorded reserves are based on an undiscounted estimate of the range of costs to remediate the site, depending upon the remediation approach and other factors. The Company’s estimate may change in the near-term as more information becomes available; however, the costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

NOTE

— 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various claims, including pending and possible legal actions for product liability and other damages, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of the Company’s business. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews uninsured material legal claims against the Company and accrues for the costs of such claims as appropriate in the exercise of management’s best judgment and experience.
However, due to a lack of factual information available to the Company about a claim, or the procedural stage of a claim, it may not be possible for the Company to reasonably assess either the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome of the claim or to reasonably estimate the amount of loss should there be an unfavorable outcome.
Therefore, for many claims, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss.

The Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such claims and actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flow.

Hearing Loss Litigation

The Company has been sued for monetary damages by firefighters who claim that exposure to the Company’s sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are therefore defective. There were 

33

cases filed during the period of 1999 through 2004, involving a total of 

2,443

plaintiffs, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. These cases involved more than 

1,800

firefighter plaintiffs from locations outside of Chicago. In 2009, 

six

additional cases were filed in Cook County, involving 

299

Pennsylvania firefighter plaintiffs. During 2013, another case was filed in Cook County involving 

74

Pennsylvania firefighter plaintiffs.

The trial of the first 

27

of these plaintiffs’ claims occurred in 2008, whereby a Cook County jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company.

An additional 

40

Chicago firefighter plaintiffs were selected for trial in 2009. Plaintiffs’ counsel later moved to reduce the number of plaintiffs from 

40

to 

nine

. The trial for these 

nine

plaintiffs concluded with a verdict against the Company and for the plaintiffs in varying amounts totaling 

$
0.4
 million

. The Company appealed this verdict. On September
13, 2012, the Illinois Appellate Court rejected this appeal. The Company thereafter filed a petition for rehearing with the Illinois Appellate Court, which was denied on February
7, 2013. The Company sought further review by filing a petition for leave to appeal with the Illinois Supreme Court on March
14, 2013. On May
29, 2013, the Illinois Supreme Court issued a summary order declining to 

67

FEDERAL SIGNAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

accept review of this case. On July
1, 2013, the Company satisfied the judgments entered for these plaintiffs, which resulted in final dismissal of these cases.

A third consolidated trial involving 

eight

Chicago firefighter plaintiffs occurred during November 2011.
The jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company at the conclusion of this trial.

Following this trial, on March
12, 2012 the trial court entered an order certifying a class of the remaining Chicago Fire Department firefighter plaintiffs for trial on the sole issue of whether the Company’s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. The Company petitioned the Illinois Appellate Court for interlocutory appeal of this ruling. On May
17, 2012, the Illinois Appellate Court accepted the Company’s petition. On June
8, 2012, plaintiffs moved to dismiss the appeal, agreeing with the Company that the trial court had erred in certifying a class action trial in this matter. Pursuant to plaintiffs’ motion, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the trial court’s certification order.

Thereafter, the trial court scheduled a fourth consolidated trial involving 

three

firefighter plaintiffs, which began in December
2012. Prior to the start of this trial, the claims of 

two

of the 

three

firefighter plaintiffs were dismissed. On December
17, 2012, the jury entered a complete defense verdict for the Company.

Following this defense verdict, plaintiffs again moved to certify a class of Chicago Fire Department plaintiffs for trial on the sole issue of whether the Company’s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. Over the Company’s objection, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification on March
11, 2013 and scheduled a class action trial to begin on June
10, 2013.
The Company filed a petition for review with the Illinois Appellate Court on March
29, 2013 seeking reversal of the class certification order. 

On June 25, 2014, a unanimous three-judge panel of the First District Illinois Appellate Court issued its opinion reversing the class certification order of the trial court. Specifically, the Appellate Court determined that the trial court’s ruling failed to satisfy the class-action requirements that the common issues of the firefighters’ claims predominate over the individual issues and that there is an adequate representative for the class. During a status hearing on October 8, 2014, plaintiffs represented to the Court that they would again seek to certify a class of firefighters on the issue of whether the Company’s sirens were defective and unreasonably dangerous. On January 12, 2015, plaintiffs filed motions to amend their complaints to add class action allegations with respect to Chicago firefighter plaintiffs, as well as the approximately 

1,800

firefighter plaintiffs from locations outside of Chicago. On March 11, 2015, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motions to amend their complaints. On April 24, 2015, the cases were transferred to Cook County chancery court, which will decide all class certification issues. On March 23, 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion to certify as a class all firefighters from the Chicago Fire Department who have filed lawsuits in this matter. The parties have requested discovery from each other related to this motion. The court has directed the parties to appear on April 30, 2020 to address the issue of discovery and other matters. The Company intends to continue its objections to any attempt at certification. 

The Company has also filed motions to dismiss cases involving firefighters who worked for fire departments located outside of the State of Illinois based on improper venue. On February 24, 2017, the Circuit Court of Cook County entered orders dismissing the cases of 

1,770

such firefighter plaintiffs from the jurisdiction of the State of Illinois. Pursuant to these orders, these plaintiffs had six months thereafter to refile their cases in jurisdictions where these firefighters are located. Prior to this six-month deadline, attorneys representing some of these plaintiffs contacted the Company regarding possible settlement of their cases. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company entered into a global settlement agreement with two attorneys who represented approximately 

1,090

of these plaintiffs. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company offered 

$
700

per plaintiff to settle these cases and 

717

plaintiffs accepted this offer as a final settlement. The attorneys representing these plaintiffs agreed to withdraw from representing plaintiffs who did not respond to the settlement offer. It is the Company’s position that the non-settling plaintiffs who failed to timely refile their cases following the February 2017 dismissal by the Circuit Court of Cook County are now barred from doing so by the statute of limitations. The Company filed a venue motion seeking to transfer to DuPage County cases involving 

10

plaintiffs who reside and work in Illinois but outside of Cook County. The Court granted this motion on June 28, 2017.

The Company has also been sued on this issue outside of the Cook County, Illinois venue. Between 2007 and 2009, a total of 

71

lawsuits involving 

71

plaintiffs were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. 

Three

of these cases were dismissed pursuant to pretrial motions filed by the Company. Another case was voluntarily dismissed. Prior to trial in 

four

cases, the Company paid nominal sums to obtain dismissals.

Three

trials occurred in Philadelphia involving these cases filed in 2007 through 2009. The first trial involving 

one

of these plaintiffs occurred in 2010, when the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff. In particular, the jury found that the Company’s 

68

Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

siren was not defectively designed, but that the Company negligently constructed the siren. The jury awarded damages in the amount of 

$
0.1
 million

, which was subsequently reduced to 

$
0.08
 million

. The Company appealed this verdict. Another trial, involving 

nine

Philadelphia firefighter plaintiffs, also occurred in 2010 when the jury returned a defense verdict for the Company as to all claims and all plaintiffs involved in that trial. The third trial, also involving 

nine

Philadelphia firefighter plaintiffs, was completed during 2010 when the jury returned a defense verdict for the Company as to all claims and all plaintiffs involved in that trial.

Following defense verdicts in the last 

two

Philadelphia trials, the Company negotiated settlements with respect to all remaining filed cases in Philadelphia at that time, as well as other firefighter claimants represented by the attorney who filed the Philadelphia cases. On January
4, 2011, the Company entered into a Global Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with the law firm of the attorney representing the Philadelphia claimants, on behalf of 

1,125

claimants the firm represented (the “Claimants”) and who had asserted product claims against the Company (the “Claims”). 

Three hundred eight

of the Claimants had lawsuits pending against the Company in Cook County, Illinois.

The Settlement Agreement provided that the Company pay a total amount of 

$
3.8
 million

(the “Settlement Payment”) to settle the Claims (including the costs, fees and other expenses of the law firm in connection with its representation of the Claimants), subject to certain terms, conditions and procedures set forth in the Settlement Agreement. In order for the Company to be required to make the Settlement Payment: (i)
each Claimant who agreed to settle his or her claims had to sign a release acceptable to the Company (a “Release”), (ii)
each Claimant who agreed to the settlement and who was a plaintiff in a lawsuit, had to dismiss his or her lawsuit with prejudice, (iii)
by April
29, 2011, at least 

93
%

of the Claimants identified in the Settlement Agreement must have agreed to settle their claims and provide a signed Release to the Company and (iv)
the law firm had to withdraw from representing any Claimants who did not agree to the settlement, including those who filed lawsuits. If the conditions to the settlement were met, but less than 

100
%

of the Claimants agreed to settle their Claims and sign a Release, the Settlement Payment would be reduced by the percentage of Claimants who did not agree to the settlement.

On April
22, 2011, the Company confirmed that the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement had been met and made a payment of 

$
3.6
 million

to conclude the settlement. The amount was based upon the Company’s receipt of 

1,069

signed releases provided by Claimants, which was 

95
%

of all Claimants identified in the Settlement Agreement.

The Company generally denies the allegations made in the claims and lawsuits by the Claimants and denies that its products caused any injuries to the Claimants. Nonetheless, the Company entered into the Settlement Agreement for the purpose of minimizing its expenses, including legal fees, and avoiding the inconvenience, uncertainty and distraction of the claims and lawsuits.

During April through October 2012, 

20

new cases were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. These cases were filed on behalf of 

20

Philadelphia firefighters and involve various defendants in addition to the Company. 

Five

of these cases were subsequently dismissed. The first trial involving these 2012 Philadelphia cases occurred during December 2014 and involved 

three

firefighter plaintiffs. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company. Following this trial, all of the parties agreed to settle cases involving 

seven

firefighter plaintiffs set for trial during January 2015 for nominal amounts per plaintiff. 

In January 2015, plaintiffs’ attorneys filed 

two

new complaints in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on behalf of approximately 

70

additional firefighter plaintiffs. The vast majority of the firefighters identified in these complaints are located outside of Pennsylvania. 

One

of the complaints in these cases, which involves 

11

firefighter plaintiffs from the District of Columbia, was removed to federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all claims in this case on May 31, 2016. The Company thereafter moved to recover various fees and costs in this case, asserting that plaintiffs’ counsel failed to properly investigate these claims prior to filing suit. The Court granted this motion on April 25, 2017, awarding 

$
0.1
 million

to the Company. After plaintiffs appealed this Order, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the lower court decision awarding fees and costs to the Company.

With respect to claims of other out-of-state firefighters involved in these 

two

cases, the Company moved to dismiss these claims as improperly filed in Pennsylvania. The Court granted this motion and dismissed these claims on November 5, 2015. During August through December 2015, another 

nine

new cases were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. These cases involve a total of 

193

firefighters, most of whom are located outside of Pennsylvania. The Company again moved to dismiss all claims filed by out-of-state firefighters in these cases as improperly filed in Pennsylvania. On May 24, 2016, the Court granted this motion and dismissed these claims. Plaintiffs appealed this decision and, on September 25, 2018, the appellate court reversed this dismissal. The Company has filed a petition with the appellate court requesting that the court reconsider its ruling. On December 7, 2018, the appellate court granted the Company’s petition and withdrew its prior

decision. The Court has ordered that the parties file additional briefs and a new panel of appellate judges issue a decision. The parties have supplied briefs to the Court and the Court has heard oral argument on this case. The Company is awaiting a decision in this case. 

On May 13, 2016, 

four

new cases were filed in Philadelphia state court, involving a total of 

55

Philadelphia firefighters who live in Pennsylvania. During August 2016, the Company settled a case involving 

four

Philadelphia firefighters that had been set for trial in Philadelphia state court during September 2016. During 2017, plaintiffs filed additional cases in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, involving over 

100

Philadelphia firefighter plaintiffs. During January 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate and bifurcate, similar to a motion filed in the Pittsburgh hearing loss cases, as described below. The Company has filed an opposition to this motion. These cases were then transferred to the mass tort program in Philadelphia for pretrial purposes. Plaintiffs’ counsel thereafter dismissed several plaintiffs. During November 2017, a trial involving 

one

Philadelphia firefighter occurred. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Company in this trial. Prior to a dismissal of these cases pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, discussed below, there was a total of 

75

firefighters involved in cases pending in the Philadelphia mass tort program. 

During April through July 2013, additional cases were filed in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on behalf of 

247

plaintiff firefighters from Pittsburgh and against various defendants, including the Company. During May 2016, 

two

additional cases were filed against the Company in Allegheny County involving 

19

Pittsburgh firefighters. After the Company filed pretrial motions, the Court dismissed claims of 

55

Pittsburgh firefighter plaintiffs. The Court scheduled trials for May, September and November 2016, for 

eight

firefighters per trial. Prior to the first scheduled trial in Pittsburgh, the Court granted the Company’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed all claims asserted by plaintiff firefighters involved in this trial. Following an appeal by the plaintiff firefighters, the appellate court affirmed this dismissal. The next trial for 

six

Pittsburgh firefighters started on November 7, 2016. Shortly after this trial began, plaintiffs’ counsel moved for a mistrial because a key witness suddenly became unavailable. The Court granted this motion and rescheduled this trial for March 6, 2017. During January 2017, plaintiffs also moved to consolidate and bifurcate trials involving Pittsburgh firefighters. In particular, plaintiffs sought one trial involving liability issues which will apply to all Pittsburgh firefighters who filed suit against the Company. The Company filed an opposition to this motion. On April 18, 2017, the trial court granted plaintiffs’ motion to bifurcate the next Pittsburgh trial. Pursuant to a motion for clarification filed by the Company, the Court ruled that the bifurcation order would only apply to 

six

plaintiffs who were part of the next trial group in Pittsburgh. The Company thereafter sought an interlocutory appeal of the Court’s bifurcation order. The appellate court declined to accept the appeal at that time. A bifurcated trial began on September 27, 2017 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Prior to and during trial, 

two

plaintiffs were dismissed, resulting in 

four

plaintiffs remaining for trial. After approximately two weeks of trial, the jury found that the Company’s siren product was not defective or unreasonably dangerous and rendered a verdict in favor of the Company. 

A second trial involving Pittsburgh firefighters began during January 2018. At the outset of this trial, plaintiffs’ attorneys requested that the Company consider settlement of various cases. This trial was continued to allow the parties to further discuss possible settlement. During March 2018, the parties agreed in principle on a framework (the “Settlement Framework”) to resolve hearing loss claims and cases in all jurisdictions involved in the hearing loss litigation except in Cook County and Lackawanna County, and excluding 

one

case involving 

one

firefighter in New York City. The firefighters excluded from the Settlement Framework are represented by different attorneys. The Company has agreed in principle to settle the cases in Lackawanna County and the case involving 

one

firefighter in New York City for nominal amounts. Pursuant to the Settlement Framework, the Company would pay 

$
700

to each firefighter who has filed a lawsuit and is eligible to be part of the settlement. The Company would pay 

$
300

to each firefighter who has not yet filed a case and is eligible to be part of the settlement. To be eligible for settlement, among other things, firefighters must provide proof that they have high frequency noise-induced hearing loss. There are approximately 

3,700

firefighters whose claims may be considered as part of this settlement, including approximately 

1,320

firefighters who have ongoing filed lawsuits. This Settlement Framework was finalized in a global settlement agreement executed on November 4, 2019. Pursuant to this global settlement agreement, the parties are now in the process of determining how many of the approximately 

3,700

firefighters will be eligible to participate in the settlement. In order to minimize the parties’ respective legal costs and expenses during this settlement process, on July 5, 2018, the parties entered into a tolling agreement (the “Tolling Agreement”). Pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, counsel for the settling firefighters agreed to dismiss the pending lawsuits in all jurisdictions except for the Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania cases, and the Company agreed to a tolling of any statute of limitations applicable to the dismissed cases. The Tolling Agreement continued in place until the parties executed the global settlement agreement on November 4, 2019. After execution of the global settlement agreement, the Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) cases were dismissed. The global settlement agreement requires plaintiffs’ attorneys to withdraw from representing firefighters who elect not to participate in this settlement.

As of 

December
31, 2019

, the Company has recognized an estimated liability for the potential settlement amount. While it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of this matter may result in a loss in excess of the amount accrued, the incremental loss is not expected to be material. 

During March 2014, an action also was brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Pennsylvania on behalf of 

61

firefighters.
This case likewise involves various defendants in addition to the Company. After the Company filed pretrial motions, 

33

Erie County firefighter plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims. During August 2017, 

five

cases involving 

70

firefighter plaintiffs were filed in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. These cases involve firefighter plaintiffs who originally filed in Cook County and were dismissed pursuant to the Company’s forum nonconveniens motion. As of 

December
31, 2019

, a total of 

263

firefighters are involved in cases filed in Allegheny and Lackawanna counties in Pennsylvania. 

On September 17, 2014, 

20

lawsuits, involving a total of 

193

Buffalo Fire Department firefighters, were filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Erie County. All of the cases filed in Erie County, New York have been removed to federal court in the Western District of New York. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to consolidate and bifurcate these cases, similar to the motion filed in the Pittsburgh hearing loss cases, as described above. The Company has filed an opposition to the motion. During February 2015, a lawsuit involving 

one

New York City firefighter plaintiff was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County. The plaintiff named the Company as well as several other parties as defendants. That case subsequently was transferred to federal court in the Northern District of New York and thereafter dismissed. During April 2015 through January 2016, 

29

new cases involving a total of 

235

firefighters were filed in various counties in the New York City area. During December 2016 through October 2017, additional cases were filed in these jurisdictions. On February 5, 2018, the Company was served with a complaint in an additional case filed in Kings County, New York. This case involves 

one

plaintiff. Prior to a dismissal of these cases pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, there was a total of 

536

firefighters involved in cases filed in the State of New York.

During November 2015, the Company was served with a complaint filed in Union County, New Jersey state court, involving 

34

New Jersey firefighters. This case has been transferred to federal court in the District of New Jersey. During the period from January through May 2016, 

eight

additional cases were filed in various New Jersey state courts. Most of the firefighters in these cases reside in New Jersey and work or worked at New Jersey fire departments. During December 2016, a case involving 

one

New Jersey firefighter was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey. On May 2, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate and bifurcate in the pending federal court case in New Jersey. This motion was similar to bifurcation motions filed by plaintiffs in Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Philadelphia. The Court has denied this motion as premature. Pursuant to a petition filed by both parties, all New Jersey state court cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes. Prior to a dismissal of these cases pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, there was a total of 

61

firefighters involved in cases filed in New Jersey.

During May through October 2016, 

nine

cases were filed in Suffolk County, Massachusetts state court, naming the Company as a defendant. These cases involve 

194

firefighters who lived and worked in the Boston area. During August 2017, plaintiffs filed additional cases in Suffolk County court. The Company moved to transfer various cases filed in Suffolk County to other counties in Massachusetts where plaintiffs reside and work. Prior to a dismissal of these cases pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, there was a total of 

218

firefighters involved in cases filed in Massachusetts.

During August and September 2017, plaintiffs’ attorneys filed additional hearing loss cases in Florida. The Company is the only named defendant. These cases were filed in several different counties in Florida, including Tampa, Miami and Orlando municipalities. Plaintiffs have agreed to stipulate that they will not seek more than 

$
75,000

in damages in any individual plaintiff case. Prior to a dismissal of these cases pursuant to the Tolling Agreement, there was a total of 

166

firefighters involved in cases filed in Florida.

From 2007 through 2009, firefighters also brought hearing loss claims against the Company in New Jersey, Missouri, Maryland and Kings County, New York. All of those cases, however, were dismissed prior to trial, including 

four

cases in the Supreme Court of Kings County, New York that were dismissed upon the Company’s motion in 2008. On appeal, the New York appellate court affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of these cases. Plaintiffs’ attorneys have threatened to file additional lawsuits. The Company intends to vigorously defend all of these lawsuits, if filed.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, 

Earnings per Share

, which requires that non-vested restricted stock containing non-forfeitable dividend rights should be treated as participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is reduced by the amount of dividends declared in the period for common stock and participating securities. The remaining undistributed earnings are then allocated to common stock and participating securities as if all of the net income for the period had been distributed. The amounts of distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities for the 

years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

 were insignificant and did not materially impact the calculation of basic or diluted EPS.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the year. 

Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and non-vested restricted stock awards outstanding for the year, plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the year. The dilutive effect of common stock equivalents is determined using the more dilutive of the two-class method or alternative methods. We use the treasury stock method to determine the potentially dilutive impact of our employee stock options and restricted stock units, and the contingently issuable method for our performance-based restricted stock unit awards. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017

, options to purchase 

0.2

, 

0.3

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock compensation plan, approved by the Company’s stockholders and administered by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “CBC”), provides for the grant of incentive stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards or units to key employees and directors. The plan authorizes the grant of up to 

7.8
 million

shares or units through 

April 2025

. At 

December
31, 2019

, approximately 

4.0
 million

shares were available for future issuance under the plan. 

The total compensation expense related to all grants awarded under the plan was

and 

$
4.6

Stock Options

Stock options vest ratably (i.e. one-third annually) over the 

three years

from the date of the grant. The cost of stock options, based on their fair value at the date of grant, is charged to expense over the respective vesting periods. Stock options normally

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

become exercisable at a rate of one-third annually and in full on the third anniversary date. Under the plan, all options and rights must be exercised within ten years from date of grant. At the Company’s discretion, vested stock option holders are permitted to elect an alternative settlement method in lieu of purchasing common stock at the option price. The alternative settlement method permits the employee to receive, without payment to the Company, cash, shares of common stock or a combination thereof equal to the excess of market value of common stock over the option purchase price. The Company has historically settled all such options in common stock and intends to continue to do so. Stock options do not have voting or dividend rights until such time that the options are exercised and shares have been issued.

The weighted average fair value of options granted during 

2019

, 

2018

 and 

2017

 was 

$
8.48

, 

$
7.17

and 

$
7.00

, respectively.

The fair value of each option grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Dividend yields are based on historical dividend payments. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options. The expected life of options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and the Company’s historical exercise patterns.

The following summarizes stock option activity:

At 

December
31, 2019

, options that have vested and are expected to vest totaled 

2.3
 million

shares, with a weighted average exercise price of 

$
13.60

, and represent the sum of 

1.9
 million

vested (or exercisable) options and 

0.4
 million

options that are expected to vest.
Options that are expected to vest
are derived by applying the pre-vesting forfeiture rate assumption against outstanding, unvested options as of

Restricted Stock

Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units primarily cliff vest at the third anniversary from the date of grant, provided the recipient is still employed by the Company on the vesting date. The cost of restricted stock, based on the fair market value of the underlying shares determined using the closing market price on the date of grant, is charged to expense over the respective vesting periods. Shares associated with non-vested restricted stock awards have the same voting rights as the Company’s common stock and have non-forfeitable rights to dividends. Shares associated with non-vested restricted stock units do not have voting or dividend rights.

Performance Awards

In each of the three years in the period ended 

December
31, 2019

, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock unit awards (“PSUs”) to certain executives and other non-executive officers. Performance targets associated with PSUs are set annually and approved by the CBC. At the Company’s discretion, actual payment of the awards earned shall be in cash or in common stock of the Company, or in a combination of both. The Company intends to settle all such awards by issuing shares of its common stock. The number of shares of common stock that the Company may issue in connection with these PSUs can range from 

0
%

to 

200
%

of target, depending upon achievement against the performance targets. Shares associated with non-vested PSUs do not have voting or dividend rights until issuance. The Company assesses the probability of vesting, based on expected achievement against these performance targets, on a quarterly basis. 

The cost of PSUs, based on their fair market value determined using the closing market price on the date of grant, is charged to expense over the respective vesting periods, which is the three-year period ended

Corporate contains those items that are not included in our reportable segments.

Net sales by reportable segment reflect sales of products and services to external customers, as reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intersegment sales are insignificant. The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective segment. Operating income includes all revenues, costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved. In determining reportable segment income, neither corporate nor interest expenses are included. Reportable segment depreciation and amortization expense, identifiable assets and capital expenditures relate to those assets that are utilized by the respective reportable segment. Corporate assets consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and fixed assets. The accounting policies of each reportable segment are the same as those described in Note

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions about valuation based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three levels of inputs are classified as follows: 

[TABLE]

•

Level
1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Level 2 — observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and 

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Level 3 — unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

[/TABLE]

In determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches within the fair value measurement framework. The valuation methodologies used for the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value and their classification in the valuation hierarchy are summarized below:

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents primarily consist of time-based deposits and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less. The Company classified cash equivalents as Level
1 due to the short-term nature of these instruments and measured the fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

Interest Rate Swaps

As described in Note 

9

 – Debt, the Company may, from time to time, execute interest rate swaps as a means of fixing the floating interest rate component on a portion of its floating-rate debt. The Company classifies its interest rate swaps as Level 2 due to the use of a discounted cash flow model based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve (Level 2 inputs) to calculate the fair value of the swaps.

Contingent Consideration

As further described in Note 

2

 – Acquisitions, the Company has a contingent obligation to transfer up to 

$
15.5
 million

to the former owners of MRL if specified financial results are met over future reporting periods (i.e., an earn-out). In addition, during 

the year ended December 31, 2019

, the Company paid 

$
7.6
 million

to settle the contingent consideration liability due to the former owners of JJE based on the achievement of specified financial results over the three-year period following the closing of the acquisition. 

Liabilities for contingent consideration are measured at fair value each reporting period, with the acquisition-date fair value included as part of the consideration transferred. Subsequent changes in fair value are included as a component of 

Acquisition and integration-related expenses

 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Table of Contents

FEDERAL SIGNAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (CONTINUED)

The Company uses an income approach to value the contingent consideration obligation based on the present value of risk-adjusted future cash flows under either a scenario-based or option-pricing method, as appropriate. Due to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as prospective financial information or probabilities of future events, the Company has classified the contingent consideration liability within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy outlined in ASC 820, 

Fair Value Measurements

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED)

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, 

Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements

, which sets forth an expected credit losses model, that requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, 

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)

, which eliminates certain disclosure requirements, such as the amount of, and reasons for, transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. This ASU adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, 

Income Taxes (Topic 740), Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

, which is intended to simplify various aspects related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective basis, depending on the area covered by the update. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

No other new accounting pronouncements issued, but not yet adopted, are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.
