Narrative Description of Business 

[/TABLE]

PACCAR is a multinational company operating in three principal industry segments: 

[TABLE]

(1)

The Truck segment includes the design, manufacture and distribution of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. Heavy-duty trucks have a gross vehicle weight (GVW) of over 33,000 lbs (Class 8) in North America and over 16 metric tonnes in Europe. Medium-duty trucks have a GVW ranging from 19,500 to 33,000 lbs (Class 6 to 7) in North America, and in Europe, light- and medium-duty trucks range between 6 and 16 metric tonnes. Trucks are configured with engine in front of cab (conventional) or cab-over-engine (COE).

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

(2)

The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

(3)

The Financial Services segment includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers. PACCAR’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to PACCAR products and associated equipment. 

[/TABLE]

PACCAR’s Other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches.

TRUCKS

PACCAR’s trucks are marketed under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates. These trucks, which are built in three plants in the United States, three in Europe and one each in Australia, Brasil, Canada and Mexico, are used worldwide for over-the-road and off-highway hauling of commercial and consumer goods. The Company also manufactures engines, primarily for use in the Company’s trucks, at its facilities in Columbus, Mississippi; Eindhoven, the Netherlands; and Ponta Grossa, Brasil. PACCAR competes in the North American Class 8 market, primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Chillicothe, Ohio; Denton, Texas; Renton, Washington; Mexicali, Mexico and Ste. Therese, Canada. PACCAR also competes in the North American Class 6 to 7 markets primarily with Kenworth and Peterbilt conventional models. These trucks are assembled at facilities in Ste. Therese, Canada; Denton, Texas, and Mexicali, Mexico. PACCAR competes in the European light/medium market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the United Kingdom (U.K.) by Leyland, one of PACCAR’s wholly owned subsidiaries, and participates in the European heavy market with DAF COE trucks assembled in the Netherlands and the U.K. PACCAR competes in the Brazilian heavy truck market with DAF models assembled at Ponta Grossa in the state of Paraná, Brasil. PACCAR competes in the Australian medium and heavy truck markets with Kenworth conventional and certain DAF COE models assembled at its facility at Bayswater in the state of Victoria, Australia, and DAF COE models primarily assembled in the U.K. Commercial truck manufacturing comprises the largest segment of PACCAR’s business and accounted for 78% of total 2019 net sales and revenues. 

Substantially all trucks are sold to independent dealers. The Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates are marketed and distributed by separate divisions in the U.S. and a foreign subsidiary in Canada. The Kenworth nameplate is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Mexico and Australia. The DAF nameplate is marketed and distributed worldwide by a foreign subsidiary headquartered in the Netherlands and is also marketed and distributed by foreign subsidiaries in Brasil and Australia. The decision to operate as a subsidiary or as a division is incidental to PACCAR’s Truck segment operations and reflects legal, tax and regulatory requirements in the various countries where PACCAR operates. 

The Truck segment utilizes centrally managed purchasing, information technology, technical research and testing, treasury and finance functions. Some manufacturing plants in North America produce trucks for more than one nameplate, while other plants produce trucks for only one nameplate, depending on various factors. Best manufacturing practices within the Company are shared on a routine basis reflecting the similarity of the business models employed by each nameplate. 

3

The Company’s trucks have a reputation for high quality products, most of which are ordered by dealers according to customer specifications. Some units are ordered by dealers for stocking to meet the needs of certain customers who require immediate delivery or for customers that require chassis to be fitted with specialized bodies. For a significant portion of the Company’s truck operations, major components, such as engines, transmissions and axles, as well as a substantial percentage of other components, are purchased from component manufacturers pursuant to PACCAR and customer specifications. DAF, which is more vertically integrated, manufactures PACCAR engines and axles and a higher percentage of other components for its heavy truck models. The Company also manufactures engines at its Columbus, Mississippi facility. In 2019, the Company installed PACCAR engines in 43% of the Company’s Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy

‑duty trucks in the U.S. and Canada and substantially all of the DAF heavy-duty trucks sold throughout the world. Engines not manufactured by the Company are purchased from Cummins Inc. (Cummins). The Company purchased a significant portion of its transmissions from Eaton Corporation Plc. (Eaton) and ZF Friedrichshafen AG (ZF). The Company also purchased a significant portion of North America stampings used for cabs from Magna International Inc. (Magna). The Company has long-term agreements with Cummins, Eaton, ZF and Magna to provide for continuity of supply. A loss of supply from Cummins, Eaton, ZF or Magna, and the resulting interruption in the production of trucks, would have a material effect on the Company’s results. Purchased materials and parts include raw materials, partially processed materials, such as castings, and finished components manufactured by independent suppliers. Raw materials, partially processed materials and finished components make up approximately 85% of the cost of new trucks. The value of major finished truck components manufactured by independent suppliers ranges from approximately 33% in Europe to approximately 86% in North America. In addition to materials, the Company’s cost of sales includes labor and factory overhead, vehicle delivery and warranty. Accordingly, except for certain factory overhead costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utilities, the Company’s cost of sales are highly correlated to sales. 

The Company’s DAF subsidiary purchases fully assembled cabs from a competitor, Renault
V.I., for its European light-duty product line pursuant to a joint product development and long-term supply contract. Sales of trucks manufactured with these cabs amounted to approximately 3% of consolidated revenues in 2019. A short-term loss of supply, and the resulting interruption in the production of these trucks, would not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. However, a loss of supply for an extended period of time would require the Company to either contract for an alternative source of supply or to manufacture cabs itself. 

Other than these components, the Company is not limited to any single source for any significant component, although the sudden inability of a supplier to deliver components could have a temporary adverse effect on production of certain products. Manufacturing inventory levels are based upon production schedules, and orders are placed with suppliers accordingly. 

Key factors affecting Truck segment earnings include the number of new trucks sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. The Company’s sales of new trucks are dependent on the size of the truck markets served and the Company’s share of those markets. Truck segment sales and margins tend to be cyclical based on the level of overall economic activity, the availability of capital and the amount of freight being transported. The Company’s costs for trucks consist primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the unit cost of purchased materials and finished components. The Company’s spending on research and development varies based on product development cycles and government requirements such as changes to diesel engine emissions and vehicle fuel efficiency standards in the various markets served. The Company maintains rigorous control of selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and seeks to minimize such costs. 

There are four principal competitors in the U.S. and Canada commercial truck market. The Company’s share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 market was 30.0% of retail sales in 2019, and the Company’s medium-duty market share was 16.9%. In Europe, there are six principal competitors in the commercial truck market, including parent companies to two competitors of the Company in the U.S. In 2019, DAF had a 16.2% share of the European heavy-duty market and a 9.7% share of the light/medium market. These markets are highly competitive in price, quality and service. PACCAR is not dependent on any single customer for its sales. There are no significant seasonal variations in sales.

The Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF nameplates are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of the Company’s truck products. The Company engages in a continuous program of trademark and trade name protection in all marketing areas of the world. 

The Company’s truck products are subject to noise, emission and safety regulations. Competing manufacturers are subject to the same regulations. The Company believes the cost of complying with these regulations will not be detrimental to its business. 

The Company had a total production backlog of $6.3 billion at the end of 2019. Within this backlog, orders scheduled for delivery within three
months (90
days) are considered to be firm. The
90‑day backlog approximated $3.3
billion at December
31,
2019, $4.5
billion at December
31,
2018 and $4.0 billion at December
31,
2017. Production of the year-end 2019 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2020.

PARTS

The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles to over 2,200 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers in 99 countries around the world. Aftermarket truck parts are sold and delivered to the Company’s independent dealers through the Company’s 18 strategically located parts distribution centers (PDCs) in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Mexico and Central and South America. Parts are primarily purchased from various suppliers and also manufactured by the Company. Aftermarket parts inventory levels are determined largely by anticipated customer demand and the need for timely delivery. The Parts segment accounted for 16% of total 2019 net sales and revenues.

Key factors affecting Parts segment earnings include the aftermarket parts sold in the markets served and the margins realized on the sales. Aftermarket parts sales are influenced by the total number of the Company’s trucks in service and the average age and mileage of those trucks. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain factory overhead, research and development, engineering and SG&A expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The Company’s cost for parts sold consists primarily of material costs, which are influenced by the price of commodities such as steel, copper, aluminum and petroleum. The Company utilizes long-term supply agreements to reduce the variability of the cost of parts sold. The Company maintains rigorous control of SG&A expenses and seeks to minimize such costs. 

FINANCIAL SERVICES 

PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) operates in 25 countries in North America, Europe, Australia and South America through wholly owned finance companies operating under the PACCAR Financial trade name. PFS also conducts full service leasing operations through operating divisions or wholly owned subsidiaries in North America, Germany and Australia under the PacLease trade name. Selected dealers in North America are franchised to provide full service leasing. PFS provides its franchisees with equipment financing and administrative support. PFS also operates its own full service lease outlets. PFS’s retail loan and lease customers consist of small, medium and large commercial trucking companies, independent owner/operators and other businesses and acquire their PACCAR trucks principally from independent PACCAR dealers. PFS accounted for 6% of total net sales and revenues and 57% of total assets in 2019.

PFS is primarily responsible for managing the sales of the Company’s used trucks. The Company’s Financial Services segment sells used trucks returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business and trucks acquired from repossessions. PFS also obtains used trucks from the Truck segment in trades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs). Certain gains and losses from the sale of used trucks are shared with the Truck segment. The Company’s Financial Services segment records revenue on the sale of used trucks received in trade and RVG returns.

The Company’s finance receivables are classified as dealer wholesale, dealer retail and customer retail segments. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to independent PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises, which use the proceeds to fund their customers’ acquisition of trucks and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for their acquisition of trucks and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated by fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customers operating more than five trucks. All others are considered owner/operators. Similar methods are employed to assess and monitor credit risk for each class.

Finance receivables are secured by the trucks and related equipment being financed or leased. The terms of loan and lease contracts generally range from three to five years depending on the type and use of equipment. Payment is required on dealer inventory financing when the floored truck is sold to a customer or upon maturity of the flooring loan, whichever comes first. Dealer inventory loans generally mature within one year. 

The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in public and private offerings and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies. PFS matches the maturity and interest rate characteristics of its debt with the maturity and interest rate characteristics of loans and leases. 

Key factors affecting the earnings of the Financial Services segment include the volume of new loans and leases, the yield earned on the loans and leases, the costs of funding investments in loans and leases and the ability to collect the amounts owed to PFS. New loan and lease volume is dependent on the volume of new trucks sold by Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF and the share of those truck sales that are financed by the Financial Services segment. The Company’s Financial Services market share is influenced by the extent of competition in the financing market. PFS’s primary competitors include commercial banks and independent finance and leasing companies. 

5

The revenue earned on loans and leases depends on market interest and lease rates and the ability of PFS to differentiate itself from the competition by superior industry knowledge and customer service. Dealer inventory loans have variable rates with rates reset monthly based on an index pertaining to the applicable local market. Retail loan and lease contracts normally have fixed rates over the contract term. PFS obtains funds either through fixed rate borrowings or through variable rate borrowings, a portion of which have been effectively converted to fixed rate through the use of interest-rate contracts. This enables PFS to obtain a stable spread between the cost of borrowing and the yield on fixed rate contracts over the contract term. Included in Financial Services cost of revenues is depreciation on equipment on operating leases. The amount of depreciation on operating leases principally depends on the acquisition cost of leased equipment, the term of the leases, which generally ranges from three to five years, and the residual value of the leases, which generally ranges from 30% to 70%. The margin earned is the difference between the revenues on loan and lease contracts and the direct costs of operation, including interest and depreciation. 

PFS incurs credit losses when customers are unable to pay the full amounts due under loan and finance lease contracts. PFS takes a conservative approach to underwriting new retail business in order to minimize credit losses.

The ability of customers to pay their obligations to PFS depends on the state of the general economy, the extent of freight demand, freight rates and the cost of fuel, among other factors. PFS limits its exposure to any one customer, with no one customer or dealer balance representing over 5% of the aggregate portfolio assets. PFS generally requires a down payment and secures its interest in the underlying truck collateral and may require other collateral or guarantees. In the event of default, PFS will repossess the truck and sell it in the open market primarily through its dealer network as well as PFS used truck centers. PFS will also seek to recover any shortfall between the amounts owed and the amounts recovered from sale of the collateral. The amount of credit losses depends on the rate of default on loans and finance leases and, in the event of repossession, the ability to recover the amount owed from sale of the collateral which is affected by used truck prices. PFS’s experience over the last fifty years financing truck sales has been that periods of economic weakness result in higher past dues and increased rates of repossession. Used truck prices also tend to fall during periods of economic weakness. As a result, credit losses tend to increase during periods of economic weakness. PFS provides an allowance for credit losses based on specifically identified customer risks and an analysis of estimated losses inherent in the portfolio, considering the amount of past due accounts, the trends of used truck prices and the economic environment in each of its markets.

Financial Services SG&A expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with originating and servicing the loan and lease portfolios. These costs vary somewhat depending on overall levels of business activity, but given the ongoing nature of servicing activities, tend to be relatively stable.

OTHER BUSINESSES 

Other businesses include the manufacturing of industrial winches in two U.S. plants and marketing them under the Braden, Carco and Gearmatic nameplates. The markets for these products are highly competitive, and the Company competes with a number of well established firms. Sales of industrial winches were less than 1% of total net sales and revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

The Braden, Carco and Gearmatic trademarks and trade names are recognized internationally and play an important role in the marketing of those products. 

PATENTS

The Company owns numerous patents which relate to all product lines. Although these patents are considered important to the overall conduct of the Company’s business, no patent or group of patents is considered essential to a material part of the Company’s business.

REGULATION

As a manufacturer of highway trucks, the Company is subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well as environmental laws and regulations in the United States, and is subject to similar regulations in all countries where it has operations and where its trucks are distributed. In addition, the Company is subject to certain other licensing requirements to do business in the United States and Europe. The Company believes it is in compliance with laws and regulations applicable to safety standards, the environment and other licensing requirements in all countries where it has operations and where its trucks are distributed.

Information regarding the effects that compliance with international, federal, state and local provisions regulating the environment have on the Company’s capital and operating expenditures and the Company’s involvement in environmental cleanup activities is included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Items
7 and 8, respectively.

[TABLE]

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

[/TABLE]

The following are significant risks which could have a material negative impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Business and Industry Risks

Commercial Truck Market Demand is Variable
. The Company’s business is highly sensitive to global and national economic conditions as well as economic conditions in the industries and markets it serves. Negative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for the Company’s equipment and services. The yearly demand for commercial vehicles may increase or decrease more than overall gross domestic product in markets the Company serves, which are principally North America and Europe. Demand for commercial vehicles may also be affected by the introduction of new vehicles and technologies by the Company or its competitors. 

Competition and Prices.
 The Company operates in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect the Company’s sales and pricing.

Financial results depend largely on the ability to develop, manufacture and market competitive products that profitably meet customer demand.

Production Costs and Supplier Capacity.
 The Company’s products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Commodity or component price increases and significant shortages of component products may adversely impact the Company’s financial results or use of its production capacity. 

Many of the Company’s suppliers also supply automotive manufacturers, and factors that adversely affect the automotive industry can also have adverse effects on these suppliers and the Company. Supplier delivery performance can be adversely affected if increased demand for these suppliers’ products exceeds their production capacity. 

Unexpected events, including natural disasters, may increase the Company’s cost of doing business or disrupt the Company’s or its suppliers’ operations.

The recent outbreak of the Coronavirus “COVID-19” in China has resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers in China that are part of the Company’s supply chain. As of February 19, 2020, the Company has not experienced shortages in supply as a result of the interruptions, but if the work stoppages were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be resulting supply shortages which could impact the Company’s ability to deliver trucks and parts to customers on schedule and have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and profits.

Liquidity Risks, Credit Ratings and Costs of Funds. 
Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit the Company’s sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of customers, dealers and suppliers. A lowering of the Company’s credit ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and adversely affect access to capital markets. 

The Company’s Financial Services segment obtains funds for its operations from commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt. If the markets for commercial paper, medium-term notes and bank debt do not provide the necessary liquidity in the future, the Financial Services segment may experience increased costs or may have to limit its financing of retail and wholesale assets. This could result in a reduction of the number of vehicles the Company is able to produce and sell to customers. 

The Financial Services Industry is Highly Competitive. 
The Company’s Financial Services segment competes with banks, other commercial finance companies and financial services firms which may have lower costs of borrowing, higher leverage or market share goals that result in a willingness to offer lower interest rates, which may lead to decreased margins, lower market share or both. A decline in the Company’s truck unit sales and a decrease in truck residual values and used truck inventory values due to lower used truck pricing are also factors which may affect the Company’s Financial Services segment.

The Financial Services Segment is Subject to Credit Risk.
 The Financial Services segment is exposed to the risk of loss arising from the failure of a customer, dealer or counterparty to meet the terms of the loans, leases and derivative contracts with the Company. 

7

Although the financial assets of the Financial Services segment are secured by underlying equipment collateral, in the event a customer cannot meet its obligations to the Company, there is a risk that the value of the underlying collateral will not be sufficient to recover the amounts owed to the Company, resulting in credit losses. 

Interest-Rate Risks. 
The 

Financial Services segment 

is subject to interest-rate risks, because increases in interest rates can reduce demand for its products, increase borrowing costs and potentially reduce interest margins.

PFS uses derivative contracts to match the interest rate characteristics of its debt to the interest rate characteristics of its finance receivables in order to mitigate the risk of 

changing interest rates.

Information Technology.
 The Company relies on information technology systems and networks to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of its business processes and activities. These computer systems and networks may be subject to disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; or outside parties attempting to disrupt the Company’s business or gain unauthorized access to the Company’s electronic data. The Company maintains and continues to invest in protections to guard against such events. Examples of these protections include conducting third-party penetration tests, implementing software detection and prevention tools, event monitoring, and disaster recoverability. Additionally the Company maintains a cybersecurity insurance policy. Despite these safeguards, there remains a risk of system disruptions, unauthorized access and data loss. 

If the Company’s computer systems were to be damaged, disrupted or breached, it could impact data availability and integrity, result in a theft of the Company’s intellectual property or lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information of the Company’s customers, suppliers and employees. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations and governmental proceedings. These events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, damage its reputation, disrupt operations and negatively impact competitiveness in the marketplace.

Political, Regulatory and Economic Risks

Multinational Operations
. The Company’s global operations are exposed to political, economic and other risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which the Company operates.

 The Company may be adversely affected by political instabilities, fuel shortages or interruptions in utility or transportation systems, natural calamities, wars, terrorism and labor strikes.

Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and i

nternational trade policies may impact demand for the Company’s products, financial results and competitive position.

PACCAR’s global operations are subject to extensive trade, competition and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impose significant compliance costs. 

U.K. Exit from the European Union (EU)
. 

The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020. Under the withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the EU, there is a transition period that will last until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, all EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the U.K. During 2020, the U.K. and the EU intend to conclude new agreements concerning their future relationship. If no agreement is reached during the transition period, and there is no mutually agreed extension of the transition period, the standard trade protocols of the World Trade Organization (WTO) would become effective. 

The Company manufactures medium- and heavy-duty DAF trucks in the U.K. which are sold primarily in the U.K. and to a lesser extent in Europe and other world markets. In 2019, approximately 10% of the Company’s worldwide truck production was manufactured in the U.K. In the event standard trade protocols of the WTO become effective, it is anticipated there would be an increase in tariffs on truck components and parts from the EU which would increase the cost of all trucks and parts in the U.K. The higher cost of trucks and parts may impact truck and parts sales and margins which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations. The Company’s results could also be impacted by the uncertainty regarding timing and terms of the final agreement, which could cause delays in capital investment decisions.

LIBOR (London Inter-Bank Offered Rate) Transition.
 Certain financing provided by PFS to dealers and retail customers, as well as financing extended to PFS are based on variable interest rate contracts.
These contracts utilize various benchmark rates, including LIBOR, to establish applicable contract interest rates.
PACCAR also utilizes hedging instruments and has line of credit arrangements which reference LIBOR (including other similar benchmark rates).
In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021.
At this time it is not clear if LIBOR will continue to exist, and if not, what alternative benchmark rate will replace LIBOR.
Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact currently active contracts which terminate after 2021.

Substantially all of the Company’s contracts which reference LIBOR, including dealer wholesale financing contracts, medium-term notes, hedging instruments and line of credit arrangements, include fall-back language that specifies the methods to establish contract interest rates in the absence of LIBOR, or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate should LIBOR be discontinued.

8

The Company has retail loan and lease contracts with a current balance of
approximately $220 million, or less than 1.4% of PFS assets,
that extend beyond 2021 and do not contain fall-back language or provide for the use of an alternative benchmark rate.
The Company will seek to amend these contracts to allow for the use of an alternative benchmark rate.

Changes to benchmark rates will have an uncertain impact on finance receivables and other financial obligations, our current or future cost of funds and/or access to capital markets.
The Company will attempt to minimize the impact of differences between the current and replacement benchmark rates through pricing adjustments on the financing provided by PFS, but it is not certain the Company will be able to do so. Based on the current balance of contracts referencing LIBOR (including other similar benchmark rates), it is estimated that for a 10 basis point difference between the current and replacement benchmark rates that the Company is unable to recover through pricing adjustments, income before income taxes would decrease by approximately $2 million. Accordingly, the Company does not expect the anticipated changes to the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate will have a material impact on the results of operations.

Environmental Regulations. 
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations

that impose significant compliance costs.

The Company could experience higher research and development and manufacturing costs due to changes in government requirements for its products, including changes in emissions, fuel, greenhouse gas or other regulations.

Litigation, Product Liability and Regulatory.
 The Company’s products are subject to recall for environmental, performance and safety-related issues. Product recalls, lawsuits, regulatory actions or increases in the reserves the Company establishes for contingencies may increase the Company’s costs and lower profits. Due to the international nature of the Company’s business, some products are also subject to international trade regulations, including customs and import / export related laws and regulations, government embargoes and sanctions prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries, as well as anti-corruption laws. The Company’s reputation and its brand names are valuable assets, and claims or regulatory actions, even if unsuccessful or without merit, could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and brand images because of adverse publicity. 

Currency Exchange and Translation.
 The Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S.
dollars, while significant operations are denominated in the currencies of other countries.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations can affect the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations

 through both translation and transaction risk

, as reported in the Company’s financial statements. 

The Company uses certain derivative financial instruments and localized production of its products to reduce, but not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Accounting Estimates. 
In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. Certain of these estimates, judgments and assumptions, such as residual values on operating leases, the allowance for credit losses and product warranty are particularly sensitive. If actual results are different from estimates used by management, they may have a material impact on the financial statements. For additional disclosures regarding accounting estimates, see “Critical Accounting Policies” under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Taxes. 
Changes in statutory income tax rates in the countries in which the Company operates impact the Company’s effective tax rate. Changes to other taxes or the adoption of other new tax legislation could affect the Company’s provision for income taxes and related tax assets and liabilities.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

[/TABLE]

On July 19, 2016, the European Commission (EC) concluded its investigation of all major European truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with DAF. Following the settlement, claims and lawsuits have been filed against the Company, DAF and certain DAF subsidiaries and other truck manufacturers in various European jurisdictions. These claims and lawsuits include a number of collective proceedings, including proposed class actions in the United Kingdom, alleging EC-related claims and seeking unspecified damages.

Others may bring EC-related claims and lawsuits against the Company or its subsidiaries. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses, such claims and lawsuits will likely take a significant period of time to resolve. The Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result given the early stage of these claims and lawsuits. An adverse outcome of such proceedings could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of business. Management believes that the disposition of such lawsuits will not materially affect the Company's business or financial condition.

Stockholder Return Performance Graph.

The following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in the cumulative total stockholder return on the Company’s common stock, to the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s Composite 500 Stock Index and the return of the industry peer groups of companies identified in the graph (the “Peer Group Index”) for the last five fiscal years ended December 31, 2019. Standard & Poor’s has calculated a return for each company in the Peer Group Index weighted according to its respective capitalization at the beginning of each period with dividends reinvested on a monthly basis. Management believes that the identified companies and methodology used in the graph for the Peer Group Index provide a better comparison than other indices available. The Peer Group Index consists of AGCO Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Dana Incorporated, Deere & Company, Eaton Corporation, Meritor Inc., Navistar International Corporation, Oshkosh Corporation, AB Volvo and CNH Industrial N.V. The comparison assumes that $100 was invested December 31, 2014, in the Company’s common stock and in the stated indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES:

Item 6 of this Form 10-K includes “adjusted net income (non-GAAP)” and “adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP)”, which are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), since they exclude the one-time tax benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) in 2017 and the non-recurring European Commission charge in 2016. These measures differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Management utilizes these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s performance and believes these measures allow investors and management to evaluate operating trends by excluding significant non-recurring items that are not representative of underlying operating trends.

Reconciliations from the most directly comparable GAAP measures of adjusted net income (non-GAAP) and adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) are as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

[/TABLE]

OVERVIEW:

PACCAR is a global technology company whose Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks. In North America, trucks are sold under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates, in Europe, under the DAF nameplate and in Australia and South America, under the Kenworth and DAF nameplates. The Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles. The Company’s Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing PACCAR products in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company’s Other business includes the manufacturing and marketing of industrial winches.

2019 Financial Highlights

[TABLE]

•

Financial Services revenues were $1.48 billion in 2019 compared to $1.36 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher average earning asset balances and higher yields in North America.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Capital investments were $743.9 million in 2019 compared to $437.1 million in 2018 reflecting continued investments in the Company’s manufacturing facilities, new product development and enhanced aftermarket support.

[/TABLE]

PACCAR opened Global Embedded Software centers in Kirkland, Washington and Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which will accelerate embedded software development and connected vehicle solutions to benefit customers’ operating efficiency
. 

In January 2020, PACCAR exhibited three vehicles with autonomous and alternative powertrain technologies at the CES 2020 show in Las Vegas, Nevada: a level 4 autonomous Kenworth T680; a battery-electric Peterbilt Model 520EV; and a battery-electric Kenworth K270E. These trucks are designed for a range of customer applications, including over-the-road transportation, refuse collection and urban distribution.

Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF are field-testing battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid powertrain trucks with customers in North America and Europe. These customer field tests are providing excellent feedback on future truck technologies, which will support PACCAR’s environmental and engineering leadership with the development of innovative alternative powertrain technologies.

PACCAR continues to add global distribution capacity to deliver industry-leading aftermarket parts availability to customers. PACCAR will open a new 250,000 square-foot parts distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada and a new 160,000 square-foot parts distribution center in Ponta Grossa, Brasil in 2020 to enhance parts availability for customers.

PACCAR has been honored for the second consecutive year as a global leader in environmental practices by environmental reporting firm CDP, earning recognition on the 2019 
CDP Climate Change A List
. Over 8,000 companies disclosed data about their environmental impacts, risks and opportunities to CDP for independent assessment. PACCAR is one of only 35 companies in the U.S. earning a CDP score of “A” and is placed in the top 2% of reporting companies worldwide. 

The PACCAR Financial Services (PFS) group of companies has operations covering four continents and 25 countries. The global breadth of PFS and its rigorous credit application process support a portfolio of loans and leases with record total assets of $16.07 billion. PFS issued $2.49
 
billion in medium-term notes during 2019 to support portfolio growth and repay maturing debt.

Truck Outlook

Heavy-duty truck industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada in 2020 are expected to decrease to 230,000 to 260,000 units compared to 308,800 in 2019. In Europe, the 2020 truck industry registrations for over 16-tonne vehicles are expected to be 260,000 to 290,000 units compared to 320,200 in 2019. In South America, heavy-duty truck industry sales in 2020 are estimated to be 100,000 to 110,000 units compared to 105,000 units in 2019.

Parts Outlook

In 2020, PACCAR Parts sales are expected to grow 4-6% compared to 2019. 

Financial Services Outlook

Based on the truck market outlook, average earning assets in 2020 are expected to remain similar to 2019 levels. Current strong levels of freight tonnage are contributing to customers’ profitability and cash flow. If current freight transportation conditions decline due to weaker economic conditions, then past due accounts, truck repossessions and credit losses would likely increase from the current low levels and new business volume would likely decline. 

Capital Spending and R&D Outlook

Capital investments in 2020 are expected to be $625 to $675 million, and R&D is expected to be $310 to $340 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in aerodynamic truck models, integrated powertrains including diesel, electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, advanced driver assistance systems, digital services and next-generation manufacturing and distribution capabilities.

See the Forward-Looking Statements section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis for factors that may affect these outlooks.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS:

The Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented below. For information on the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to Part II, Item 7 in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The following provides an analysis of the results of operations for the Company’s three reportable segments - Truck, Parts and Financial Services. Where possible, the Company has quantified the impact of factors identified in the following discussion and analysis. In cases where it is not possible to quantify the impact of factors, the Company lists them in estimated order of importance. Factors for which the Company is unable to specifically quantify the impact include market demand, fuel prices, freight tonnage and economic conditions affecting the Company’s results of operations.

2019 Compared to 2018:

Truck

The Company’s Truck segment accounted for 78% of revenues in 2019 compared to 77% in 2018.

The Company’s new truck deliveries are summarized below:

In 2019, industry retail sales in the heavy-duty market in the U.S. and Canada increased to 308,800 units from 284,800 units in 2018. The Company’s heavy-duty truck retail market share was 30.0% in 2019 compared to 29.4% in 2018. The medium-duty market was 
108,100 units 
in 2019 compared to 98,100 units in 2018. The Company’s medium-duty market 
share was 16.9% in 
2019 compared to 17.7% in 2018. 

16

The over 16

‑tonne truck market in Europe in 2019 increased to 320,200 units from 318,800 units in 2018, and DAF’s market share was 16.2% in 2019 compared to 16.6% in 2018. The 6 to 16

‑tonne market in 2019 increased to 53,600 units from 51,900 units in 2018. DAF’s market share in the 6 to 16-tonne market in 2019 was 9.7% compared to 9.0% in 2018.

The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues are summarized below:

The Company’s worldwide truck net sales and revenues increased to $19.99 billion in 2019 from $18.19 billion in 2018, primarily due to higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada and Latin America, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects. Truck segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues increased in 2019, reflecting higher truck unit deliveries and higher gross margins. 

The major factors for the Truck segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

[TABLE]

•

Truck sales volume primarily reflects higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada ($1,414.4 million sales and $1,180.0 million cost of sales). In Europe, the impact of lower truck unit deliveries was more than offset by a decrease in units accounted for as operating leases, resulting in higher sales ($236.8 million) and cost of sales ($217.9 million). 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average truck sales prices increased

sales by $489.8

million, primarily due to higher price realization in North America.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average cost per truck increased

cost of sales by $297.8 million, primarily reflecting higher material and labor costs.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Factory overhead and other indirect costs increased

$65.2 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher supplies and maintenance costs to support increased truck production.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Extended warranties, operating leases and other revenues increased

by $71.9 million primarily due to a higher volume of repair and maintenance (R&M) and extended warranty contracts, as well as higher revenues from operating leases. Cost of sales and revenues increased by $101.9 million primarily due to higher impairments and losses on used trucks and higher costs of extended warranty and R&M contracts.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales reflects a decline

in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro.

[/TABLE]

17

Truck selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) for 2019 increased to $269.7 million from $248.3 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher professional fees ($24.4 million) and higher salaries and related expenses ($6.8 million), partially offset by favorable currency translation effects ($9.7 million). As a percentage of sales, Truck SG&A decreased to 1.3% in 2019 from 1.4% in 2018 due to higher net sales.

Parts

The Company’s Parts segment accounted for 16% of revenues in 2019 and 2018.

The Company’s worldwide parts net sales and revenues increased to a record $4.02 billion in 2019 from $3.84 billion in 2018, due to higher aftermarket demand in U.S. and Canada. The increase in Parts segment income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues in 2019 was primarily due to higher sales volume and higher price realization, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.

The major factors for the Parts segment changes in net sales and revenues, cost of sales and revenues and gross margin between 2019 and 2018 are as follows:

[TABLE]

•

Aftermarket parts sales volume increased

by $75.4 million and related cost of sales increased by $51.1 million due to higher demand in all markets.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average aftermarket parts sales prices increased sales by $173.9 million primarily due to higher price realization in the U.S. and Canada. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average aftermarket parts direct costs increased $85.5 million due to higher material costs.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Warehouse and other indirect costs increased $17.6 million, primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and higher depreciation expense. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

The currency translation effect on sales and cost of sales primarily reflects a decline in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro. 

[/TABLE]

Parts SG&A expense for 2019 was $207.8 million compared to $206.2 million in 2018 primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses, partially offset by lower sales and marketing costs and favorable currency translation effects. As a percentage of sales, Parts SG&A decreased to 5.2% in 2019 from 5.4% in 2018, primarily due to higher net sales.

18

Financial Services

The Company’s Financial Services segment accounted for 6% of revenues in 2019 and 2018.

New loan and lease volume was a record $5.63 billion in 2019 compared to $5.23 billion in 2018, primarily reflecting higher truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada. PFS finance market share of new PACCAR truck sales was 24.5% in 2019 compared to 23.9% in 2018. 

PFS revenues increased to $1.48 billion in 2019 from $1.36 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to revenue on higher average earning assets and higher portfolio yields reflecting higher market interest rates in North America, and higher used truck sales volume in Europe, partially offset by the effects of translating weaker foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar. The effects of currency translation decreased PFS revenues by $26.7 million in 2019, primarily due to changes in the euro.

PFS income before income taxes decreased to $298.9 million in 2019 from $305.9 million in 2018, primarily due to lower results on returned lease assets and higher SG&A expenses as $12.0 million of certain initial direct costs were immediately expensed in 2019 with the adoption of the new lease standard, partially offset by higher average earning assets balances. Currency exchange effects decreased PFS income before taxes by $3.2 million in 2019. 

19

Included in Financial Services “Other Assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are used trucks held for sale, net of impairments, of $391.4 million at December 31, 2019 and $226.4 million at December 31, 2018. These trucks are primarily units returned from matured operating leases in the ordinary course of business, and also include trucks acquire

d from repossessions, through 

acquisitions of used trucks in tr

ades related to new truck sales and trucks returned from residual value guarantees (RVGs).

The Company recognized losses on used trucks, excluding repossessions, of $57.5 million in 2019 compared to $35.4 million in 2018, including losses on multiple unit transactions of $19.1 million in 2019 compared to $20.2 million in 2018. Used truck losses related to repossessions, which are recognized as credit losses, were not significant for 2019 or 2018.

The major factors for the changes in interest and fees, interest and other borrowing expenses and finance margin between 2019 and 2018 are outlined below:

[TABLE]

•

Average finance receivables increased

$1,452.5 million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2019 as a result of retail portfolio new business volume exceeding collections and higher dealer wholesale balances.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average debt balances increased

$1,456.1

million (excluding foreign exchange effects) in 2019. The higher average debt balances reflect funding for a higher average earning assets portfolio, which includes loans, finance leases, wholesale receivables and equipment on operating lease.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Higher portfolio yields (5.2% in 2019 compared to 5.0% in 2018) increased interest and fees by $16.6 million. The higher portfolio yields were primarily due to higher market rates in North America. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

The currency translation effects reflect a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, the Australian and Canadian dollars and the British pound.

[/TABLE]

The following table summarizes operating lease, rental and other revenues and depreciation and other expenses:

20

The major factors for the changes in operating lease, rental and other revenues, depreciation and other expenses and lease margin between 2019 and 2018 are outlined below: 

[TABLE]

•

A higher sales volume of used trucks received on trade increased operating lease, rental and other revenues by $32.3 million and increased depreciation and other expenses by $31.1 million. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Results on returned lease assets increased

depreciation and other expenses by $28.9 million primarily due to higher losses on sales of returned lease units in Europe. 

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Average operating lease assets increased $173.2 million (excluding foreign exchange effects), which increased revenues by $34.7 million and related depreciation and other expenses by $30.0 million.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Revenue per asset decreased

$11.2

million primarily due to lower rental income and lower fleet utilization. Cost per asset decreased $.9 million due to lower depreciation expense and lower vehicle related expenses, partially offset by higher operating lease impairments in Europe.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

The currency translation effects reflect a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro. 

[/TABLE]

Financial Services SG&A expense increased to $137.0 million in 2019 from $119.8 million in 2018. The increase was due to higher salaries and related expenses to support portfolio growth and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard under which $12.0 million of certain initial direct costs were immediately expensed. In prior years, these costs were capitalized and amortized to expense over the lease term. As a percentage of revenues, Financial Services SG&A increased to 9.3% in 2019 from 8.8% in 2018.

The following table summarizes the provision for losses on receivables and net charge-offs: 

The provision for losses on receivables was $15.4 million in 2019 compared to $16.5 million in 2018, reflecting continued good portfolio performance. The decrease in provision for losses was primarily driven by higher recoveries on charged-off accounts in Europe.

The Company modifies loans and finance leases as a normal part of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness 

21

of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).

The post-modification balance of accounts modified during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized below:

[TABLE]

*

Recorded investment immediately after modification as a percentage of the year-end retail portfolio balance.

[/TABLE]

In 2019, total modification activity increased compared to 2018 due to higher modifications for commercial reasons and insignificant delay, partially offset by lower modifications for credit - no concession and credit - TDR. The increase in modifications for commercial reasons primarily reflects higher volumes of refinancing. The increase in modifications for insignificant delay reflects more fleet customers requesting payment relief for up to three months. The decrease in modifications for credit - no concession is primarily due to lower volumes of refinancing in Europe for customers in financial difficulty. Credit - TDR modifications 
decreased to $2.5 million in 2019 from $13.1 million in 2018 as there were no large fleet modifications in 2019 compared to modifications for two fleet customers in 2018.

The following table summarizes the Company’s 30+
days past due accounts:

Accounts 30+
days past
due increased slightly to .7% at December 31, 2019 from .4% at December 31, 2018, and remain at low levels. The Company continues to focus on maintaining low past due balances.

When the Company modifies a 30+
days past due account, the customer is then generally considered current under the revised contractual terms. The Company modified $1.7
 
million and $7.2 million of accounts worldwide during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, respectively, which were 30+ days past due and became current at the time of modification. Had these accounts not been modified and continued to not make payments, the pro forma percentage of retail loan and lease accounts 30+
days past due would have been as follows:

Modifications of accounts in prior quarters that were more than 30 days past due at the time of modification are included in past dues if they were not performing under the modified terms at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The effect on the allowance for credit losses from such modifications was not significant at December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

The Company’s 2019 and 2018 annualized pre-tax return on average assets for Financial Services was 2.0% and 2.2%, respectively. 

22

Other 

Other includes the winch business as well as sales, income and expenses not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expense. Other sales represent less than 1% of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2019 and 2018. Other SG&A increased to $84.0 million in 2019 from $70.4 million in 2018 primarily due to higher compensation costs. 

Other (loss) income before tax was $(17.7) million in 2019 compared to $2.7 million in 2018. The loss in 2019 compared to income in 2018 was primarily due to higher compensation costs, lower results from the winch business and higher expected costs to resolve certain environmental matters.

Investment income increased to $82.3 million in 2019 from $60.9 million in 2018, primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and higher yields on U.S. investments due to higher market interest rates. 

Income Taxes

In 2019, the effective tax rate was 23.0% compared to 21.9% in 2018. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2018 benefitted from a one-time reduction in tax liability related to extended warranty contracts.

In 2019, domestic income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues improved primarily due to higher revenues from truck operations. The decrease in foreign income before income taxes and pre-tax return on revenues was primarily due to lower truck and finance results in Europe and lower truck volumes in Australia.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES:

The Company’s total cash and marketable debt securities at December 31, 2019 increased $880.9 million from the balances at December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents.

23

The change in cash and cash equivalents is summarized below:

Operating activities
: Cash provided by operations decreased by $132.0 million to $2.86 billion in 2019 from $2.99 billion in 2018. The decrease in operating cash flows reflects lower cash inflows of $556.5 million from accounts payable and accrued expenses, as payments for goods and services exceeded purchases by $27.6 million in 2019 compared to purchases of goods and services exceeding payments by $528.9 million in 2018. Additionally, lower operating cash flows reflect a reduction in liabilities for RVGs and deferred revenues of $454.7 million, primarily due to a lower volume of new RVG contracts accounted for as operating leases in 2019 compared to 2018. The lower cash inflows were partially offset by higher cash inflow of $357.3 million from inventories as there were $24.6 million in net inventory reductions in 2019 versus $332.7 million in net purchases in 2018. There was a $226.8 million increase from accounts receivable as sales of goods and services exceeding cash receipts were lower in 2019 compared to 2018. In addition, there was a higher net income of $192.8 million and an increase of $140.3 million from income taxes, primarily due to lower tax payments in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Investing activities: 
Cash used in investing activities increased by $276.7 million to $2.21 billion in 2019 from $1.93 billion in 2018. Higher net cash used in investing activities reflects $450.7 million for marketable debt securities as there were $135.1 million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in 2019 compared to $315.6 million in net proceeds from sales of marketable debt securities in 2018. Payments for property, plant and equipment increased by $116.4 million. This was partially offset by lower net originations from retail loans and finance leases of $251.9 million and fewer acquisitions of equipment on operating leases of $97.9 million.

Financing activities: 
Cash provided by financing activities was $83.4 million in 2019, $12.3 million higher than the $71.1 million provided in 2018. In 2019, the Company issued $2.50 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.79 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $557.1 million. In 2018, the Company issued $2.34 billion of term debt, repaid term debt of $1.76 billion and increased its outstanding commercial paper and short-term bank loans by $625.9 million. This resulted in cash provided by borrowing activities of $1.27 billion in 2019, $60.9 million higher than the cash provided by borrowing activities of $1.21 billion in 2018. The Company paid $1.14 billion in dividends in 2019, $334.3 million higher than the $804.3 million paid in 2018 due primarily to a higher extra dividend paid in January 2019.

In addition, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $110.2 million in 2019 compared to the purchase of 5.8 million shares for $354.4 million in 2018.

Credit Lines and Other:

The Company has line of credit arrangements of $3.58 billion, of which $3.27 billion were unused at December 31, 2019. Included in these arrangements are $3.00 billion of committed bank facilities, of which $1.00 billion expires in June
2020, $1.00 billion expires in June
2023 and $1.00
billion expires in June
2024. The Company intends to extend or replace these credit facilities on or before expiration to maintain facilities of similar amounts and duration. These credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for commercial paper borrowings and maturing medium-term notes. There were no borrowings under the committed bank facilities for the year ended December 31, 2019.

24

On July 9, 2018, PACCAR’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to $300.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, and on December 4, 2018, approved a plan to repurchase an additional $500.0 million of common stock upon completion of the prior plan. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company completed the repurchase of $300.0 million of the Company’s common stock under the authorization approved on July 9, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has repurchased $69.5 million of shares under the December 4, 2018 authorization.

Truck, Parts and Other

The Company provides funding for working capital, capital expenditures, R&D, dividends, stock repurchases and other business initiatives and commitments primarily from cash provided by operations. Management expects this method of funding to continue in the future.

Over the past decade, the Company’s combined investments in worldwide capital projects and R&D totaled $6.77 billion, and have significantly increased the operating capacity and efficiency of its facilities and enhanced the quality and operating efficiency of the Company’s premium products. 

Capital investments in 2020 are expected to be $625 to $675 million, and R&D is expected to be $310 to $340 million. The Company is investing for long-term growth in aerodynamic truck models, integrated powertrains including diesel, electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, advanced driver assistance systems, digital services and next-generation manufacturing and distribution capabilities.

The Company conducts business in certain countries which have been experiencing or may experience significant financial stress, fiscal or political strain and are subject to the corresponding potential for default. The Company routinely monitors its financial exposure to global financial conditions, global counterparties and operating environments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s exposures in such countries were insignificant.

Financial Services

The Company funds its financial services activities primarily from collections on existing finance receivables and borrowings in the capital markets. The primary sources of borrowings in the capital markets are commercial paper and medium-term notes issued in the public markets and, to a lesser extent, bank loans. An additional source of funds is loans from other PACCAR companies.

In November 2018, the Company’s U.S. finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Corp. (PFC), filed a shelf registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFC as of December 31, 2019 was $5.55 billion. In February 2020, PFC issued $300.0 million of medium-term notes under this registration. The registration expires in November 2021 and does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued during that period.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s European finance subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Europe, had €1.35 billion available for issuance under a €2.50 billion medium-term note program listed on the Professional Securities Market of the London Stock Exchange. This program replaced an expiring program in the second quarter of 2019 and is renewable annually through the filing of a new listing. 

In April 2016, PACCAR Financial Mexico registered a 10.00 billion peso medium-term note and commercial paper program with the Comision Nacional Bancaria y de Valores. The registration expires in April 2021 and limits the amount of commercial paper (up to one year) to 5.00 billion pesos. At December 31, 2019, 6.80 billion pesos were available for issuance. 

In August 2018, the Company’s Australian subsidiary, PACCAR Financial Pty. Ltd. (PFPL), registered a medium-term note program. The program does not limit the principal amount of debt securities that may be issued under the program. The total amount of medium-term notes outstanding for PFPL as of December 31, 2019 was 300.0 million Australian dollars.

The Company believes its cash balances and investments, collections on existing finance receivables, committed bank facilities, and current investment-grade credit ratings of A+/A1 will continue to provide it with sufficient resources and access to capital markets at competitive interest rates and therefore contribute to the Company maintaining its liquidity and financial stability. In the event of a decrease in the Company’s credit ratings or a disruption in the financial markets, the Company may not be able to refinance its maturing debt in the financial markets. In such circumstances, the Company would be exposed to liquidity risk to the degree that the timing of debt maturities differs from the timing of receivable collections from customers. The Company believes its various sources of liquidity, including committed bank facilities, would continue to provide it with sufficient funding resources to service its maturing debt obligations.

[TABLE]

**

Interest on floating-rate debt is based on the applicable market rates at December 31, 2019.

[/TABLE]

Total cash commitments for borrowings and interest on term debt were $11.57 billion and were related to the Financial Services segment. As described in Note J of the consolidated financial statements, borrowings consist primarily of term notes and commercial paper issued by the Financial Services segment. The Company expects to fund its maturing Financial Services debt obligations principally from funds provided by collections from customers on loans and lease contracts, as well as from the proceeds of commercial paper and medium-term note borrowings. Purchase obligations are the Company’s contractual commitments to acquire future production inventory and capital equipment. Other obligations primarily include commitments to purchase energy. 

The Company’s other commitments include the following at December 31, 2019:

Loan and lease commitments are for funding new retail loan and lease contracts. Residual value guarantees represent the Company’s commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value if the customer decides to return the truck at a specified date in the future. 

IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS:

The Company, its competitors and industry in general are subject to various domestic and foreign requirements relating to the environment. The Company believes its policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and that its handling, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances have been in accordance with environmental laws and regulations in effect at the time such use and disposal occurred. 

The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.

26

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements. In the preparation of the Company’s financial statements, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, management uses estimates and makes judgments and assumptions that affect asset and liability values and the amounts reported as income and expense during the periods presented. The following are accounting policies which, in the opinion of management, are particularly sensitive and which, if actual results are different from estimates used by management, may have a material impact on the financial statements. 

Operating Leases

Trucks sold pursuant to agreements accounted for as operating leases are disclosed in Note F of the consolidated financial statements. In determining its estimate of the residual value of such vehicles, the Company considers the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. Operating lease terms generally range from three to five years. The resulting residual values on operating leases generally range between 30% and 70%
 
of the original equipment cost. If the sales price of a truck at the end of the term of the agreement differs from the Company’s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result. 

Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. A decrease in the estimated equipment residual values would increase annual depreciation expense over the remaining lease term. 

During 2019 and 2018, market values on equipment returning upon operating lease maturity were generally lower than the residual values on the equipment, resulting in an increase in depreciation expense of $109.0 million and $45.7 million, respectively. 

At December 31, 2019, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases in the Financial Services segment and residual value guarantee on trucks accounted for as operating leases in the Truck segment was $2.36 billion. A 10% decrease in used truck values worldwide, if expected to persist over the remaining maturities of the Company’s operating leases, would reduce residual value estimates and result in the Company recording an average of approximately $67 million of additional depreciation per year.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses related to the Company’s loans and finance leases is disclosed in Note E of the consolidated financial statements. The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over three to five years, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves. 

The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments.

Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company’s recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below. 

27

The Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. Information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio.

The adequacy of the allowance is evaluated quarterly based on the most recent past due account information and current market conditions. As accounts become past due, the likelihood that they will not be fully collected increases. The Company’s experience indicates the probability of not fully collecting past due accounts ranges between 30% and 70%. Over the past three years, the Company’s year-end 30+ days past due accounts have ranged between .4% and .7% of loan and lease receivables. Historically, a 100 basis point increase in the 30+ days past due percentage has resulted in an increase in credit losses of 2 to 35 basis points of receivables. At December 31, 2019, 30+ days past dues were .7%. If past dues were 100 basis points higher or 1.7% as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s estimate of credit losses would likely have increased by a range of $2 to $32 million depending on the extent of the past dues, the estimated value of the collateral as compared to amounts owed and general economic factors. 

Product Warranty

Product warranty is disclosed in Note I of the consolidated financial statements. The expenses related to product warranty are estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. Management takes actions to minimize warranty costs through quality-improvement programs; however, actual claim costs incurred could materially differ from the estimated amounts and require adjustments to the reserve. Historically those adjustments have not been material. Over the past two years, warranty expense as a percentage of Truck, Parts and Other net sales and revenues has ranged between 1.6% and 1.7%. If the 2019 warranty expense had been .2% higher as a percentage of net sales and revenues in 2019, warranty expense would have increased by approximately $48 million. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:

This report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking statements include statements relating to future results of operations or financial position and any other statement that does not relate to any historical or current fact. Such statements are based on currently available operating, financial and other information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may affect actual results. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: a significant decline in industry sales; competitive pressures; reduced market share; reduced availability of or higher prices for fuel; increased safety, emissions, or other regulations or tariffs resulting in higher costs and/or sales restrictions; currency or commodity price fluctuations; lower used truck prices; insufficient or under-utilization of manufacturing capacity; supplier interruptions; insufficient liquidity in the capital markets; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in the levels of the Financial Services segment new business volume due to unit fluctuations in new PACCAR truck sales or reduced market shares; changes affecting the profitability of truck owners and operators; price changes impacting truck sales prices and residual values; insufficient supplier capacity or access to raw materials; labor disruptions; shortages of commercial truck drivers; increased warranty costs; litigation, including EC settlement-related claims; or legislative and governmental regulations. A more detailed description of these and other risks is included under the heading Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Currencies are presented in millions for the market risks and derivative instruments sections below.

Interest-Rate Risks - 
See Note
P for a description of the Company’s hedging programs and exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 

The Company measures its interest-rate risk by estimating the amount by which the fair value of interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, would change assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase across the yield curve as shown in the following table:

Currency Risks - 
The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations of foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso 

(see Note P for additional information concerning these hedges)

. Based on the Company’s sensitivity analysis, the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a 10% unfavorable change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be a loss of $128.0 related to contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019, compared to a loss of $101.2 at December 31, 2018. These amounts would be largely offset by changes in the values of the underlying hedged exposures.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

[/TABLE]

Description of Operations:
 PACCAR Inc (the Company or PACCAR) is a multinational company operating in 
three
 principal segments: (1) the Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks; (2) the Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles; and (3) the Financial Services segment (PFS) includes finance and leasing products and services provided to customers and dealers. PACCAR’s finance and leasing activities are principally related to PACCAR products and associated equipment. PACCAR’s sales and revenues are derived primarily from North America and Europe. The Company also operates in Australia and Brasil and sells trucks and parts to customers in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America.

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition:

Truck, Parts and Other:
 The Company enters into sales contracts with customers associated with purchases of the Company’s products and services including trucks, parts, product support, and other related services. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue for the amount of consideration it will receive for delivering a product or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product or receives benefits of the service. The Company excludes sales taxes, value added taxes and other related taxes assessed by government agencies from revenue. There are no significant financing components included in product or services revenue since generally customers pay shortly after the products or services are transferred. In the Truck and Parts segment, when the Company grants extended payment terms on selected receivables and charges interest, interest income is recognized when earned.

The Company recognizes truck and parts sales as revenue when control of the products is transferred to customers which generally occurs upon shipment, except for certain truck sales which are subject to a residual value guarantee (RVG) by the Company. The standard payment term for trucks and aftermarket parts is typically within 30 days, but the Company may grant extended payment terms on selected receivables. The Company recognizes revenue for the invoice amount adjusted for estimated sales incentives and returns. Sales incentives and returns are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted to current period revenue when the most likely amount of consideration the Company expects to receive changes or becomes fixed. Truck and part sales include a standard product warranty which is included in cost of sales. The Company has elected to treat delivery services as a fulfillment activity with revenues recognized when the customer obtains control of the product. Delivery revenue is included in revenues and the related costs are included in cost of sales. As a practical expedient, the Company is not disclosing truck order backlog, as a significant majority of the backlog has a duration of less than one year.

Truck sales with RVGs that allow customers the option to return their truck are accounted for as a sale when the customer does not have an economic incentive to return the truck to the Company, or as an operating lease when the customer does have an economic incentive to return the truck. The estimate of customers’ economic incentive to return the trucks is based on an analysis of historical guaranteed buyback value and estimated market value. When truck sales with RVGs are accounted for as a sale, revenue is recognized when the truck is transferred to the customer less an amount for expected returns. Expected return rates are estimated by using a historical weighted average return rate over a 
five-year
 period. The estimated value of the truck assets to be returned and the related return liabilities at December
31, 2019 were $
473.0
 and $
503.4
, respectively, compared to $
319.8
 and $
329.3
 at December 31, 2018, respectively. The Company’s total commitment to acquire trucks at a guaranteed value for contracts accounted for as a sale was $
894.5
 at December 31, 2019.

Revenues from extended warranties, operating leases and other include optional extended warranty and repair and maintenance (R&M) service contracts which can be purchased for periods generally ranging up to 
five years
. The Company defers revenue based on stand-alone observable selling prices when it receives payments in advance and generally recognizes the revenue on a straight-line basis over the warranty or R&M contract periods. See Note I, Product Support Liabilities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Also included are truck sales with an RVG accounted for as an operating lease. A liability is created for the residual value obligation with the remainder of the proceeds recorded as deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period, which typically ranges from 
three
 to 
five
 years

. Total operating lease income from truck sales with RVGs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $
159.7
 and $
152.6
, respectively.

36

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

Aftermarket parts sales allow for returns which are estimated at the time of sale based on historical data. At December 31, 2019, the estimated value of the returned goods asset and the related return liability were $
56.3
 and $
126.3
, respectively, compared to $
49.0
 and $
104.5
 at December
31, 2018, respectively. 

Parts dealer services and other revenues are recognized as services are performed. 

Revenue from winch sales and other is primarily derived from the industrial winch business. Winch sales are recognized when the product is transferred to a customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Also within this category are other revenues not attributable to a reportable segment.

Financial Services:
 The Company’s Financial Services segment products include loans to customers collateralized by the vehicles being financed, finance leases to lease equipment to retail customers and dealers, dealer wholesale financing which includes floating-rate wholesale loans to PACCAR dealers for new and used trucks, and operating leases which include rentals on Company owned equipment. Interest income from finance and other receivables is recognized using the interest method. Certain loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to interest income over the expected life of the contracts using the straight-line method which approximates the interest method. 

Operating lease rental revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Customer contracts may include additional services such as excess mileage, repair and maintenance and other services on which revenue is recognized when earned. The Company’s full-service lease arrangements bundle these additional services. Rents for full-service lease contracts are allocated between lease and non-lease components based on the relative stand-alone price of each component. Taxes, such as sales and use and value added, which are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from the measurement of lease income and expenses. Rental revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $
798.2
, $
797.1
 and $
760.9
, respectively. Depreciation and related leased unit operating expenses were $
721.6
, $
686.9
 and $
665.7
 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Recognition of interest income and rental revenue is
suspended (put on non-accrual status) when the receivable becomes more than 90 days past the contractual due date or earlier if some other event causes the Company to determine that collection is not probable. Accordingly, 

no

 finance receivables more than 90 days past due were accruing interest at December 31, 2019 or December
31, 2018. Recognition is resumed if
the receivable becomes current by the payment of all amounts due under the terms of the existing contract and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if not contractually modified) or if the customer makes scheduled payments for three months and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable (if contractually modified). Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms.

Finance leases are secured by the trucks and related equipment being leased and the lease terms generally range from 
three
 to 
five
 years

 depending on the type and use of the equipment. The lessee is required to either purchase the equipment or guarantee to the Company a stated residual value upon the disposition of the equipment at the end of the finance lease term. 

Operating lease terms generally range from 
three
 to 
five
 years

. At the end of the operating lease term, the lessee has the option to return the equipment to the Company or purchase the equipment at its fair market value.

The Company determines its estimate of the residual value of leased vehicles by considering the length of the lease term, the truck model, the expected usage of the truck and anticipated market demand. If the sales price of the truck at the end of the agreement differs from the Company’s estimated residual value, a gain or loss will result. Future market conditions, changes in government regulations and other factors outside the Company’s control could impact the ultimate sales price of trucks returned under these contracts. Residual values are reviewed regularly and adjusted if market conditions warrant. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents:
 Cash equivalents consist of liquid investments with a maturity at date of purchase of 
90

days or less.

Marketable Debt Securities:
 The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. These investments are stated at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). 

The Company utilizes third-party pricing services for all of its marketable debt security valuations. The Company reviews the pricing methodology used by the third‑party pricing services, including the manner employed to collect market information. On a quarterly basis, the Company also performs review and validation procedures on the pricing information received from the third‑party providers. These procedures help ensure that the fair value information used by the Company is determined in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.

37

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

The Company evaluates its investment in marketable debt securities at the end of each reporting period to determine if a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. Realized losses are recognized upon management’s determination that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary. The determination of other-than-temporary impairment is a subjective process, requiring the use of judgments and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of recovery. The Company reviews and evaluates its investments at least quarterly to identify investments that have indications of other-than-temporary impairments. It is reasonably possible that a change in estimate could occur in the near term relating to other-than-temporary impairment. Accordingly, the Company considers several factors when evaluating debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment, including whether the decline in fair value of the security is due to increased default risk for the specific issuer or market interest rate risk. 

In assessing default risk, the Company considers the collectability of principal and interest payments by monitoring changes to issuers’ credit ratings, specific credit events associated with individual issuers as well as the credit ratings of any financial guarantor, and the extent and duration to which amortized cost exceeds fair value. 

In assessing market interest rate risk, including benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, the Company considers its intent for selling the securities and whether it is more likely than not the Company will be able to hold these securities until the recovery of any unrealized losses.

Receivables:

Trade and Other Receivables:
 The Company’s trade and other receivables are recorded at cost, net of allowances. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, trade and other receivables included trade receivables from dealers and customers of $
1,055.0
 and $
1,103.6
 and other receivables of $
251.1
 and $
210.8
 relating primarily to value added tax receivables and supplier allowances and rebates. 

Finance and Other Receivables:

Loans
 – Loans represent fixed or floating-rate loans to customers collateralized by the vehicles purchased and are recorded at amortized cost. 

Finance leases
 – Finance leases are sales-type finance leases, which lease equipment to retail customers and dealers. These leases are reported as the sum of minimum lease payments receivable and estimated residual value of the property subject to the contracts, reduced by unearned interest. 

Dealer wholesale financing
 – Dealer wholesale financing is floating-rate wholesale loans to PACCAR dealers for new and used trucks and are recorded at amortized cost. The loans are collateralized by the trucks being financed. 

Operating lease receivables and other
 – Operating lease receivables and other include monthly rentals due on operating leases, unamortized loan and lease origination costs, interest on loans and other amounts due within one year in the normal course of business. 

Allowance for Credit Losses:

Truck, Parts and Other:
 The Company historically has not experienced significant losses or past due amounts on trade and other receivables in its Truck, Parts and Other businesses. Accounts are considered past due once the unpaid balance is over 

30

days
 outstanding based on contractual payment terms. Accounts are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible. The allowance for credit losses for Truck, Parts and Other was $

1.0

 for the years ended December
31, 2019 and 2018. Net charge-offs were $
.3
, $
.1
 and $
.1
 for the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Financial Services:
 The Company continuously monitors the payment performance of its finance receivables. For large retail finance customers and dealers with wholesale financing, the Company regularly reviews their financial statements and makes site visits and phone contact as appropriate. If the Company becomes aware of circumstances that could cause those customers or dealers to face financial difficulty, whether or not they are past due, the customers are placed on a watch list. 

The Company modifies loans and finance leases in the normal course of its Financial Services operations. The Company may modify loans and finance leases for commercial reasons or for credit reasons. Modifications for commercial reasons are changes to contract 

38

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

terms for customers that are not considered to be in financial difficulty. Insignificant delays are modifications extending terms up to three months for customers experiencing some short-term financial stress, but not considered to be in financial difficulty. Modifications for credit reasons are changes to contract terms for customers considered to be in financial difficulty. The Company’s modifications typically result in granting more time to pay the contractual amounts owed and charging a fee and interest for the term of the modification. 

When considering whether to modify customer accounts for credit reasons, the Company evaluates the creditworthiness of the customers and modifies those accounts that the Company considers likely to perform under the modified terms. When the Company modifies a loan or finance lease for credit reasons and grants a concession, the modification is classified as a troubled debt restructuring (TDR). The Company does not typically grant credit modifications for customers that do not meet minimum underwriting standards since the Company normally repossesses the financed equipment in these circumstances. When such modifications do occur, they are considered TDRs.

On average, modifications extended contractual terms by approximately 
five months
 in 2019 and 
six months
 in 2018 and did not have a significant effect on the weighted average term or interest rate of the total portfolio at December
31, 2019 and 2018.

The Company has developed a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses for its two portfolio segments, retail and wholesale. The retail segment consists of retail loans and sales-type finance leases, net of unearned interest. The wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing loans to dealers that are collateralized by trucks and other collateral. The wholesale segment generally has less risk than the retail segment. Wholesale receivables generally are shorter in duration than retail receivables, and the Company requires periodic reporting of the wholesale dealer’s financial condition, conducts periodic audits of the trucks being financed and in many cases, obtains guarantees or other security such as dealership assets. In determining the allowance for credit losses, retail loans and finance leases are evaluated together since they relate to a similar customer base, their contractual terms require regular payment of principal and interest, generally over 
three
 to 
five
 years

, and they are secured by the same type of collateral. The allowance for credit losses consists of both specific and general reserves. 

The Company individually evaluates certain finance receivables for impairment. Finance receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment consist of all wholesale accounts and certain large retail accounts with past due balances or otherwise determined to be at a higher risk of loss. A finance receivable is impaired if it is considered probable the Company will be unable to collect all contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled. In addition, all retail loans and leases which have been classified as TDRs and all customer accounts over 90 days past due are considered impaired. Generally, impaired accounts are on non-accrual status. Impaired accounts classified as TDRs which have been performing for 90 consecutive days are placed on accrual status if it is deemed probable that the Company will collect all principal and interest payments. 

Impaired receivables are generally considered collateral dependent. Large balance retail and all wholesale impaired receivables are individually evaluated to determine the appropriate reserve for losses. The determination of reserves for large balance impaired receivables considers the fair value of the associated collateral. When the underlying collateral fair value exceeds the Company’s recorded investment, no reserve is recorded. Small balance impaired receivables with similar risk characteristics are evaluated as a separate pool to determine the appropriate reserve for losses using the historical loss information discussed below.

The Company evaluates finance receivables that are not individually impaired on a collective basis and determines the general allowance for credit losses for both retail and wholesale receivables based on historical loss information, using past due account data and current market conditions. Information used includes assumptions regarding the likelihood of collecting current and past due accounts, repossession rates, the recovery rate on the underlying collateral based on used truck values and other pledged collateral or recourse. The Company has developed a range of loss estimates for each of its country portfolios based on historical experience, taking into account loss frequency and severity in both strong and weak truck market conditions. A projection is made of the range of estimated credit losses inherent in the portfolio from which an amount is determined as probable based on current market conditions and other factors impacting the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers and their ability to repay. After determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses, a provision for losses on finance receivables is charged to income as necessary to reflect management’s estimate of incurred credit losses, net of recoveries, inherent in the portfolio. 

In determining the fair value of the collateral, the Company uses a pricing matrix and categorizes the fair value as Level 2 in the hierarchy of fair value measurement. The pricing matrix is reviewed quarterly and updated as appropriate. The pricing matrix considers the make, model and year of the equipment as well as recent sales prices of comparable equipment sold individually, which is the lowest unit of account, through wholesale channels to the Company’s dealers (principal market). The fair value of the collateral also considers the overall condition of the equipment.

39

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

Accounts are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible, which generally occurs upon repossession of the collateral. Typically the timing between the repossession and charge-off is not significant. In cases where repossession is delayed (e.g., for legal proceedings), the Company records a partial charge-off. The charge-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the recorded investment.

Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost of inventories in the U.S. is determined principally by the last‑in, first-out (LIFO) method. Cost of all other inventories is determined principally by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Cost of sales and revenues include shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver products to dealers and customers. 

Equipment on Operating Leases:
 The Company’s Financial Services segment leases equipment under operating leases to its customers. In addition, in the Truck segment, equipment sold to customers in Europe subject to an RVG by the Company may be accounted for as an operating lease. Equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on the straight-line basis to the lower of the estimated residual value or guarantee value. Lease and guarantee periods generally range from 
three
 to 
five
 years

. Estimated useful lives of the equipment range from 
three
 to 
ten
 years

. The Company reviews residual values of equipment on operating leases periodically to determine that recorded amounts are appropriate.

Property, Plant and Equipment:
 Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of assets. Certain production tooling is amortized on a unit of production basis.

Long-lived Assets and Goodwill:

The Company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment when events and circumstances warrant a review. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. There were no significant impairment charges for the three years ended December
31, 2019. Goodwill was $
109.1
 and $
112.0
 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in value was mostly due to currency translation.

Product Support Liabilities:

Product support liabilities include estimated future payments related to product warranties and deferred revenues on optional extended warranties and R&M contracts. The Company generally offers 
one year
 warranties covering most of its vehicles and related aftermarket parts. For vehicles equipped with engines manufactured by PACCAR, the Company generally offers 
two year
 warranties on the engine. Specific terms and conditions vary depending on the product and the country of sale. Optional extended warranty and R&M contracts can be purchased for periods which generally range up to 
five years
. Warranty expenses and reserves are estimated and recorded at the time products or contracts are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of any recoveries. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded liabilities and adjusts them as appropriate to reflect actual experience. Revenue from extended warranty and R&M contracts is deferred and recognized to income generally on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Warranty and R&M costs on these contracts are recognized as incurred.

Derivative Financial Instruments:
 As part of its risk management strategy, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge against interest rate and foreign currency risk. Certain derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are subject to hedge accounting. Derivative instruments that are not subject to hedge accounting are held as derivatives not designated as hedged instruments. The Company’s policies prohibit the use of derivatives for speculation or trading. At the inception of each hedge relationship, the Company documents its risk management objectives, procedures and accounting treatment. All of the Company’s interest-rate and certain foreign-exchange contracts are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements. Each agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default and certain other termination events. For derivative financial instruments, the Company has elected not to offset derivative positions in the balance sheet with the same counterparty under the same agreements and is not required to post or receive collateral.

Exposure limits and minimum credit ratings are used to minimize the risks of counterparty default. The Company’s maximum exposure to potential default of its derivative counterparties is limited to the asset position of its derivative portfolio. The asset position of the Company’s derivative portfolio was $
56.3
 at December 31, 2019
.

The Company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness of interest-rate contracts 

and net investment hedges 

at inception and uses quantitative analysis to assess subsequent effectiveness on a quarterly basis. For foreign-exchange contracts, the Company performs quarterly assessments to ensure that critical terms continue to match. All components of the derivative instrument’s gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the Company determines that a derivative financial instrument has ceased to be a highly effective hedge. Cash flows from derivative instruments are included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Foreign Currency Translation:

For most of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, the local currency is the functional currency. All assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the weighted average rates for the period. Translation adjustments are recorded in AOCI. The Company uses the U.S.
dollar as the functional currency for all but one of its Mexican subsidiaries, which uses the local currency. For the U.S. functional currency entities in Mexico, inventories, cost of sales, property, plant and equipment and depreciation are remeasured at historical rates and resulting adjustments are included in net income.

Earnings per Share:
 Basic earnings per common share are computed by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the effect of any participating securities. Diluted earnings per common share are computed assuming that all potentially dilutive securities are converted into common shares under the treasury stock method. 

Reclassifications:
 Due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the Company reclassified certain prior period balances to conform to the 2019 presentation. Operating cash flows from sales-type finance leases and dealer direct loans on new trucks for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to Other assets, net (increase of $
30.1
 million for 2018 and $
58.4
 million for 2017) and Trade and other receivables (decrease of $
57.1
 million for 2018 and increase of $
13.5
 million for 2017), respectively, within cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company changed its presentation of Finance leases as of December 31, 2018 in Note E from gross to net of unearned interest for comparability with the current period. As of December 31, 2018, unearned interest on finance leases was $
387.5
 million.

New Accounting Pronouncements

New Lease Standard

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, 
Leases (Topic 842)
, including subsequently issued ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance in ASU 2016-02. Under the new lease standard, lessees recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases (other than short-term leases). Lessor accounting is largely unchanged, except for a reduction in the capitalization of certain initial direct costs and the classification of certain cash flows. This ASU may be applied retrospectively in each reporting period presented or modified retrospectively with the cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective basis, with no effect on Retained earnings. 

The Company elected the package of practical expedients for its leases existing prior to the adoption of this ASU that will retain prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard. For lessee accounting, the Company elected the short-term lease exemption to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for any leases with a duration of twelve months or less. For lessor accounting, the Company elected to exclude taxes collected from customers, such as sales and use and value added, from the measurement of lease income and expense.

The new standard requires lessors within the scope of ASC 942, 
Financial Services – Depository and Lending
, to classify principal payments received from sales-type and direct financing leases in investing activities in the statement of cash flows. The Company continues to present cash receipts from direct finance leases as an investing cash inflow and reclassified cash flows from sales-type leases from operating to investing activities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, total cash originations and cash receipts from sales-type leases were $
224.3
 million and $
197.0
 million, respectively.

The cumulative effect of the changes made to the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet on January 1, 2019 for the adoption of ASU 2016-02 was as follows:

Other New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
, including subsequently issued ASUs to clarify the implementation guidance in ASU 2016-13. The amendment introduces new guidance for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including finance receivables, trade receivables and available-for-sale debt securities.

Under this new model, expected credit losses will be based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability, replacing the current incurred loss model. This ASU also updates the methodology for recording credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities from the write-down for other-than-temporary impairment to the allowance approach. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. This amendment should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Upon adoption on January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses on finance receivable portfolio will increase by $
6.2
 million, and the increase in allowance for losses on trade receivables and available-for-sale debt securities will be immaterial. The cumulative effect adjustment will decrease Retained earnings by $
4.6
 million, net of tax.

Marketable debt securities with continuous unrealized losses and their related fair values were as follows:

For the investment securities in gross unrealized loss positions identified above, the Company does not intend to sell the investment securities. It is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of the unrealized losses, and the Company expects that the contractual principal and interest will be received on the investment securities. As a result, the Company recognized 

no

 other-than-temporary impairments

Experience indicates substantially all of dealer wholesale financing will be repaid within 
one year
. In addition, repayment experience indicates that some loans, leases and other finance receivables will be paid prior to contract maturity, while others may be extended or modified.

For the following credit quality disclosures, finance receivables are classified into two portfolio segments, wholesale and retail. The retail portfolio is further segmented into dealer retail and customer retail. The dealer wholesale segment consists of truck inventory financing to PACCAR dealers. The dealer retail segment consists of loans and leases to participating dealers and franchises that use the proceeds to fund customers’ acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. The customer retail segment consists of loans and leases directly to customers for the acquisition of commercial vehicles and related equipment. Customer retail receivables are further segregated between fleet and owner/operator classes. The fleet class consists of customer retail accounts operating more than five trucks. All other customer retail accounts are considered owner/operator. These two classes have similar measurement attributes, risk characteristics and common methods to monitor and assess credit risk.

Impaired Loan

s:

 Impaired loans are summarized below. The impaired loans with specific reserve represent the unpaid principal balance. 

The recorded investment of impaired loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was not significantly different than the unpaid principal balance.

During the period the loans above were considered impaired, interest income recognized on a cash basis was as follows:

Credit Quality: 
The Company's customers are principally concentrated in the transportation industry in North America, Europe and Australia. The Company’s portfolio assets are diversified over a large number of customers and dealers with no single customer or dealer balances representing over 
5
% of the total portfolio assets. The Company retains as collateral a security interest in the related equipment.

At the inception of each contract, the Company considers the credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors credit quality based on past due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past due status of customers and the risk of loss.

The Company has three credit quality indicators: performing, watch and at-risk. Performing accounts pay in accordance with the contractual terms and are not considered high-risk. Watch accounts include accounts 31 to 90 days past due and large accounts that are performing but are considered to be high‑risk. Watch accounts are not impaired. At-risk accounts are accounts that are impaired, including TDRs, accounts over 90 days past due and other accounts on non-accrual status. 
The tables below summarize the Company’s finance receivables by credit quality indicator and portfolio class.

LEASES 

[/TABLE]

The Company leases certain facilities and equipment. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. The consideration in the contract is allocated to each separate lease and non-lease component of the contract generally based on the relative stand-alone price of the components. The lease component is accounted for in accordance with the lease standard and the non-lease component is accounted for in accordance with other standards. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments unless the rate implicit in the lease is available. The lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases that have a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date (“short-term leases”) are not included in the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities. Lease expense for the short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The components of lease expense were as follows:

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

At December
31,
2019, PACCAR had standby letters of credit and surety bonds totaling $
47.8
, from third-party financial institutions, in the normal course of business, which guarantee various insurance, financing and other activities. At December
31,
2019, PACCAR’s financial services companies, in the normal course of business, had outstanding commitments to fund new loan and lease transactions amounting to $
885.8
. The commitments generally expire in 
90

days. The Company had other commitments, primarily to purchase production inventory, equipment and energy amounting to $
119.8
, $
63.9
, $
60.6
, $
.8
 and nil for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 and beyond, respectively. 

The Company is involved in various stages of investigations and cleanup actions in different countries related to environmental matters. In certain of these matters, the Company has been designated as a “potentially responsible party” by domestic and foreign environmental agencies. The Company has accrued the estimated costs to investigate and complete cleanup actions where it is probable that the Company will incur such costs in the future. Expenditures related to environmental activities for the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $
1.3
, $
1.2
 and $
1.9
, respectively. 

While the timing and amount of the ultimate costs associated with future environmental cleanup cannot be determined, management expects that these matters will not have a significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

On July 19, 2016, the European Commission (EC) concluded its investigation of all major European truck manufacturers and reached a settlement with DAF. Following the settlement, claims and lawsuits have been filed against the Company, DAF and certain DAF subsidiaries and other truck manufacturers in various European jurisdictions. These claims and lawsuits include a number of collective proceedings, including proposed class actions in the United Kingdom, alleging EC-related claims and seeking unspecified damages.

Others may bring EC-related claims and lawsuits against the Company or its subsidiaries. While the Company believes it has meritorious 

54

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

defenses, such claims and lawsuits will likely take a significant period of time to resolve. The Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result given the early stage of these claims and lawsuits. An adverse outcome of such proceedings could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

PACCAR is also a defendant in various other legal proceedings and, in addition, there are various other contingent liabilities arising in the normal course of business. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that disposition of these various other proceedings and contingent liabilities will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Severance Costs: 
The Company incurred severance expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017 of $
5.8
, $
.7
 and $
.8
, respectively.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans: 
The Company has several defined benefit pension plans, which cover a majority of its employees. The Company evaluates its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and considers changes based upon market conditions and other factors. 

The expected return on plan assets is determined by using a market-related value of assets, which is calculated based on an average of the previous five years of asset gains and losses. 

Generally, accumulated unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the 
10
% corridor approach. The corridor is defined as the greater of either 10% of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. The amortization amount is the excess beyond the corridor divided by the average remaining estimated service life of participants on a straight-line basis.

The Company funds its pensions in accordance with applicable employee benefit and tax laws. The Company contributed $
35.7
 to its pension plans in 2019 and $
88.9
 in 2018. The Company expects to contribute in the range of $
80.0
 to $
120.0
 to its pension plans in 2020, of which $
21.4
 is estimated to satisfy minimum funding requirements. Annual benefits expected to be paid beginning January
1,
2020 are $
133.2
, $
103.0
, $
109.1
, $
113.6
, $
120.5
 and a total of $
683.5
 for the five years thereafter.

Plan assets are invested in global equity and debt securities through professional investment managers with the objective to achieve targeted risk adjusted returns and maintain liquidity sufficient to fund current benefit payments. Typically, each defined benefit plan has an investment policy that includes a target for asset mix, including maximum and minimum ranges for allocation percentages by investment category. The actual allocation of assets may vary at times based upon rebalancing policies and other factors. The Company periodically assesses the target asset mix by evaluating external sources of information regarding the long-term historical return, volatilities and expected future returns for each investment category. In addition, the long-term rates of return assumptions for pension accounting are reviewed annually to ensure they are appropriate. Target asset mix and forecast long-term returns by asset category are considered in determining the assumed long-term rates of return, although historical returns realized are given some consideration.

The fair value of mutual funds, common stocks and U.S. treasuries is determined using the market approach and is based on the quoted prices in active markets. These securities are categorized as Level 1. The fair value of debt securities is determined using the market approach and is based on the quoted market prices of the securities or other observable inputs. These securities are categorized as Level 2. 

The fair value of commingled trust funds is determined using the market approach and is based on the unadjusted net asset value (NAV) per unit as determined by the sponsor of the fund based on the fair values of underlying investments. These assets are collective investment trusts, and substantially all of these investments have no redemption restrictions or unfunded commitments. Securities measured at NAV per unit as a practical expedient are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Metal and Electrical Engineering Industry Pension Fund is a multi-employer union plan incorporating all DAF employees in the Netherlands and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire November 30, 2020. The Company’s contributions were less than 

5

% of the total contributions to the plan for the last two reporting periods ending December 2019. The plan is required by law (the Netherlands Pension Act) to have a coverage ratio in excess of 
104.3
%. Because the coverage ratio of the plan was 
96.9
% at December 31, 2019, a funding improvement plan effective through 2028 is in place. The funding improvement plan includes a possible reduction in pension benefits and delays in future benefit increases. 

The Western Metal Industry Pension Plan is located in the U.S. and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on November
1,
2020. In accordance with the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, the plan continued to be certified as critical (red) status as of December 31, 2019, and a funding improvement plan has been implemented requiring additional contributions through 2022 as long as the plan remains in critical status. Contributions by the Company were 
20
% and 
14
% of the total contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Other plans are principally located in the U.S. and the Company’s contributions to these plans for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were less than

INCOME TAXES 

[/TABLE]

The Company’s tax rate is based on income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Tax law requires certain items to be included in the Company’s tax returns at different times than the items reflected in the Company’s financial statements. As a result, the Company’s annual tax rate reflected in its financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in the Company’s tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

The components of the Company’s income before income taxes include the following:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted new federal income tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). The Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 
35
% to 
21
%, imposed a one-time transition tax on the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax and created a modified territorial system. As a result, the Company recorded $
304.0
 of deferred tax benefits, due to the re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities at the new lower statutory tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded $
130.6
 of tax expense on the Company’s foreign earnings, which previously had been deferred from U.S. income tax and no adjustments have been made to the amounts. 

Based on the Company’s current operations, the Company does not expect that the repatriation of future foreign earnings will be subject to significant income tax as a result of the U.S. modified territorial system.

At December
31,
2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $
460.9
, of which $

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

[/TABLE]

As part of its risk management strategy, the Company enters into derivative contracts to hedge against interest rate and foreign currency risk.

Interest-Rate Contracts:
 The Company enters into various interest-rate contracts, including interest-rate swaps and cross currency interest-rate swaps. Interest-rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed for floating rate or floating for fixed rate interest payments based on the contractual notional amounts in a single currency. Cross currency interest-rate swaps involve the exchange of notional amounts and interest payments in different currencies. The Company is exposed to interest-rate and exchange-rate risk caused by market volatility as a result of its borrowing activities. The objective of these contracts is to mitigate the fluctuations on earnings, cash flows and fair value of borrowings. Net amounts paid or received are reflected as adjustments to interest expense.

At December
31,
2019, the notional amount of the Company’s interest-rate contracts was $
3,196.7
. Notional maturities for all interest-rate contracts are $

 The Company enters into foreign-exchange contracts to hedge certain anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso. The objective is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company enters into foreign-exchange contracts as net investment hedges to reduce the foreign currency exposure from its investments in foreign subsidiaries. At December

Fair Value Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. 
The following table presents the amounts recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:

The above table excludes the cumulative basis adjustments on discounted hedge relationships of $(

Cash Flow Hedges

Substantially all of the Company’s interest-rate contracts and some foreign-exchange contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI. Amounts in AOCI are reclassified into net income in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is 
8.5
 years.

The following table presents the pre-tax effects of derivative instruments recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI): 

The amount of gain recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2019 that is estimated to be reclassified into earnings in the following 12
months if interest rates and exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately $
2.7
, net of taxes. The fixed interest earned on finance receivables will offset the amount recognized in interest expense, resulting in a stable interest margin consistent with the Company’s risk management strategy.

The amount of gains or losses reclassified out of AOCI into net income based on
 
the probability that the original forecasted transactions would not occur was nil for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Net Investment Hedges

Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as net investment hedges are recorded in AOCI as an adjustment to the Cumulative Translation Adjustment (CTA). At December 31, 2019, the notional amount of the outstanding net investment hedges was $
348.2

Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments

For other risk management purposes, the Company enters into derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivative instruments are used to mitigate the risk of market volatility arising from borrowings and foreign currency denominated transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in earnings in the period in which the change occurs.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

[/TABLE]

Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value are either observable or unobservable. These inputs have been categorized into the fair value hierarchy described below.

Level
1 – Valuations are based on quoted prices that the Company has the ability to obtain in actively traded markets for identical assets or liabilities. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market or exchange traded market, valuation of these instruments does not require a significant degree of judgment.

Level
2 – Valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.

Level
3 – Valuations are based on model-based techniques for which some or all of the assumptions are obtained from indirect market information that is significant to the overall fair value measurement and which require a significant degree of management judgment. 

There were 

no

transfers of assets or liabilities between Level
1 and Level
2 of the fair value hierarchy during the year ended December 31,
2019. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.

The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to measure fair value for assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurements.

Marketable Securities:
 The Company’s marketable debt securities consist of municipal bonds, government obligations, investment-grade corporate obligations, commercial paper, asset-backed securities and term deposits. The fair value of U.S. government obligations is determined using the market approach and is based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level
1. 

The fair value of U.S. government agency obligations, non-U.S. government bonds, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial paper and term deposits is determined using the market approach and is primarily based on matrix pricing as a practical expedient which does not rely exclusively on quoted prices for a specific security. Significant inputs used to determine fair value include interest rates, yield curves, credit rating of the security and other observable market information and are categorized as Level
2. 

Derivative Financial Instruments:
 The Company’s derivative contracts consist of interest-rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts. These derivative contracts are traded over the counter and their fair value is determined using industry standard valuation models, which are based on the income approach (i.e., discounted cash flows). The significant observable inputs into the valuation models include interest rates, yield curves, currency exchange rates, credit default swap spreads and forward rates and are categorized as Level
2.

Fair Value Disclosure of Other Financial Instruments

For financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value, the Company uses the following methods and assumptions to determine the fair value. These instruments are categorized as Level 2, except cash which is categorized as Level 1 and fixed rate loans which are categorized as Level

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

Cash and Cash Equivalents: 

Carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Financial Services Net Receivables:
 For floating-rate loans, wholesale financing, and operating lease and other trade receivables, carrying values approximate fair values. For fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on assumptions regarding the credit and market risks to approximate current rates for comparable loans. Finance lease receivables and related allowance for credit losses have been excluded from the accompanying table.

Debt:
 The carrying amounts of financial services commercial paper, variable rate bank loans and variable rate term notes approximate fair value. For fixed rate debt, fair values are estimated using the income approach by discounting cash flows to their present value based on current rates for comparable debt.

The Company’s estimate of fair value for fixed rate loans and debt that are not carried at fair value was as follows:

STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS

[/TABLE]

PACCAR has certain plans under which officers and key employees may be granted options to purchase shares of the Company’s authorized but unissued common stock under plans approved by stockholders. Non‑employee directors and certain officers may be granted restricted shares of the Company’s common stock under plans approved by stockholders. Options outstanding under these plans were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. Options expire no later than 
ten years
 from the grant date and generally vest after 
three years
. Restricted stock awards generally vest over 
three years
 or earlier upon meeting certain age and service requirements. 

The Company recognizes compensation cost on these options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service less estimated forfeitures based on historical experience. The maximum number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized for issuance under these plans is 
46.7
 million shares, and as of December
31,
2019, the maximum number of shares available for future grants was 
12.5
 million. 

The estimated fair value of each option award is determined on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model that uses assumptions noted in the following table. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility. The dividend yield is based on an estimated future dividend yield using projected net income for the next five years, implied dividends and Company stock price. 
The expected term is based on the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience.

The fair value of options granted was $
7.3
, $
6.3
 and $
6.4
 for the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value of options vested during the years ended December
31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $
5.8
, $
5.3
 and $
5.2
, respectively.

SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION

[/TABLE]

PACCAR operates in 
three
 principal segments: Truck, Parts and Financial Services. The Company evaluates the performance of its Truck and Parts segments based on operating profits, which excludes investment income, other income and expense, and income taxes. The Financial Services segment’s performance is evaluated based on income before income taxes. Geographic revenues from external customers are presented based on the country of the customer. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements as described in Note A. 

Truck and Parts: 
The Truck segment includes the design and manufacture of high-quality, light-, medium- and heavy-duty commercial trucks and the Parts segment includes the distribution of aftermarket parts for trucks and related commercial vehicles, both of which are sold through the same network of independent dealers. These segments derive a large proportion of their revenues and operating profits from operations in North America and Europe. The Truck segment incurs substantial costs to design, manufacture and sell trucks to its customers. The sale of new trucks provides the Parts segment with the basis for parts sales that may continue over the life of the truck, but are generally concentrated in the first five years after truck delivery. To reflect the benefit the Parts segment receives from costs incurred by the Truck segment, certain expenses are allocated from the Truck segment to the Parts segment. The expenses allocated are based on a percentage of the average annual expenses for factory overhead, engineering, research and development and SG&A expenses for the preceding five years. The allocation is based on the ratio of the average parts direct margin dollars (net sales less material and labor costs) to the total truck and parts direct margin dollars for the previous five years. The Company believes such expenses have been allocated on a reasonable basis. Truck segment assets related to the indirect expense allocation are not allocated to the Parts segment. 

69

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (currencies in millions)

Financial Services:

 The Financial Services segment derives its earnings primarily from financing or leasing of PACCAR products and services provided to truck customers and dealers. Revenues are primarily generated from operations in North America and Europe. 

In Europe, the Financial Services and Truck segments centralized the marketing of used trucks, including those units sold by the Truck segment subject to an RVG. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, when a customer returns the truck at the end of the RVG contract, the Company’s Truck segment records a reduction in an RVG liability and the Company’s Financial Services segment records a used truck asset and revenue from the subsequent sale. Certain gains and losses from the sale of these used trucks are shared with the Truck segment. Revenue from the sale of used trucks from the Truck segment in Europe in prior periods are immaterial.  

Other:
 Included in Other is the Company’s industrial winch manufacturing business as well as sales, income and expense not attributable to a reportable segment. Other also includes non-service cost components of pension expense and a portion of corporate expenses. Intercompany interest income (expense) on cash advances to the financial services companies is included in Other and was $
.3
, $(

) and nil for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

management’s report on internal control over 

financial reporting

The management of PACCAR Inc (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31,
2019, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal Control
–
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31,
2019.

Ernst & Young LLP, the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report is included on page 74.

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of PACCAR Inc

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PACCAR Inc (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates
. 

[TABLE]

Product Warranty

Description of the Matter

The Company’s liability for product warranty totaled $440 million at December 31, 2019. As
discussed in Note A of the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s liability for product warranty is estimated and recorded at the time products are sold based on historical and current data and reasonable expectations for the future regarding the frequency and cost of warranty claims, net of recoveries. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded liabilities and adjusts them as appropriate to reflect actual experience.

Auditing the Company’s liability for product warranty is complex due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate and the application of significant management judgment, including the inputs used to estimate the number of and cost of future warranty claims. In addition, management formulates an estimate of recoveries from suppliers.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

To evaluate the liability for product warranty, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims, supplier recovery data and evaluating the methodologies and assumptions used in the warranty accrual calculation. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates through a hindsight analysis. We evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the warranty reserve process, including management’s assessment of the assumptions and data underlying the reserve.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of PACCAR Inc

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited PACCAR Inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, PACCAR Inc (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
