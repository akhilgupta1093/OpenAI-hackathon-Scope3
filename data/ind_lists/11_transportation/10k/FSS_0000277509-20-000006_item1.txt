 PART I Item 1. Business. Federal Signal Corporation, founded in 1901, was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1969. The Company designs, manufactures and supplies a suite of products and integrated solutions for municipal, governmental, industrial and commercial customers. The Company’s portfolio of products that it manufactures includes sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, vacuum- and hydro-excavation trucks (collectively, “safe-digging” trucks), street sweepers, road-marking and line-removal equipment, waterblasting equipment, dump truck bodies, trailers, and safety and security systems, including technology-based products and solutions for the public safety market. In addition, the Company engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive aftermarket offering to its customers. The Company operates 15 principal manufacturing facilities in five countries and provides products and integrated solutions to customers in all regions of the world. Narrative Description of Business Products manufactured and supplied, and services rendered, by the Company are divided into two reportable segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. The individual operating businesses are organized as such because they share certain characteristics, including technology, marketing, distribution and product application, which create long-term synergies. Corporate contains those items that are not included in the Company’s reportable segments. Financial information concerning the Company’s two reportable segments for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, is included in Note 17 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Information regarding the Company’s discontinued operations is included in Note 19 – Discontinued Operations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Environmental Solutions Group The Company’s Environmental Solutions Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of a full range of street sweepers, sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, safe-digging trucks, high-performance waterblasting equipment, dump truck bodies and trailers. The Group manufactures vehicles and equipment in the U.S. and Canada that are sold under the Elgin® , Vactor® , Guzzler® , TRUVAC TM, Westech TM, Jetstream® , Ox Bodies® , Crysteel® , J-Craft® , Duraclass® , Rugby® and Travis® brand names. Products are sold to both municipal and industrial customers either through a dealer network or direct sales to service customers generally depending on the type and geographic location of the customer. The acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Joe Johnson Equipment, Inc. and Joe Johnson Equipment (USA), Inc. (collectively, “JJE”) in 2016 extended the Environmental Solutions Group’s existing sales channel and increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. The acquisition of JJE also broadened the Environmental Solutions Group’s product offerings to include other products, such as refuse and recycling collection vehicles, camera systems, ice resurfacing equipment and snow-removal equipment. In addition to vehicle and equipment sales, the Group also engages in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a complete offering to its current and potential customers through its service centers located across North America. Under the Elgin brand name, the Company sells a leading U.S. brand of street sweepers primarily designed for large-scale cleaning of curbed streets, parking lots and other paved surfaces utilizing mechanical sweeping, vacuum and recirculating air technology. Vactor is a leading manufacturer of equipment solutions for cleaning and maintaining sewers and catch basins. Under the TRUVAC brand name, introduced in 2019, the Company manufactures a range of premium vacuum- and hydro-excavation trucks designed to satisfy the safe-digging requirements of businesses or organizations that locate and verify underground utility lines and pipes. Guzzler is a leader in industrial vacuum loaders used to manage industrial waste or recover and recycle valuable raw materials. Westech is a manufacturer of high-quality, rugged vacuum-excavation trucks. Jetstream manufactures high-pressure waterblasting equipment and accessories for commercial and industrial cleaning and maintenance operations. The Company manufactures and sells dump truck bodies and trailers under the Ox Bodies, Crysteel, J-Craft, Duraclass, Rugby and Travis brand names. In addition, as discussed in Note 2 – Acquisitions, on July 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and operations of Mark Rite Lines Equipment Company, Inc. (“MRL”), a U.S. manufacturer of truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking and line-removal equipment, including its wholly-owned subsidiary HighMark Traffic Services, Inc. The Company expects that MRL will provide an efficient entry into a new line of product offerings and access to new markets, and enable it to strengthen the Environmental Solutions Group’s market position as a specialty vehicle manufacturer in maintenance and infrastructure end-markets, leveraging its expertise in building chassis-based vehicles. 2 Safety and Security Systems Group The Company’s Safety and Security Systems Group is a leading manufacturer and supplier of comprehensive systems and products that law enforcement, fire rescue, emergency medical services, campuses, military facilities and industrial sites use to protect people and property. Offerings include systems for community alerting, emergency vehicles, first responder interoperable communications and industrial communications. Specific products include public safety equipment, such as vehicle lightbars and sirens, industrial signaling equipment, public warning systems and general alarm/public address systems. Products are sold under the Federal Signal TM, Federal Signal VAMA® and Victor® brand names. The Group operates manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Europe and South Africa. Marketing and Distribution Depending primarily on the type and geographic location of the end-customer, the Environmental Solutions Group uses either a dealer network, including JJE, or direct sales to serve customers. The 2017 acquisition of Truck Bodies and Equipment International (“TBEI”) increased the number of dealers within the Company’s network and also added additional direct sales resources. The dealer network serves both municipal and industrial end-markets. Within municipal markets, the majority of the Company’s dealers operate exclusively in their assigned territory. In conjunction with selling vehicles to end-customers, dealer representatives demonstrate vehicle functionality and capability and provide vehicle service. In addition to selling products manufactured by the Company, JJE distributes and re-sells products manufactured by other companies. The Company believes its regional, national and global dealer networks for vehicles is a distinguishing factor from its competitors. The Environmental Solutions Group’s direct sales channel concentrates primarily on the industrial, utility and construction market segments, and the service centers provide post-sale service, ancillary parts and equipment rentals. The acquisition of JJE increased the number of service centers through which its parts, service and rental offerings can be provided to current and potential customers. The Safety and Security Systems Group sells to industrial customers through wholesalers and distributors who are supported by Company sales personnel or independent manufacturer representatives. Products are also sold to municipal and governmental customers through active independent distributors, as well as through original equipment manufacturers and the direct sales force. The Company sells comprehensive integrated warning and interoperable communications through a combination of the direct sales force and independent distributors. International sales are made through independent foreign distributors or on a direct basis. Customers and Backlog No single customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s net sales in any year within the three-year period ended December 31, 2019. Of the $1,269.0 million total orders reported in 2019, approximately 34% were from U.S. municipal and governmental customers, 44% were from U.S. commercial and industrial customers and 22% were from non-U.S. customers. The Company’s backlog totaled $386.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $337.7 million at December 31, 2018. The increase of $49.2 million, or 15%, was primarily due to continued strong demand for sewer cleaners and safe-digging trucks, as well as higher orders for road-marking and line-removal equipment and refuse trucks. Backlogs vary by group due to the nature of the Company’s products and the buying patterns of its customers. The Environmental Solutions Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately three to six months of shipments. The Safety and Security Systems Group typically experiences an average backlog of approximately two months of shipments. Production of the Company’s December 31, 2019 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2020. Suppliers The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials from around the world for use in the manufacture of its products, although the majority of current purchases are from North American sources. To minimize risks relating to availability, price and quality of key products and components, the Company is party to numerous strategic supplier arrangements. Although certain materials are obtained from either a single-source supplier or a limited number of suppliers, the Company has generally identified alternative sources to minimize the interruption of its business in the event of supply disruptions. Components critical to the production of the Company’s vehicles, such as engines, are purchased from a select number of suppliers. The Company also purchases raw and fabricated steel, as well as commercial chassis, from multiple sources. In addition, we may incorporate chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. As a distributor of equipment manufactured by other companies, JJE relies on the availability of equipment supplied by others to meet customer demand. 3 While there are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of certain raw materials and components that could impact price, quality and availability in sufficient quantities, the Company believes it has adequate supplies and sources of availability of the raw materials and components necessary to meet its needs. Competition Within the Environmental Solutions Group, Elgin is recognized as a market leader among domestic sweeper competitors and differentiates itself primarily on product performance. The Vactor, TRUVAC and Guzzler brands each maintain a leading domestic position in their respective marketplaces by enhancing product performance with leading technology and application flexibility. Jetstream is a market leader in the in-plant cleaning segment of the U.S. waterblast industry, competing on product performance, rapid delivery and solutions services. JJE is a leading Canadian-based distributor of maintenance equipment for municipal and industrial markets. TBEI includes a portfolio of regional brands with market leadership positions in distinct geographies and product categories, differentiating itself with its broad regional distribution network, focus on customer responsiveness and operational expertise. MRL is a market-leading manufacturer of road-marking and line-removal equipment. Within specific product categories and domestic markets, the businesses within the Safety and Security Systems Group are among the market leaders. The Group’s international market position varies from leader to ancillary participant depending on the geographic region and product line. Generally, competition is intense within all of the Group’s product lines and purchase decisions are made based on price, features, reputation, performance and service, often within competitive bidding situations. Patents and Trademarks The Company owns a number of patents and possesses rights under others to which it attaches importance, but it does not believe that its business as a whole is materially dependent upon any such patents or rights. The Company also owns a number of trademarks, including those listed within the “ Narrative Description of Business ” section above. We believe these trademarks are important in connection with the identification of our products and associated goodwill with customers, but no material part of the Company’s business is dependent on our trademarks. Employees The Company employed approximately 3,600 people in its businesses at December 31, 2019, with the Company’s U.S. hourly workers accounting for approximately 54% of its total workforce. Approximately 15% of the Company’s U.S. hourly workers were represented by unions at December 31, 2019. The Company believes that its labor relations with its employees are good. Governmental Regulation of the Environment As part of its ongoing commitment to environmental, social and governance initiatives, the Company endeavors to establish environmentally-friendly policies and objectives, and believes that these actions are also consistent with cost-effective operating practices. With the application of these policies, the Company believes it complies with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures in 2019 attributable to compliance with such laws were not material. The Company also believes that the overall impact of compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Seasonality Certain of the Company’s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. In general, the Company tends to have lower equipment sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. In addition, rental income and parts sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because many of the Company’s products are used for maintenance activities in North America, where usage is typically lower during periods of harsher weather conditions. 4 Executive Officers of the Registrant The following is a list of the Company’s executive officers, including their ages, business experience and positions as of February 1, 2020 : Jennifer L.
