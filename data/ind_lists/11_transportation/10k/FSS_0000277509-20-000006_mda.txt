 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is designed to provide information that is supplemental to, and shall be read together with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this Form 10-K. Information in MD&A is intended to assist the reader in obtaining an understanding of (i) the consolidated financial statements, (ii) the Company’s business segments and how the results of those segments impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition as a whole and (iii) how certain accounting principles affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Executive Summary The Company is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of (i) vehicles and equipment for maintenance and infrastructure end-markets, including sewer cleaners, industrial vacuum loaders, safe-digging trucks, street sweepers, waterblasting equipment, road-marking and line-removal equipment, dump truck bodies and trailers and (ii) public safety equipment, such as vehicle lightbars and sirens, industrial signaling equipment, public warning systems and general alarm/public address systems. In addition, we engage in the sale of parts, service and repair, equipment rentals and training as part of a comprehensive aftermarket offering to our customer base. We operate 15 manufacturing facilities in five countries and provide products and integrated solutions to municipal, governmental, industrial and commercial customers in all regions of the world. As described in Note 17 – Segment Information to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company’s business units are organized in two reportable segments: the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group. During 2019, the Company continued to focus on executing against its key long-term objectives, including the following: • Creating disciplined growth; • Improving manufacturing efficiencies and costs; • Leveraging invested capital; and • Diversifying our customer base. Highlights of the Company’s achievement against these objectives in 2019 include the following: • On July 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of MRL, a leading U.S. manufacturer of truck-mounted and ride-on road-marking and line-removal equipment. The combination of MRL with the businesses in our Environmental Solutions Group, extends our platform providing municipal and industrial customers with a complete suite of maintenance and infrastructure equipment and supporting solutions. • On a consolidated basis, we reported a 110 -basis point year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA* margin, delivering returns towards the high end of our target range. • Both our Environmental Solutions Group and our Safety and Security Systems Group reported improvement in net sales and earnings, delivering adjusted EBITDA margins* at or above the high end of our target ranges. • We have continued to focus on new product development and are encouraged that these efforts will provide additional opportunities to further diversify our customer base, penetrate new end-markets or gain access to new geographic regions. • Our eighty-twenty improvement (“ETI”) initiatives remain a critical part of our culture and we continue to focus on reducing product costs and improving manufacturing efficiencies across all our businesses. • On July 30, 2019, we refinanced our credit agreement, increasing our revolving credit facility to $500 million, with the potential to increase the facility by an additional $250 million for acquisitions. The new five -year facility also includes improved pricing and more favorable terms compared to the prior agreement. • With our strong balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and increased capacity under our new revolving credit facility, we are well positioned to continue to invest in internal growth initiatives, pursue strategic acquisitions and consider ways to return value to stockholders. • During the year, we announced the expansion of our Vactor production facility in Streator, Illinois. We are making good progress on the building construction and our efforts to hire up to 90 new employees at the facility. • During the year, we demonstrated our commitment to returning value to stockholders by paying cash dividends of $19.3 million in 2019, increased from $18.7 million in 2018, and spending $1.0 million repurchasing shares under our authorized repurchase program. 15 Our consolidated financial results in 2019 reflected year-over-year improvement in many areas, driven by both organic growth initiatives and benefits from our recent acquisitions: * The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. Refer to Item 6. Selected Financial Data for further discussion regarding these non-GAAP metrics and a reconciliation of each to the most comparable GAAP measure for each of the periods presented. 16 Results of Operations The following table summarizes our Consolidated Statements of Operations as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and illustrates the key financial indicators used to assess our consolidated financial results: (a) The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. Refer to Item 6. Selected Financial Data for further discussion regarding these non-GAAP metrics and a reconciliation of each to the most comparable GAAP measure for each of the periods presented. Year ended December 31, 2019 vs. year ended December 31, 2018 Net sales Net sales increased by $131.8 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, net sales increased by $129.4 million, or 15%, primarily due to a $39.7 million contribution from MRL, and increases in shipments of safe-digging trucks, street sweepers, and dump truck bodies of $38.1 million, $18.0 million, and $11.9 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket revenues increased by $15.9 million, represented by higher rental income and improved parts and service sales. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales increased by $2.4 million, or 1%, primarily due to improvements in industrial signaling equipment and public safety products of $6.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, partially offset by a $2.7 million reduction in sales of warning systems and an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.9 million. Cost of sales For the year ended December 31, 2019, cost of sales increased by $91.1 million, or 11%, compared to the prior year, largely due to an increase of $94.6 million, or 14%, within the Environmental Solutions Group, primarily attributable to increased sales volumes, additional cost of sales from the MRL acquisition, higher material costs, and a $4.6 million increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $0.4 million reduction in purchase accounting expenses. This increase was partially offset by a 17 decrease in cost of sales of $3.5 million, or 2%, within the Safety and Security Systems Group, largely due to favorable sales mix and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.1 million, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2019, gross profit increased by $40.7 million, or 14%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to improvements of $34.8 million and $5.9 million within the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group, respectively. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 26.4%, compared to 25.9% in the prior year, primarily driven by improvements within the Safety and Security Group and Environmental Solutions Group of 220 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. Margin improvements were primarily attributable to improved operating leverage, benefits from pricing actions and favorable sales mix. Selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses For the year ended December 31, 2019, selling, engineering, general and administrative (“SEG&A”) expenses increased by $14.1 million, or 9%, primarily due to increases within the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group of $8.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively. In addition, Corporate SEG&A expenses increased by $4.5 million. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses decreased from 14.6% in the prior year, to 14.2% in the current year. Operating income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $25.6 million, or 21%, to $147.1 million, compared to the prior year. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $26.4 million, or 23%, largely due to higher sales volumes and improved operating leverage, as well as a $3.6 million contribution from MRL. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.5 million, or 13%, largely due to benefits from pricing actions and improved sales mix, while Corporate expenses increased by $5.3 million. Consolidated operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 12.0%, compared to 11.2% in the prior year. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $1.4 million, or 15%, compared to the prior year, largely due to lower average debt levels and the effects of a reduction in the Company’s interest rate resulting from the refinancing of its revolving credit facility. Other expense (income), net For the year ended December 31, 2019, Other expense (income), net, totaled $0.6 million of expense, largely due to the recognition of $0.9 million of net periodic pension expense. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Other expense (income), net, totaled $0.6 million of expense, largely due to $0.4 million of net periodic pension expense and foreign currency transaction losses. Income tax expense The Company recognized income tax expense of $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in income tax expense in the current year was primarily due to higher earnings and the non-recurrence of an $8.6 million tax planning benefit which was recognized in the prior year, partially offset by the recognition of a $0.8 million tax benefit from the release of state deferred tax valuation allowance, and a $0.8 million increase in excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity. The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 21.8%, compared to 16.0% in 2018. For further discussion, see Note 10 – Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations was $108.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up $14.7 million, or 16%, compared to the prior year, largely due to the improved operating income and the $1.4 million reduction in interest expense, partially offset by the $12.3 million increase in income tax expense. 18 Year ended December 31, 2018 vs. year ended December 31, 2017 Net sales Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $191.0 million, or 21%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, net sales increased by $170.9 million, or 25%, largely due to $98.1 million of incremental net sales resulting from the 2017 acquisition of TBEI and organic sales growth of $72.8 million, or 12%. The organic growth was primarily due to improved shipments of vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners, in addition to higher aftermarket revenues, represented by increases in rental income, parts and services revenues and sales of used equipment. These improvements included benefits from pricing actions and were partially offset by lower sales of products manufactured by other companies, such as refuse trucks. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales increased by $20.1 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher sales into global public safety markets and improved international sales of outdoor warning systems. Cost of sales For the year ended December 31, 2018, cost of sales increased by $130.1 million, or 19%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, largely due to an increase of $117.1 million, or 21%, within the Environmental Solutions Group, primarily driven by increased sales volumes, the effects of a full-year of TBEI activity in 2018 compared with seven months in 2017, higher material costs and a $3.7 million increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in purchase accounting expenses. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, cost of sales increased by $13.0 million, or 10%, largely driven by higher sales volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects. Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross profit increased by $60.9 million, or 28%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to improvements of $53.8 million and $7.1 million within the Environmental Solutions Group and the Safety and Security Systems Group, respectively. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 25.9%, compared to 24.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a 210 basis point gross margin improvement within the Environmental Solutions Group, associated with improved operating leverage, benefits from actions taken in response to higher commodity costs, favorable sales mix and the reduction in purchase accounting expenses, described above, partially offset by the higher depreciation expense. Selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses For the year ended December 31, 2018, SEG&A expenses increased by $14.8 million, or 10%, primarily represented by a $13.2 million increase within the Environmental Solutions Group, largely the result of the addition of expenses of associated with the TBEI acquisition, including an increase in amortization expense of $3.2 million. SEG&A expenses within the Safety and Security Systems Group increased by $0.6 million, primarily due to higher expenses associated with new product development and other growth initiatives, while corporate SEG&A expenses increased by $1.0 million. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses decreased from 16.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, to 14.6% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating income Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $47.9 million, or 65%, to $121.5 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Within the Environmental Solutions Group, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $40.6 million, or 56%, with higher sales volumes, improved operating leverage and an incremental operating income contribution of $9.5 million from TBEI, associated with including a full-year of activity in 2018, compared to only seven months in 2017. TBEI’s operating income contribution in 2018 included the effects of amortization expense on intangible assets acquired, which contributed to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $6.9 million. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $7.1 million, or 26%, while corporate expenses decreased by $0.2 million, primarily driven by a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition and integration-related expenses, reductions in hearing loss litigation and post-employment expenses and the absence of $0.7 million in executive severance costs, partially offset by higher employee incentive and stock compensation costs. Consolidated operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 11.2%, compared to 8.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $2.0 million, or 27%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, largely due to higher average debt levels following the acquisition of TBEI in June 2017. 19 Other expense (income), net For the year ended December 31, 2018, Other expense (income), net, totaled $0.6 million of expense, largely due to foreign currency transaction losses and $0.4 million of net periodic pension expense. For the year ended December 31, 2017, $0.8 million of income was reported, largely due to foreign currency transaction gains, which were partially offset by $0.4 million of net periodic pension expense. Income tax expense The Company recognized income tax expense of $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to higher earnings, and the impact of certain special tax items in the year ended December 31, 2017, which did not repeat in 2018. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a tax benefit of $8.6 million associated with the completion of a tax planning strategy in Spain, which is expected to reduce cash tax payments in that jurisdiction over the next several years. Tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was lower than in 2018, largely due to the recognition of a $23.0 million net tax benefit associated with the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. following the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate included in the 2017 Tax Act. This benefit was partially offset by a $2.2 million net increase in valuation allowance, inclusive of a $3.0 million valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, the recognition of $0.6 million of additional tax expense associated with a change in the state tax rate in Illinois, and additional taxes resulting from higher pre-tax earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 16.0%, compared to 0.8% in 2017. The 2018 effective tax rate included the effects of the benefit from the tax planning strategy, whereas the 2017 effective tax rate included the aforementioned impacts resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. Income from continuing operations Income from continuing operations was $93.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $60.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, largely due to the improved operating income and the absence of $6.1 million in pension settlement charges incurred in the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by the $17.4 million increase in income tax expense, the $2.0 million increase in interest expense and the $1.4 million reduction in other income. Gain from discontinued operations and disposal, net of tax In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of $0.3 million, primarily due to adjustments of estimated product liability obligations of previously discontinued businesses, resulting from updated actuarial valuations. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net gain from discontinued operations and disposal of $1.1 million, primarily due to an adjustment of foreign tax credits associated with the sale of the Fire Rescue Group and adjustments of estimated product liability obligations of previously discontinued businesses, resulting from updated actuarial valuations. Orders & Backlog On the date of acquisition, MRL had a backlog of orders from its customers of $26.7 million. These acquired orders were included in total orders reported for the year ended December 31, 2019. On the date of acquisition, TBEI had a backlog of orders from its customers of $44.8 million. These acquired orders were included in total orders reported for the year ended December 31, 2017. 20 Year ended December 31, 2019 vs. year ended December 31, 2018 Total orders for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1,269.0 million, an increase of $95.8 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. The Environmental Solutions Group reported total orders of $1,038.0 million in 2019, an increase of $92.2 million, or 10%, compared to the prior year. The improvement was driven by incremental orders of $56.8 million related to the acquisition of MRL and organic growth of $35.4 million, or 4%, which was largely the result of improved orders for safe-digging trucks, refuse trucks, and dump truck bodies, as well as higher aftermarket demand, partially offset by reductions in orders for industrial vacuum loaders and trailers. Within the Safety and Security Systems Group, orders increased by $3.6 million, or 2%, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by improvements in orders for industrial signaling equipment.

Backlog was $357.6 million at December 31, 2019, up 15% compared to $310.3 million at December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to continued strong demand for sewer cleaners and safe-digging trucks, as well as higher orders for road-marking and line-removal equipment and refuse trucks. Year ended December 31, 2018 vs. year ended December 31, 2017 Total orders increased by $139.5 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. U.S. orders increased by $131.7 million, largely due to the 2017 acquisition of TBEI, which contributed an increase in orders of $64.4 million in a full-year in 2018. The organic growth in the U.S. of $67.3 million was largely driven by improvements in orders for vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners of $49.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket demand, representing orders for parts, service, used and rental equipment, improved by $9.3 million. Non-U.S. orders increased by $7.8 million, primarily due to improvements in orders for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners, street sweepers, and waterblasting equipment of $11.3 million, $6.8 million, $4.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket orders improved by $7.3 million. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $23.0 million decrease in refuse truck orders. Net sales increased by $170.9 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. U.S. sales increased by $167.4 million, or 31%, primarily due to the inclusion of five more months of TBEI results in 2018, accounting for $97.0 million of the sales increase, as well as increases in shipments of vacuum trucks and sewer cleaners of $37.9 million and $28.8 million, respectively. In addition, aftermarket revenues improved by $3.4 million, primarily represented by increased parts and service revenues and rental income. Non-U.S. sales increased by $3.5 million, or 2%, primarily due to a $12.4 million improvement in aftermarket revenue, represented by higher parts and service revenues, rental income and used equipment sales, as well as a $6.6 million increase in vacuum truck shipments. The acquisition of TBEI also contributed $1.1 million of incremental sales. Partially offsetting these improvements was a $16.1 million reduction in sales of products manufactured by other companies, such as refuse trucks. Cost of sales increased by $117.1 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily attributable to increased sales volumes, the effects of a full year of TBEI activity in 2018 compared with seven months in 2017, higher material costs and a $3.7 million increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in purchase accounting expenses. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to 22.9% from 20.8% in 2017, primarily due to improved operating leverage, benefits from pricing actions taken in response to higher commodity costs, favorable sales mix and the reduction in purchase accounting expenses, partially offset by the higher depreciation expense. SEG&A expenses increased by $13.2 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to the addition of expenses associated with the TBEI acquisition, including an increase in amortization expense of $3.2 million. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses decreased from 10.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017, to 9.7% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $40.6 million, or 56%, largely due to a $53.8 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $13.2 million increase in SEG&A expenses. Backlog was $310.3 million at December 31, 2018, up 34% compared to $231.1 million at December 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to the effects of improved demand for vacuum trucks, sewer cleaners and street sweepers in the U.S. 23 Safety and Security Systems The following table summarizes the Safety and Security Systems Group’s operating results as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 : Year ended December 31, 2019 vs. year ended December 31, 2018 Total orders increased by $3.6 million or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. U.S. orders increased by $0.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by improvements in orders for warning systems and industrial signaling equipment of $1.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in orders for public safety products. Non-U.S. orders increased by $3.5 million, or 4%, largely due to improvements in orders for industrial signaling equipment and public safety products of $5.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively, partially offset by a $4.7 million reduction in orders for warning systems and an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $3.0 million. Net sales increased by $2.4 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019. U.S. sales increased by $0.9 million, or 1%, primarily due to improvements in sales of industrial signaling equipment and warning systems of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, partially offset by a $1.5 million reduction in sales of public safety products. Non-U.S. sales increased by $1.5 million, or 2%, primarily due to improvements in sales of industrial signaling equipment and public safety products of $5.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $3.7 million reduction in sales of warning systems and an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.9 million. Cost of sales decreased by $3.5 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, largely due to favorable sales mix and a favorable foreign currency translation impact of $2.1 million, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019 improved to 39.5%, compared to 37.3% in the prior year, primarily due to benefits from pricing actions and improved sales mix in comparison to the prior year. SEG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.4 million, or 3%, higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased expenses associated with new product development and other growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses were 22.6% in the current year, compared to 22.2% in the prior year. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $4.5 million, or 13%, largely due to a $5.9 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by the $1.4 million increase in SEG&A expenses. Backlog was $29.3 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $27.4 million at December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to increased international orders for public safety products. Year ended December 31, 2018 vs. year ended December 31, 2017 Total orders increased by $15.7 million or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. In the aggregate, U.S. orders increased by $4.0 million, or 3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by increases in orders for public safety products and industrial products of $5.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a $3.0 million reduction in orders for outdoor warning systems. Non-U.S. orders increased by $11.7 million, or 16%, largely due to a $9.5 million increase in orders for public safety products, a $2.1 million favorable foreign currency translation impact, and a $0.6 million increase in orders for outdoor warnings systems, partially offset by a $0.5 million reduction in orders for industrial products. Net sales increased by $20.1 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2018. U.S. sales increased by approximately $5.8 million, primarily due to increases in sales of public safety and industrial products of $8.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Partially offsetting these increases was a $2.7 million reduction in sales of outdoor warning products. Non-U.S. 24 sales increased by $14.3 million, primarily driven by increases in sales of public safety products and outdoor warning systems of $7.5 million and $5.1 million, respectively, as well as a $1.7 million favorable foreign currency translation impact. Cost of sales increased by $13.0 million, or 10%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, largely due to higher sales volumes and an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $1.3 million. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 37.3%, compared to 37.5% in the year ended December 31, 2017. SEG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $0.6 million, or 1%, higher than the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to increased expenses associated with new product development and other growth initiatives. As a percentage of net sales, SEG&A expenses decreased from 24.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, to 22.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating income for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $7.1 million, or 26%, largely due to a $7.1 million increase in gross profit and a $0.6 million reduction in restructuring charges, partially offset by the $0.6 million increase in SEG&A expenses. Backlog was $27.4 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $26.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased orders for public safety products. Corporate Expense Corporate operating expenses were $30.9 million, $25.6 million and $25.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, corporate operating expenses increased by $5.3 million, primarily driven by higher post-employment expenses, employee-related costs and information technology investments. In addition, acquisition-related expenses increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to the acquisition of MRL. For the year ended December 31, 2018, corporate operating expenses decreased by $0.2 million, primarily driven by a $1.2 million decrease in acquisition and integration-related expenses, reductions in hearing loss litigation and post-employment expenses and the absence of $0.7 million in executive severance costs, partially offset by higher employee incentive and stock compensation costs. The Company’s hearing loss litigation has historically been managed by the Company’s legal staff resident at the corporate office and not by management at either segment. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, Segment Reporting, which provides that segment reporting should follow the management of the item and that certain expenses may be corporate expenses, these legal expenses (which are not part of the normal operating activities of any of our reportable segments) are reported and managed as corporate expenses. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company uses its cash flow from operations to fund growth and to make capital investments that sustain its operations, reduce costs, or both. Beyond these uses, remaining cash is used to pay down debt, repurchase shares, fund dividend payments and make pension contributions. The Company may also choose to invest in the acquisition of businesses. In the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, we believe that the Company’s existing cash balances, cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the 2019 Credit Agreement will provide funds sufficient for these purposes. The net cash flows associated with the Company’s rental equipment transactions are included in cash flow from operating activities. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $31.6 million, $37.4 million and $37.5 million as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, $13.8 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the U.S. typically are held in the currency of the country in which it is located. The Company uses this cash to fund the operating activities of its foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Generally, the Company has considered such cash to be permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company’s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund U.S. operations. However, in the event that these funds were needed to fund U.S. operations or to satisfy U.S. obligations, they generally could be repatriated. The repatriation of these funds may cause the Company to incur additional U.S. income tax expense, dependent on income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any such amounts were repatriated. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities totaled $103.4 million, $92.8 million and $73.5 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $10.6 million, or 11%, increase in cash generated by continuing operating activities in 2019 compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher earnings and a $7.0 million reduction in pension contributions. These improvements were partially offset by a $4.1 million increase in income tax payments, a $3.1 million increase in acquisition- 25 related activity, investments in working capital and rental fleet, as well as higher incentive compensation payments in comparison to the prior year. Net cash used for continuing investing activities totaled $84.4 million, $11.0 million and $277.1 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. In each of the years presented, cash was used to fund the purchase of properties and equipment, with $35.4 million, $14.1 million and $8.0 million of capital expenditures in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2019 was largely related to the expansion of the primary production facility of the Company’s Vactor Manufacturing, Inc. subsidiary. In addition, as discussed in Note 2 – Acquisitions, in 2019 the Company paid an initial $49.6 million to acquire MRL, net of cash acquired. In 2018, the Company received an adjustment for working capital and other post-closing items in the amount of $3.0 million relating to the TBEI acquisition, which was completed in 2017 for an initial payment of $269.2 million. In 2019, net cash of $24.6 million was used for continuing financing activities, compared with $81.2 million in 2018. In 2019, the Company’s net borrowings under its revolving credit facility increased by $7.4 million, primarily related to the funding of the acquisition of MRL. In addition, the Company funded payments of $10.3 million relating to acquisitions completed in 2016, paid cash dividends of $19.3 million, incurred $1.0 million of debt refinancing costs, repurchased $1.0 million of treasury stock and redeemed $2.1 million of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees’ minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation. In 2018, the Company repaid $62.1 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility, funded cash dividends of $18.7 million and repurchased $1.2 million of treasury stock. In 2017, in connection with the funding of the acquisition of TBEI, the Company borrowed $243.0 million against its revolving credit facility. Between the TBEI acquisition date and the end of 2017, approximately $34 million of net borrowings were repaid. In addition, the Company funded cash dividends of $16.8 million and redeemed $2.9 million of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees’ minimum tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation. On July 30, 2019, the Company entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement, by and among the Company (the “U.S. Borrower”) and certain of its foreign subsidiaries (collectively, the “Borrowers”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swingline lender and issuing lender, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as syndication agent, and the other lenders and parties signatory thereto. The 2019 Credit Agreement is a $500 million revolving credit facility, maturing on July 30, 2024, that provides for borrowings in the form of loans or letters of credit up to the aggregate availability under the facility, with a sub-limit of $75 million for letters of credit. The 2019 Credit Agreement allows for the Borrowers to borrow in denominations of U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros or British Pounds (with borrowings in non-U.S. currencies subject to a sublimit of $200 million ). In addition, the Company may cause the commitments to increase by up to an additional $250 million, subject to the approval of the applicable lenders providing such additional financing. Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company’s material domestic subsidiaries provide guarantees for all obligations of the Borrowers under the 2019 Credit Agreement, which is secured by a first priority security interest in (i) all existing or hereafter acquired domestic property and assets of the U.S. Borrower and material domestic subsidiaries, (ii) the stock or other equity interests in each of the material domestic subsidiaries and (iii) 65% of outstanding voting capital stock of certain first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exclusions. Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from zero to 0.75% for base rate borrowings and 1.00% to 1.75% for LIBOR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between 0.10% to 0.25% per annum on the unused portion of the $500 million revolving credit facility along with other standard fees. Letter of credit fees are payable on outstanding letters of credit in an amount equal to the applicable LIBOR margin plus other customary fees. The Company is subject to certain net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2019 Credit Agreement that are to be measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2019. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes a series of “covenant holiday” periods, which allow for the temporary increase of the minimum net leverage ratio following the completion of a permitted acquisition, or a series of acquisitions, when the aggregate consideration over a period of twelve months exceeds $75 million. In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement includes customary negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, restricting or limiting the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) make non-ordinary course dispositions of assets; (ii) make certain fundamental business changes, such as mergers, consolidations or any similar combination; (iii) make restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases; (iv) incur indebtedness; (v) make certain loans and investments; (vi) create liens; 26 (vii) transact with affiliates; (viii) enter into sale/leaseback transactions; (ix) make negative pledges; and (x) modify subordinated debt documents. Under the 2019 Credit Agreement, restricted payments, including dividends and stock repurchases, shall be permitted if (i) the Company’s leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.25; (ii) the Company is in compliance with all other financial covenants; and (iii) there are no existing defaults under the 2019 Credit Agreement. If its leverage ratio is more than 3.25, the Company is still permitted to fund (i) up to $35 million of dividend payments and stock repurchases; and (ii) an incremental $50 million of other cash payments. The 2019 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Borrowers may be required immediately to repay all amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Agreement and the commitments from the lenders may be terminated. The 2019 Credit Agreement amended and restated the Company’s Amended 2016 Credit Agreement, which provided the Company with a $400 million revolving credit facility. In connection with the execution of the 2019 Credit Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred $1.0 million of debt issuance costs. Such fees have been deferred and are being amortized over the five -year term. As of December 31, 2019, there was $219.9 million of cash drawn and $11.2 million of undrawn letters of credit under the 2019 Credit Agreement, with $268.9 million of net availability for borrowings. The following table summarizes the gross borrowings and gross payments under the Company’s revolving credit facilities: Aggregate maturities of total borrowings due amount to approximately $0.2 million in 2020, $0.2 million in 2021, $0.1 million in 2022, $0.1 million in 2023, and $219.9 million in 2024. The weighted average interest rate on long-term borrowings was 2.7% at December 31, 2019. The Company paid interest of $7.8 million in 2019, $8.7 million in 2018 and $6.6 million in 2017. The Company paid income taxes of $25.7 million in 2019, $21.6 million in 2018 and $13.9 million in 2017. Cash dividends of $19.3 million, $18.7 million and $16.8 million were declared and paid to stockholders in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for 2020, including investments associated with its ongoing plant expansions, will be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The Company believes that its financial resources and major sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity, will be adequate to meet its operating needs, capital needs and financial commitments. 27 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and payments due by period as of December 31, 2019 : (a) Amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on outstanding long-term debt. (b) Amounts include contractual obligations associated with lease arrangements that qualify for the short-term lease exception, discussed further in Note 4 – Leases to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (c) Purchase obligations primarily relate to commercial chassis and other contracts in the ordinary course of business. (d) The Company expects to contribute up to $6.9 million to the U.S. benefit plan and up to $1.3 million to the non-U.S. benefit plan in 2020, which represent the minimum required contributions. Future contributions to the plans will be based on such factors as (i) annual service cost, (ii) the financial return on plan assets, (iii) interest rate movements that affect discount rates applied to plan liabilities and (iv) the value of benefit payments made. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential future cash outflows associated with these plans, the Company is unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amounts and periods in which any additional liabilities might be paid. (e) Represents the fair value of the contingent earn-out payment associated with the acquisition of MRL. For further discussion, see Note 2 – Acquisitions to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. (f) As of December 31, 2019, the Company had a liability of approximately $1.3 million for unrecognized tax benefits. For further discussion, see Note 10 – Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters, the Company generally cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement for this liability. As such, the potential future cash outflows are not included in the table above. We do not expect any significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits as a result of potential expiration of statute of limitations and settlements with tax authorities. The following table summarizes the Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements and the notional amount by expiration period as of December 31, 2019 : (a) Financial standby letters of credit largely relate to casualty insurance policies for the Company’s workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability and product liability policies. Performance standby letters of credit primarily represent guarantees of performance of certain subsidiaries that engage in transactions with foreign customers. (b) Performance and bid bonds primarily relate to guarantees of performance of certain subsidiaries that engage in transactions with domestic and foreign customers. (c) Relates to certain transactions that the Company has entered into involving the sale of equipment to certain of its customers which included (i) guarantees to repurchase the equipment for a fixed price at a future date and (ii) guarantees to repurchase the equipment from the third-party lender in the event of default by the customer. For further discussion, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 28 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect (i) the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii) disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and (iii) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 31, 2019. In testing the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative or quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In this situation, the Company would not be required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below. A quantitative approach is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and no impairment charge is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, this difference is recorded as an impairment charge not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using both the income and market approaches. Under the income approach, the key assumptions include projected sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. These assumptions are determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan, including growth rates for revenues and operating expenses and margin assumptions. An additional key assumption under this approach is the discount rate, which is determined by reviewing current risk-free rates of capital and current market interest rates and by evaluating the risk premium relevant to the reporting unit. If the Company’s assumptions relative to growth rates were to change, the fair value calculation may change, which could result in impairment. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value using marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Similar to the income approach discussed above, sales, cost of sales, operating expenses and their respective growth rates are key assumptions utilized. The market prices of the Company’s common stock and other guideline companies are additional key inputs. If these market prices increase, the estimated market value would increase. Conversely, if market prices decrease, the estimated market value would decrease. The results of these two methods are weighted based upon management’s evaluation of the relevance of the two approaches. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from estimated financial results due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company also compares the sum of the estimated fair values of its reporting units to the overall fair value of the Company implied by its market capitalization. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company may also result in a conclusion that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value. Management applied the quantitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 2019 and used a combination of the income and market approaches to determine the fair value of its reporting units. The valuation was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist. One measure of the sensitivity of assumptions used in the impairment analysis is the amount by which each reporting unit “passed” (fair value exceeds the carrying value). The fair values of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than 20%, and, therefore, no impairment was recognized in 2019. Management applied the qualitative approach to assess the goodwill of its reporting units for potential impairment in 2018 and 2017 and concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the Company’s reporting units were less than their carrying values. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed. 29 The Company had no goodwill impairments in 2019, 2018 or 2017. Adverse changes to the Company’s business environment and future cash flow could cause us to record impairment charges in future periods, which could be material. See Note 8 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the Company’s goodwill by segment. Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets An intangible asset determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis at year-end, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset could be below its carrying amount. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets include trade names associated primarily with the MRL, TBEI, and JJE acquisitions that were completed in 2019, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In testing the indefinite-lived intangibles assets for potential impairment, the Company applies either a qualitative test, or a quantitative test, in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. A qualitative approach may be applied when the Company concludes that it is not “more likely than not” that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying value. A quantitative impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value. Significant judgment is applied when evaluating whether an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life and in testing for impairment. The Company primarily uses the relief from royalty model to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. The relief from royalty model requires management to make a number of business and valuation assumptions including future revenue growth and royalty rates. In 2019, the Company performed a combination of qualitative and quantitative impairment tests over its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets that were quantitatively tested for impairment significantly exceeded their carrying value, and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. This valuation was prepared by a third-party valuation specialist. Further, the Company concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets that were qualitatively tested for impairment were less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed. The Company applied the qualitative approach to assess its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in 2018 and 2017 and concluded that it was not “more likely than not” that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amounts. Accordingly, further quantitative testing was not required to be performed. The Company had no indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments in 2019, 2018 or 2017. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from estimated financial results due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the assets and potentially result in different impacts to the Company’s results of operations. Actual results may differ from the Company’s estimates. See Note 8 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally this occurs at a point in time, with the transfer of control of the Company’s products or services to customers. For most of the Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped; however, occasionally control passes later or earlier than shipment due to customer contract or letter of credit terms. In circumstances where credit is extended, payment terms generally range from 30 to 120 days and customer deposits may be required. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring products or providing services. Expected returns and allowances are estimated and recognized based primarily on an analysis of historical experience, with Net sales presented net of such returns and allowances. The Company enters into sales arrangements that may provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. These arrangements may include software and non-software components that function together to deliver the products’ essential functionality. The Company identifies all performance obligations that are to be delivered separately under the sales arrangement and allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company 30 uses an observable price to determine the standalone selling price or a cost plus margin approach when one is not available. In general, performance obligations include hardware, integration and installation services. The allocated revenue for each performance obligation is recognized as such performance obligations are satisfied. Net sales include sales of products and billed freight related to product sales. Freight has not historically comprised a material component of Net sales. The Company has elected to account for such shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are recorded on a net basis and are excluded from Net sales. Income Taxes We estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items, such as the timing for recognizing expenses, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities, which are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, will be realizable in future years. Future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Possible sources of taxable income include taxable income in carryback periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income or gains in excess of anticipated losses in the carryforward period and projected future taxable income. If, based upon all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. Significant weight is given to positive and negative evidence that is objectively verifiable. A company’s three-year cumulative loss position is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable and the accounting guidance restricts the amount of reliance the Company can place on projected taxable income to support the recovery of the deferred tax assets. We continually evaluate the need to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized through the generation of future taxable income. Appropriate consideration is given to all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A high degree of judgment is required to determine if, and the extent that, valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company determined that $0.8 million of valuation allowance, previously recorded against state deferred tax assets, could be released primarily as a result of an increase to future taxable income expected to be generated in certain states. At December 31, 2019, the total valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets was $8.2 million, comprised of a $4.2 million valuation allowance recorded against state net operating loss carryforwards, a $0.9 million valuation allowance recorded against foreign net deferred tax assets, and a $3.1 million valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s foreign tax credits. For further discussion related to valuation allowances and other tax matters, refer to Note 10 – Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 31 Item 7A.
