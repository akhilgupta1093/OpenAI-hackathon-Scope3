RT-IG-410a. 2 Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for  
non-road equipmentGallons per hour Due to the diversity of applications 
of our non-road products, we do not 
calculate sales-weighted fuel
efficiency for non-road equipment. 
Nor do we calculate NOx and PM 
emissions on a sales-weighted 
basis. We continue to expand our 
offering of hybrid and electric
vehicles. For more information on 
sustainable products, see pages

Report.RT-IG-410a. 4 Sales-weighted emissions of: (1) nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and (2) particulate matter 
(PM) for: (a) marine diesel engines, (b) 
locomotive diesel engines, (c) non-road
