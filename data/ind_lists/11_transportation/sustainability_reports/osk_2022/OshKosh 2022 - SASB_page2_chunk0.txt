In 2021 the EPA changed the GEM 
model used to calculate fuel 
economy and emissions. The 
change in the calculation from the 
EPA changed the value this year. The 
distribution and characteristics of 
the trucks in scope were essentially 
the same as last year. 
Note: The data shared reflects 
trucks Oshkosh builds from the 
frame up (S-Series, P-Series, and all
Pierce fire trucks). Defense vehicles 
are built under the national security 
exemption and no data is included. 
Commercial vehicles built from 
chassis built by other companies 
are not included
