Critical material will always be available; however, it may experience price
volatility depending on supply and demand. Oshkosh Corporationâ€™s 
purchasing strategy is to recognize changes in market behavior and 
consider buying strategic inventories, lead time reduction and long term 
agreements. Oshkosh Corporation works hard to source product and
materials ethically and utilizes controls to partner with our global supply 
chain to identify and control the use of critical materials.
