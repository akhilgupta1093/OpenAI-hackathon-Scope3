• New tools will enable us to trace parts and subsystems more precisely to vehicle-specific builds when an issue arises, rather than issuing wider recalls targeting a date range of vehicle identification numbers, which generally involve broad vehicle populations that may not all be affected. 
•We continue to improve investigation tracking anddealer engagement processes. Using an integrateddata management system, we will soon be able tomonitor all stages of a quality investigation. This willlead to faster decisions, improved parts availability,and global sharing of best practice solutions
