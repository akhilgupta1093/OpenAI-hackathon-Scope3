We will lead the electrification revolution. 
We are bringing electrification from the niche to the ma
instream, electrifying our icons, including F-150 
Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and Lincoln, and rapidly scaling up production and improving affordability. Weâ€™re investing $5 0 billion  from 2022 through 2026 
in ele
ctric vehicles (EVs), EV technology and charging 
infrastructure to remove obstacles and show customers the clear advantages of electric vehicles. 
From sustainability to performance to power and digital 
int
egration, Ford is creating capacity, capability, and 
convenience in our vehicles that were never possible before. And by working to close the loop on battery manufacturing, we can reduce emissions and even packaging. Through our focus on battery recycling, we will re-use valuable materials, recover precious metals, and help make electric vehicles more affordable. 
We are expanding our capabilities to advance mobility
