Our Material Matters
Ford manages and tackles a range of sustainability issues. When it comes 
to effective and strategic sustainability reporting, we must decide on what information is most important and to whom. Our materiality assessment helps us identify, refine, and assess key environmental, social, and governance issues to inform our corporate sustainability strategy and reporting. 
Our Materiality Process
We conduct materiality assessments every two years, an
d carried out our most recent analysis in early 2021. 
We consider material information to be of greatest interest to our stakeholders, so they can make informed decisions and judgments about the company’s commitment to environmental, social, and economic progress
