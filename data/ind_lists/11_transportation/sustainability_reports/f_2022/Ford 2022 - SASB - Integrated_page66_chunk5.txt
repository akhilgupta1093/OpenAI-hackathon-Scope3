A growing element in our due diligence efforts, the SAQ 
is a
ligned with the Supplier Code of Conduct, and as such 
is used to assess supplier sustainability and to support Ford in identifying social and environmental risks throughout our supply base. 
We are in the process of scaling the SAQ to our entire 
pr
oduction supply base with the goal of 100% response 
rate, enabling us to verify that supplier policies and practices meet the standard of our Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2022, we are planning to use this information to integrate sustainability into our sourcing decisions
