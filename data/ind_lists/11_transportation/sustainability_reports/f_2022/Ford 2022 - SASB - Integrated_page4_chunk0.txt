Letter from Bill Ford 
and Jim Farley
For all of us at Ford, the truest mark of success is whether we leave the world  
a better place for the next generation. From our earliest days to the present day, 
Ford has followed that north star. 
We invented the moving assembly line and the 
$5 workday, scaled the Model T, forged the Arsenal of Democracy, and converted our 
plants to make ventilators and masks during the pandemic. Each generation faces different challenges, but our purpose has always been the same: to help build a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams
