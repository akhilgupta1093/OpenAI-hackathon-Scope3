We continued to turn around our automotive operations 
and e
nsure Ford is competing to win in our areas of 
strength. We added exciting products to our lineup including the new Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick, and Mustang Mach-E â€“ and announced new vehicles like the E-Transit, F-150 Lightning, and the next generation Ranger. 
Our operations outside of North America collectively 
pos
ted their best results since 2017, largely driven by 
the success of our Global Redesign efforts. We have drastically de-risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, including restructuring our business in India, and have vastly improved our earnings and cash generation power in the process. 
We began to bring our vision of always-on experiences 
for re
tail and commercial customers to life, delivering 
over-the-air updates and fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford and driving the definition of next generation of connected vehicles
