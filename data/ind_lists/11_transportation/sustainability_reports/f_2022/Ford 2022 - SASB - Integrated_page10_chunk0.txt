Ford Motor Company has a long 
history as an automotive and sustainability pioneer. 
Doing the right thing is in our DNA. Bill Ford 
himself is a passionate environmental leader and has spearheaded Fordâ€™s sustainability efforts for over two decades.

And we have done this while continuing to deliver the iconic vehicles and rewarding experiences people expect from Ford
