à Engaging With EmployeesEmployee engagement is vital to advancing our inclusive cult
ure. We foster dialogue with our employees at all 
levels of the business through channels including: our intranet site and website; corporate publications and reports; social media; webcasts and executive Q&A sessions with senior management; labor-management committee meetings; regular “Global Town Hall” meetings with direct updates from senior leaders; and Employee Resource Group (ERG) initiatives. We heard from thousands of employees throughout the year, giving us a significant insight into where we have done well and where we need to apply more focus. In 2021, 87% of employees surveyed, which were primarily salaried employees, stated that they have the flexibility to balance the needs of their work and personal life. Employee responses also indicate that employees are excited about what Ford can accomplish in the future.Our efforts to build inclusive work environments and foste
r a culture of belonging in our U.S. manufacturing 
facilities is ongoing. In 2021, Culture Managers in Chicago, Kentucky, Kansas City and the Rouge implemented the Manufacturing Culture Playbook, which provides a framework for plant leaders to assess their work environments with the purpose of building plant-specific actions that anticipate, prevent, or address issues and sustain positive cultures. By mid 2022, all plants in the U.S. and Canada will be supported by a Culture Manager. 
For more than two decades, Ford’s Employee Resource
