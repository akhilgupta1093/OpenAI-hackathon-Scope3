We use warranty repairs as a key metric to measure 
initial quality, but go beyond warrantable items alone and include measures of customer excitement to measure our products. 
We use the Quality Net Promoter Score (QNPS), which 
measur
es the ownership experience at three, 12 and 36 
months in service. QNPS provides a comprehensive and holistic view of quality by capturing both customers’ “dislikes” and “likes” (e.g., “Things Gone Right”). This new tool will give us more timely, actionable insights that align with various industry performance indicators of quality, such as the annual studies conducted by J.D.
