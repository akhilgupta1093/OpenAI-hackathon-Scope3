We believe that key success factors in the risk ma
nagement at Ford include a strong risk analysis tone 
set by the Board and senior management, which is shown through their commitment to effective top-down and bottom-up communication (including communication between management and the Board and Committees), and active cross-functional participation among the Business Units and Functional Skill Teams. 
We have institutionalized a regular Forecast, Controls and 
Ri
sk Review and Special Attention Review process where 
the senior leadership of the Company reviews the status of the business, the risks, and opportunities presented to the business (in the areas of compliance, reporting, operating, and strategic risks), and develops specific plans to address those risks and opportunities
