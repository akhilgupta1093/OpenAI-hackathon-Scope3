Workforce Stability:  Our ongoing success depends on 
o
ur ability to continue to recruit and retain a talented 
and diverse workforce that is highly skilled in engineering, 
software, technology, and other areas. Global competition for such talent is intense, with potential employees increasingly placing a premium on various intangibles, such as working for companies with a clear purpose, flexible work arrangements, and other considerations, and the loss of existing employees or an inability to recruit new employees could have an adverse effect on our business. Changes needing us to accelerate our ability to reskill, upskill and better develop our employees to complete our transformation to electrification also contributes to risk.Macroeconomic, Market and Strategic RisksMarket Competition:  Our products and services are 
su
bject to market acceptance as well as competition 
from other players in the automotive, mobility, and digital services industries. Although we conduct extensive market research before launching a vehicle or service, many factors within and outside our control can affect their success. For example, a shift in consumer preferences away from larger, more profitable ICE vehicles, due to rising fuel prices, a decline in the construction industry, or government actions or incentives, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations in the near term
