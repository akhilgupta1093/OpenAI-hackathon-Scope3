Sue:  Yes, by design, our collaboration with Redwood 
h
elps ensure that recyclable materials in battery 
production scrap and end-of-life products re-enter the 
supply chain and don’t wind up in landfills. Doing that helps reduce our reliance on the existing commodities supply chain that could be quickly overwhelmed by industry demand. That leads us into our aspirational goal to responsibly sourcing our raw materials. Moving toward t
he need for more batteries, it is more critical than ever 
that we maintain our sensitivity to how natural resources are used in our manufacturing process by conserving water, energy and raw materials and looking at alternative sources that we can use, so that we’re not so concentrated forward. 
Lisa:  We’re also focused on vertical integration in our EV 
m
anufacturing and ramping up research and development 
in batteries with the launch of Ford Ion Park, as an 
example. BlueOval City in Tennessee, will become a vertically integrated ecosystem for Ford to assemble the next generation of electric F-Series trucks and will include a BlueOval SK battery plant, key suppliers and recycling. Our new assembly plant at BlueOval City is designed to be carbon neutral and to send zero waste to landfill once fully operational. This is all part of our focus on innovation and sustainable growth. The investments we’re making today will help us lead the electric revolution at scale, and in a way that has positive impacts on people and the planet
