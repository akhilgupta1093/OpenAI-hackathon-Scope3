Respecting Human Rights
Our commitment to respecting human 
righ
ts is unwavering. 
Ford’s commitment to human rights was evident when 
Henry Ford introduced the $5 workday in 1914, launching the company’s effort to democratize mobility and help create the middle class. This commitment stems from our purpose of helping to build a better world for all, and continues to guide our decision-making and actions both today and in the future. As we remain focused on respecting and supporting human rights within the company, we are also working with our suppliers and business partners to do the same. 
Formally committing to respecting human rights through 
our po
licy, We Are Committed to Protecting Human 
Righ
ts and the Environment, we are also dedicated to 
a broa
der aspect of human rights – having a positive 
impact on the health, safety, and wellbeing of the
