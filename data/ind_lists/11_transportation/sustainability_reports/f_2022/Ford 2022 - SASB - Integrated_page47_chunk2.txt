Research Goal: Recharging EVs as Quickly  
as Ga
s Fill-ups 
Ford researchers have successfully completed an early stepin col
laboration with Purdue University: we have invented 
a new, patent-pending method for charging stations that could one day deliver significantly more power compared to today’s leading systems.  
Using liquid as an active cooling agent, the concept uniq
uely changes the liquid to vapor and could combine 
with in-development vehicle charging technology to lower the average time to recharge electric vehicles. This innovation could one day deliver significantly more power to charge electric vehicles than today’s leading systems, making possible faster re-charging times if vehicle charging and other technology enhancements are made in parallel. Ultimately, this could lead to re-charging EVs as quickly as conventional gas station fill-ups
