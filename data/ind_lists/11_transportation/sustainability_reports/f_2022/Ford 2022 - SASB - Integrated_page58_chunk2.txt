DEI Education and Inspiration 
The global DEI audits also uncovered varying levels of awa
reness and understanding, which can impact empathy 
and employees’ ability to relate to others’ experiences. This is why we are investing heavily in opportunities for learning and education. Our DEI Learning Strategy follows the sequence: Creating Awareness, Deepening Our Understanding, and Leading with Action. 
We increased traditional learning opportunities, with 
cou
rses including Women Rising, Understanding 
Systemic Racism, and Men as Allies. Significant learning resources are also available on demand on the Degreed interactive learning platform. Degreed offers all Ford salaried employees diverse lea
rning opportunities for professional and personal 
development. The curated educational resources (over 250,000 courses and 3 million articles/videos) cover numerous topics, including many dimensions of diversity, equity, and inclusion and allow for a self-guided learning approach. The DEI Learning Plan on Degreed is designed to meet people where they are on their DEI journey and provide a space to create awareness, deepen understanding, and lead with action to cultivate a culture of belonging for all. As of the end of January, we have 52,670 total users in the platform
