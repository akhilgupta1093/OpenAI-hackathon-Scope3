Human Rights in Our Supply Chain
Our commitment to human rights extends to our supply 
chain. Ford’s supply chain sustainability strategy is to build supply base capacity that exceeds minimum regulatory compliance requirements and creates shared business value. 
In 2021 we established a formal Supplier Code of Conduct
 
that applies clear requirements and expectations for 
all Ford suppliers in areas related to human rights, the environment, responsible material sourcing and responsible business practices. Available in eight languages, the new Supplier Code requires all suppliers globally to enforce a similar code of practice and for subcontractors to do the same. 
The Supplier Code of Conduct is incorporated within 
Fo
rd’s Global Terms and Conditions. In 2022, we are 
planning to integrate sustainability metrics into our production sourcing decisions to support supplier 
eng
agement and performance improvement.
