Collaborating for the Safe Deployment  
of Autonomous Vehicles
Ford continues to collaborate with others testing autonomous vehicle technologies within several business associations, as well as lawmakers, regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, Ford participates in various consortiums addressing the safety challenges autonomous vehicles face through the development of industry best practices and standards. Some of Ford’s collaborative efforts include: 
AMP – Ford has joined with other autonomous vehicle 
de
velopers in the U.S., to form the Automated Mobility 
Partnership (AMP), which is geared towards the use of real-world driving data to inform the development of automated driving systems.AVSC – Ford is a founding member of the Autonomous Ve
hicle Safety Consortium (AVSC), convened by the 
SAE International and SAE Industry Technologies Consortia (SAE ITC). This consortium is working together to advance safer testing, development, and deployment of autonomous vehicles through the establishment of industry best practices. The following AVSC best practices have been developed and released to date: Fallback Test Driver, Operational Design Domain, Passenger-Initiated Emergency Trip Interruption, Data Collection, First Responder Interactions, Metrics and Methods for Assessing Safety Performance, Adapting a Safety Management System (SMS) for ADS Testing and Evaluation, and Evaluation of Behavioral Competencies.PAVE – The Partners for Automated Vehicle Education (P
AVE) coalition is dedicated to educating the public 
about automated vehicles and the increased safety, mobility, and sustainability benefits they can provide
