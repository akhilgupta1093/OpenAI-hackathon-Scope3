This is a transformative moment where Ford 
will lead America’s transition to electric vehicles and usher in a new era of clean, carbon-neutral manufacturing. With this investment and a spirit of innovation, we can achieve goals once thought mutually exclusive – protect our planet, build great electric vehicles Americans will love, and contribute to our nation’s prosperity.”
Bill Ford, Executive Chair Overview
Everything we are doing – investing in 
electrification, enhancing connectivity, and developing new products and services – is to revolutionize and enrich the customer experience. 
Our approach is deeply rooted in customer insights, and 
we are creating an ecosystem around our products that drives deep loyalty. The foundation is our purpose – delivered through our Ford+ strategy – to help build a better world, in which every person is free to move and pursue their dreams
