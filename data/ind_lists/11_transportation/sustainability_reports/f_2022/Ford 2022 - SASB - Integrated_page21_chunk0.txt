A Conversation

Sue SlaughterPurchasing Director, Supply Chain and Sustainability
Lisa:  Throughout our business, we’ve all been impacted 
in some way by the global pandemic. We – along with 
the rest of the industry – have been dealing with a global semiconductor shortage that was accelerated by COVID-19. It is forcing us to rethink the way we operate and make changes to the supply chain so that it is more simple, flexible, and quicker to react when problems arise. Sue, how has purchasing navigated through this situation? 
Sue:  We are working together with our suppliers to ensure 
w
e have the supply we need to meet demand. And as we 
continue to integrate technology and digitally-enabled 
services into our vehicles, our need for computing power driven by things like chips, has gone up. We saw a similar challenge in our supply of critical materials as well. That is why it is so important that we not only think about how Ford can use our purchasing power to fuel our business needs, but also to advance our focus on sustainability
