Local D&I Committees are made up of hourly

Additionally hourly and salary employees are trained on in-depth D&I topics, on an annual basis, in order to provide updated material and train newly appointed committee members. The National D&I committee certifies over 70 UAW and salaried employees, many of whom are Local D&I Committee members, to train new manufacturing employees as part of the onboarding program about the importance of D&I topics including the UAW-Ford commitment and behaviors critical to creating a respectful workplace
