Global Safety Ratings
Ford continues to receive high marks and accolades in pub
lic and private crash testing assessments. However, 
New Car Assessment Programs (NCAPs) vary widely with differing protocols and evaluation criteria, and are continually updated. Consequently, it is increasingly difficult to achieve top ratings across all regions. Nonetheless, we are proud that so many of our vehicles have received 5-star ratings globally, and we continue to place considerable emphasis on our performance in these assessments
