Ford is publishing a Human Rights Report – a first for 
th
e company and for our industry. It will examine how 
our materials are sourced, where our products are manufactured, and how our labor standards measure up. Countries around the world are defining access to clean air and water as fundamental human rights. We at Ford agree – and are setting clear targets for reducing the global emissions of our entire supply chain. 
Whenever the world faces disruption and uncertainty, 
Fo
rd has stepped up to shape it for the better. We are at 
our best when we are creating something larger than ourselves. In this time of profound change, we will answer the call to lead our industry towards a more sustainable future, while giving our customers the very best of Ford
