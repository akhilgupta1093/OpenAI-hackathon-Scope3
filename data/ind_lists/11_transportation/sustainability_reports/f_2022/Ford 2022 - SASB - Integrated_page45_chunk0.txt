In central Kentucky, we will build a dedicated battery 
manufacturing complex called the BlueOval SK Battery Park with SK On, a wholly owned subsidiary of partner SK Innovation focused on the battery business. Twin battery plants on the site, as well as one in Tennessee, are intended to supply Ford’s North American assembly plants with locally assembled batteries for powering next generation electric Ford and Lincoln vehicles. Three plants will be capable of producing up to 129 gigawatt hours annually, which will be expanded by mid-decade to 141 gigawatt hours, enough to build more than one million electric vehicles. 
Our investment in BlueOval City in Tennessee and the 
Bl
ueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky sets a new standard 
for scale, sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training for the next generation of technology leaders. 
After investing $ 7 billion  in Michigan since 2016, and 
co
mmitting $70 0 million  for the Rouge Electric Vehicle 
Center a year ago, we are investing an additional 
$25 0 million  across the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, 
Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center, and Rawsonville Components Plant to help increase production capacity of the F-150 Lightning to 150,000 trucks a year. 
We are also collaborating with Redwood Materials, a 
le
ading battery materials company, to make electric 
vehicles more sustainable and affordable for Americans by localizing the supply chain network, creating recycling options for scrap and end-of-life batteries, and ramping up lithium-ion recycling. We believe battery recycling is essential for the success of an electrified future and has the potential to offer significant economic benefits
