That’s why Ford is acting now to produce no-compromise 
el
ectric vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning 
and E-Transit. And it’s why we’re aiming to reach carbon neutrality no later than 2050, by reducing emissions from our operations and throughout our entire supply chain, while pushing the boundaries of innovation and technology. 
We’re reimagining how EVs – and the batteries that 
p
ower them – are designed, manufactured, and recycled, 
creating an all-new electric vehicle manufacturing ecosystem. We’re also working closely with our suppliers, from factories to mines for raw materials, to both reduce carbon emissions and help the people and communities around them thrive. 
We are building a more equitable and inclusive business 
t
hrough our focus on making a positive impact. Through 
our community engagements we are making lives better. And we are building a culture where everyone feels they belong. We are committed to leadership in human rights and the environment in every single part of our business, because fulfilling our purpose depends on it. Our Strategies
