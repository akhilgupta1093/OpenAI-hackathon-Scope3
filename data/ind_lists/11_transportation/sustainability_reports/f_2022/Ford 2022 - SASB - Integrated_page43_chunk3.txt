As part of this effort, Ford joined RouteZero, a global 
coa
lition working towards all sales of new cars and 
vans being zero emission vehicles by 2040 globally, and no later than 2035 in leading markets â€“ to curb global warming. 
In addition to electrifying vehicles in high-volume 
seg
ments, another key component of our strategy is to 
ensure access to lower-cost, high-performing battery technology and create a closed loop manufacturing system. Through Ford Pro, we will also help small and large businesses globally transition their fleets to zero emission vehicles by providing a suite of support, including EV consulting, charging, telematics, service, and financing
