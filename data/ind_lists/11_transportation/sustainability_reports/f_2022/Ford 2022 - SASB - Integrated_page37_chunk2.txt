Ceres Recommendation: 
Support strong fuel economy standards for model year (
MY) 2027 through MY 2030. 
Ford Response: We believe that climate change is a shared global c
hallenge that affects all of us. Ford has strengthened 
its support for commitments to limit global temperature increases consistent with the Paris Agreement. Ford seeks to achieve carbon neutrality globally no later than 2050 across our vehicles, suppliers, and facilities, and we have set out a strategic path to accelerate our progress, backed by science-based targets. Ford is the only full-line U.S. automaker committed to doing its part to reduce CO
2 
emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and working with California for stronger vehicle GHG standards. Ford supports EPA’s proposals to increase the stringency of fuel economy standards, which intend to deliver similar GHG reductions as the California Framework Agreement. Ceres Recommendation: Provide more information about the full lifecycle 
im
pact of vehicles. 
Ford Response: Automobiles are among the world’s most recycled c
onsumer products. Over 85% of vehicle parts and 
materials are actually recycled and reused at their end of life
