Reporting Violations 
Our compliance program facilitates the confidential reporting of known or potential violations of the law or of our policies. Our people can report violations directly to Human Resources or the Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Office as well as the Office of the General Counsel or the General Auditorsâ€™ Office. Violations can also be reported using the SpeakUp reporting mechanism, telephone hotlines, websites, or email, some of which allow for anonymous reporting. External stakeholders may report by emailing SpeakUp@ford.com . Allegations are reviewed by a cross-functional committee, which oversees any investigations and subsequent corrective or disciplinary action
