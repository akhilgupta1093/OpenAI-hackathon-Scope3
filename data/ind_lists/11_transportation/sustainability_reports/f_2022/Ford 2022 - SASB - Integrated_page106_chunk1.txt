The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing compliance and reporting risk. The Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing environmental and social sustainability risks, while the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing risks related to compensation and people-related business strategies, including leadership succession and culture, diversity, and inclusion. The Board and the appropriate committees also periodically review other policies related to personnel matters, including those related to sexual harassment and anti-retaliation policies related to whistleblowers. The Board, the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee, the Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Audit Committee all play a role in overseeing operating and strategic risk management.The scope and severity of risks presented by cyber threats have increased dramatically, and constant vigilance is required to protect against intrusions. We take cyber threats very seriously and regularly audit our cyber security capabilities. These audits are a useful tool for ensuring that we maintain a robust cyber security program to protect our investors, customers, employees, and intellectual property. The Audit Committee receives updates several times per year from the Chief Information Security Officer regarding technology and cyber security risk and conducts regular reviews of our cyber security practices, with report outs to the Board as appropriate. As part of its risk assessment procedures, the Board reviews relevant cyber security and information technology matters at least twice annually
