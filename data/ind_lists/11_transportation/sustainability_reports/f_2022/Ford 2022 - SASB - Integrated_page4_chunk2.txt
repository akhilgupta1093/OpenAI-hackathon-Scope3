Climate change, for example, is among the biggest 
ch
allenges of our generation. We all share the 
responsibility to address the threat it poses our economy, our health, and our way of life. Just like the Model T revolutionized mobility, we believe electrification can do the same for reducing carbon emissions. So, we have been transforming our business to lead the electric revolution at scale, creating distinct but complementary businesses – Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro – that will help us compete and win in the new era of electric and connected vehicles.We are introducing all-electric versions of our most po
pular, iconic nameplates – the F-150 Lightning, the 
Mustang Mach-E, and the E-Transit van – and scaling production to reach a target of producing more than 2 million  electric vehicles per year by 2026. We are also 
leading a new era of sustainable manufacturing, re-thinking not just what we build, but how we build. In Tennessee and Kentucky, we have made the largest one-time U.S. investment by any automotive manufacturer to construct the most sustainable manufacturing facilities in our history. Around the world, we are dedicating more than $5 0 billion  through 2026 to accelerate our zero-
emission vehicle plan and create an ultra-efficient manufacturing system for our vehicles and the batteries that power them, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Our aspiration is to achieve a business model that goes beyond net-zero and becomes a net-positive for both the environment and the economy
