Safety Recalls:  Government safety standards require 
m
anufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle 
safety through safety recall campaigns. Our vehicles 
could be affected by defects that result in delays in launches, recall campaigns, or increased warranty costs.Reliance on Suppliers:  We depend on our complex 
g
lobal supply chain to deliver components for our 
vehicles. Our products contain components sourced from suppliers that, in turn, source components from their suppliers. A shortage of key components, such as the semiconductor shortage, can disrupt the production of vehicles. 
Cybersecurity Risks:  As we develop and produce 
v
ehicles with increased connectivity, operating, and 
security systems are more at risk from potential 
disruptions. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including in-vehicle systems and mobile devices to process, transmit, and store vital data. Despite data privacy and security measures, we are at risk of outages, cyberattacks, security breaches, or natural events, all of which could impact operational systems, compromise sensitive or personal information, or negatively affect the performance and safety of our vehicles
