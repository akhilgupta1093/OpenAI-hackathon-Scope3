At Ford, we are proud of being 
a trusted company, known for acting with integrity. Last year, we modernized and simplified Ford’s Code of Conduct to build upon this trust and increase transparency around what it means to work at or with Ford. We’ve made understanding and demonstrating our values easier than ever before.” 
Beth Rose, 
Chief Compliance, Ethics and Integrity Officer Overview 
With our capacity to adapt to change, our 
business can meet new challenges and goals, not only to create value for our stakeholders, but to do so ethically – to maintain our long-term viability and accountability as a trusted international business partner leading the next revolution in transportation under the Ford+ umbrella. 
Through our electrification, mobility, connectivity, and 
sustainability strategies, we are transitioning to a model that emphasizes services, relationships, renewable resources, and human and social capital. Creating value responsibly and ethically – building trust in al
l we do – spurs this transformation, helping us drive 
progress and make positive impacts to meet the collective challenges the world faces across a range of sustainability issues. 
In fact, we are actively working to build a better world, 
with fewer obstacles and limits, so that everyone has the
 
opportunity to pursue their dreams. We know that trust earned with global stakeholders will be our most important asset in dealing with the critical issues covered in this report, including transparency and ethics, global data analytics, privacy and protection, government regulations and policy, and corporate governance and engagement.
