Pro Trailer Hitch Assist
TM
Available Pro Trailer Hitch Assist helps you to hook up 
your trailer more easily by automatically controlling the steering wheel, throttle, and braking to align the hitch ball and trailer coupler. All the driver needs to do is hold down a button and control the gears. The driver is then alerted to help ensure that the coupler is high enough to clear the hitch ball. Once the two are aligned, the truck stops and you lower the trailer onto the tow ball.Smart Hitch
Available Smart Hitch is designed to help you easily load t
railers and practice safe towing. Smart Hitch measures 
the tongue weight of a trailer being connected to help the customer distribute trailer weight correctly. After the trailer is set up in the center touch screen, Smart Hitch calculates its appropriate tongue weight and provides guidance on weight distribution or hitch overloading on the screen or on the FordPass App. The truck will indicate if the current hitch weight is too high or low, and can even guide owners through properly tensioning a weight-redistributing hitch.Bringing Collision Avoidance Into View We are building on a long-standing relationship with M
