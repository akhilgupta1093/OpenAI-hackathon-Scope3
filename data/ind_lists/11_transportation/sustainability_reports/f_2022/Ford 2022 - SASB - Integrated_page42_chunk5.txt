To achieve this, we are increasing our planned global 
inve
stment in EVs, including battery production, to 
$50 billion  from 2022 through 2026. This will allow us 
to rapidly scale production capacity of our popular new electric vehicles to more than 600,000 by the end of 2023 â€“ and grow that to an annual run rate of 2 million  by 
2026 when BlueOval City in Tennessee comes onstream. By then, electric vehicles will represent one-third of our global volume, growing to half by 2030
