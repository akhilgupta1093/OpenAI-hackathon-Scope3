Lisa:  That’s right. Part of our focus on ensuring a 
r
esponsible and ethical supply chain is making sure that 
we are partnering with other businesses, suppliers, 
organizations and coalitions that have the same standards and commitments to a sustainable future as we do at Ford. There are so many aspects that come with that – from protecting the environment to respecting human rights and setting science-based targets towards carbon n
eutrality, for example. 
Sue:  Everything we make and everything that goes into 
o
ur products throughout the supply chain must comply 
with not only local laws, but also follow our commitment to sustainability. And a company with the scale that Ford has can really influence the supply chain and business practices across our entire industry. Our membership with IRMA – the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance – is an example of this. When we joined IRMA, it was our commitment to consistently achieving that goal by forwarding best practices.. We were the first automaker to join IRMA, so we’re leading change within our industry and more broadly across industries with similarly aligned priorities to make progress
