Ford+ Behaviors 
The Ford+ Behaviors embedded in the Ford+ Plan are 
critical to helping us transform and win. If the Ford+ Plan outlines what we will do to change our business for the future, the Ford+ Behaviors are how our team members will work differently to seize this moment and write the next 100 years of Ford’s legacy. They were developed with the input of more than 10,000 employees who helped further define what our behaviors mean in practice at Ford. 
To deliver Ford+ and radically transform Ford from a 
tra
ditional automaker to a business that builds lifelong, 
always-on customer relationships requires each and every member of our global team to work differently and adopt a Challenger Mindset. We are committed to helping our employees put these behaviors into action and are evolving our onboarding and up-skilling processes to cultivate exceptional talent across every level of the organization. We are also focused on recognizing and celebrating our Ford+ Champions, the employees who are embodying our behaviors and driving our transformation, through peer-driven storytelling and recognition programs. 
Leadership+ 
When all of our teams are operating at their best, Ford can build a better world. Recognizing the power of our leaders in enabling our future, in 2021 we established Leadership+, our mechanism for delivering key messages and activations to elevate and add clarity to the role of a people leader. Leadership+ sets leaders up for success in their role as Ford+ activators and change agents by: 
•Building understanding of Ford+ and the Ford+Behaviors
•Redefining the role of a people leader and connectingit to the delivery of Ford+
•Building new skills and habits that drive behaviorchange, using Ford+ as the framework
•Leveraging supporting systems, tools, and processesto reinforce behavior changeContents
