Onboard Scales23
This available feature offers a scale that measures payload 
weight automatically based on the specific capability of the F-150 Lightning. It then displays the approximate payload weight in the truck. Load information is displayed in the center touchscreen with a graphic representation of the truck or on a mobile phone through the FordPass™ App. Additionally, the truck can be set on scale mode, which zeroes out the current load and allows for approximate weighing of additional items loaded onto the pickup
