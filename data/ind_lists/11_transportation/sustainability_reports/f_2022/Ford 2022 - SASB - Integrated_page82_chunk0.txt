Achieving Carbon Neutrality 
Our climate is changing faster than the world 
can ke
ep up. Rising sea levels, droughts and 
forest fires indicate the urgency of the situation. A comprehensive effort is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
In fact, Ford is working to minimize its impact on climate 
change aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Paris Agreement). We are committed to doing our part – it’s a strategic priority, one of our salient human rights issues, and integral to our purpose of helping make a better world. And it’s driving our transition to electrification and our goal of achieving carbon neutrality no later than 2050. 
Our Long-Term Aspirations and Near-Term Commitments 
To achieve our carbon neutrality goal, we are focusing on th
ree areas that account for approximately 95% of 
our CO2 emissions – our vehicles, our operations, and 
our supply chain. The steps we’re taking are: 
•Electrifying our iconic vehicles beginning with theMustang Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit.By 2026, we expect annual production of more than2 million EVs. By 2030, we expect EVs to represent halfof global volume. In Europe, we expect 100% of our carsto be fully electric by 2030. Two-thirds of commercialvehicle sales in Europe will be all-electric or plug-inhybrid by 2030 and all commercial vehicles in Europewill be zero emission by 2035.•Investing in EV technology and charging infrastructureto remove obstacles to electrification. We’re investing$50 billion  in electric vehicles and battery production
from 2022 through 2026
