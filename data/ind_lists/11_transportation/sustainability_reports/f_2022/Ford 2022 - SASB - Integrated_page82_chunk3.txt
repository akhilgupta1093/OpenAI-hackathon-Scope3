Achieving our long-term carbon neutrality goal is amb
itious and complex. To ensure near-term progress, we 
have developed science-based interim targets and joined global coalitions working towards our common goal. 
For example, Ford joined RouteZero, a global coalition 
wor
king towards all sales of new cars and vans being 
zero-emissions globally by 2040, and no later than 2035 in leading markets. 
This builds on our previous commitments to President 
Bid
en’s agenda to reduce GHG emissions in the United 
States by 50-52% by 2030, have 50% of our global sales volume being EVs by 2030, the UN’s Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5°C, and to the New Deal for Europe initiative to devise a comprehensive Sustainable Europe 2030 Strategy. We’ve also joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge to reduce GHG emissions from our facilities by at least half in the same timeframe. 
The above pledges are backed by interim targets 
app
roved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). 
Our emissions targets call for a 76% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2035 from a 2017 base year, and a 50% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emission per vehicle kilometer from use of sold products by 2035 from a 2019 base year. Electricity

This goes beyond tailpipe emissions, and includes reducing vehicle emissions from a fuel-cycle perspective (well-to-wheels) which include the production and consumption of fuel during vehicle use. Our Scope 1 and 2 operations target is aligned with the SBTi 1.5°C path, while our use of sold products (vehicle) target is consistent with the well-below 2°C target. These targets do not include offsets and are strictly GHG reduction targets. 
Addressing climate change is a global issue that no 
com
pany, industry, country, or organization can achieve 
on its own. It will require collaboration to drive progress. 76%
