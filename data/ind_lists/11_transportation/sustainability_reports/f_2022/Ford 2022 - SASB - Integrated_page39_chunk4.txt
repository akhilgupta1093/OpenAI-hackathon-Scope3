2021 marked the fifth year of our partnership with Primary Engineer – an educational nonprofit organization that encourages children and youth ages 3 to 19 to consider STEM and engineering careers. Employees from Ford’s Dunton engineering campus volunteer their time at local schools training teachers on how to introduce engineering concepts, while helping lead a classroom-based e
ngineering project that teaches students how to 
build electric vehicles. To date, the program has reached 65 schools and assisted 140 teachers and more than 3,483 students across the United Kingdom with the help of 45 Ford volunteers.
