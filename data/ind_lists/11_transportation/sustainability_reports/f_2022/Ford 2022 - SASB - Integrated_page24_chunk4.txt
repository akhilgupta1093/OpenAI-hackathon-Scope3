Building a Better World Achieving Carbon NeutralityFord has committed to achieve carbon neutrality worldwide a
cross our vehicles, facilities and suppliers no later than 
2050, and we have set out a strategic path to accelerate our progress, backed by science-based targets. This includes cutting GHG emissions across the use of our vehicles, driving energy efficiency and conservation in our facilities and manufacturing processes, and partnering with our suppliers to reduce their environmental impacts. Ford is the only full-line U.S. automaker to align with the Paris Agreement and to stand with the California Air Resources Board in support of stronger vehicle GHG emissions standards. And we are proud to stand with governments around the world working to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
