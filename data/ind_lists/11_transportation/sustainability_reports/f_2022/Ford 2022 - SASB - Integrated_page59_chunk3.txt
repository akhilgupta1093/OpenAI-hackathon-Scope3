DEI in Dealerships 
Ford is committed to transforming our independent For
d and Lincoln dealer network to better represent the 
communities we serve, and we are working with dealers to understand the customer and dealership employee experience. In the U.S. we are helping to increase the number of female and minority owned dealerships. In 2021 we increased Black-owned dealerships by 15% and plan to continue this progress. 
In 2021, we worked with a third party on a survey to help 
our d
ealers globally better understand their environment 
and their communities. We sought to understand current DEI efforts in Ford dealerships, and analyzed the potential impact of DEI efforts on the employee and customer experience
