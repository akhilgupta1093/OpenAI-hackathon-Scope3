We’ve been building the future for 11 8 year s now. But you 
don’t have to go back 11 8 year s to witness how we have 
transformed the ways people move and connect. 
Last year, we were proud to launch our inaugural Integrated 
Sustainability and Financial Report, building on more than two decades of sustainability reporting at Ford and giving our stakeholders a more holistic view of our performance. This year we have continued to evolve our process to better show the indelible link between our commitment to sustainability and our continued success, for generations to come. In Ford’s second Integrated Report, you’ll see what we’ve accomplished in the last year alone. We’ll show how we’ve revolutionized and electrified some of the most popular, iconic vehicles, helping to shape the future of zero-emissions transportation. You’ll see unprecedented investments in sustainable manufacturing and jobs to help drive the next century of progress. You’ll see the continued impact of Ford and the Ford Fund to strengthen communities around the world. And you’ll see how we’re investing in the talent, capabilities, and technologies that will help build sustainable and ethical growth for Ford and for our shared future. 
All of this is because the future of this company centers on a 
pu
rpose bigger than building vehicles. We are helping to build 
a better world, where every person is free to move and pursue their dreams. A world that is fully electric. A world that is more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable. And in doing so, we are putting people, the planet, and our shared prosperity first
