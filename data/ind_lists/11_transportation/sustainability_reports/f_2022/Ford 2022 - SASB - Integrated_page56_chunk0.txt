Freedom to Move 
As the pandemic transformed the way we 
work, we found new ways to get things done. Working remotely all across the country, Ford Buyer on the Electrified Powertrain Team Leilani King discovered the value of work/life balance, saying, “Whether it was early morning, or I was signing on from a tent on the Oregon Coast, the opportunities remote work presented made me far more motivated about my job.” Leilani traveled as far as California, Oregon and Hawaii while still being there for her team. “I’m living our Ford’s Purpose in a way that was never previously possible,” she says.Through experiential learning and 
engagement we’ve been able to foster open dialogue across the company and build empathy with events like the T ruth & Reconciliation Day in Canada, Juneteenth in the U.S., Global DEI Week, and the globalDay of Understanding. None of theseevents would have been successfulwithout passionate employeevolunteers teaching and organizing.”
