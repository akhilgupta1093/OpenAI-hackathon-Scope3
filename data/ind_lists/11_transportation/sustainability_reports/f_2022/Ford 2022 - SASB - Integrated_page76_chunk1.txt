Reimagining Business as Usual
The COVID-19 pandemic forced Ford and our dealers to reimagine “business as usual.” The new normal includes more remote and touchless experiences, as people shop for and reserve cars online. The pandemic has accelerated digital, remote, and touchless experiences as customers are engaging in new ways. This spurred us to accelerate digital, remote, and touchless experiences and also to make strategic choices, prioritizing work that leads to transformational change. 
As the pandemic continues, we’ve employed return-to-
work playbooks, staff training sessions, cleaning protocols, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other health and safety protocols to keep our employees and customers safe
