Ford: Always-on 
As the pandemic raged on, disrupting business as usual, our ap
proach to our customers has been changing and 
accelerating to meet evolving expectations – moving from a one-time sales and buying interaction to embracing the entire customer experience throughout the vehicle ownership cycle. Always-on. This change impacts everything we are doing at Ford, from how we design the in-vehicle experience to establishing a connected, transparent infrastructure to how we build commercial vehicles. 
For many Ford owners, their vehicle is a reflection and 
exte
nsion of their lifestyle – and we want to help them 
make the most of it
