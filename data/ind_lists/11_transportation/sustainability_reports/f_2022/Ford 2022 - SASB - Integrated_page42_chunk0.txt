Full-year benefits from strong mix and  
net pricing, as well as lower warranty  costs, more than offset the effects of the production losses and higher commodity costs. As a result, automotive EBIT of $7.4 billion and margin of 5.9% for 2021  were both significantly higher than in 2020.”

A Year of Important Progress on Our Ford+ Plan
Our 2021 results show that our Ford+ Plan is working. We’
re seeing real traction and making tremendous 
progress in both our financial performance and the strategic direction of the business. Revenue, net income, and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were all up, even though we sold nearly 250,000 fewer vehicles than we did in 2020 because of industry-wide semiconductor shortages and supply chain disruptions
