Another insight gained is we were not leveraging our 
ERG
s enough. Now multiple ERGs including Women 
of Ford, Ford Empowering Diverse Abilities (FEDA), Ford Pride, Ford Employees African Ancestry Network (FAAN), and Ford Hispanic Network (FHN), are providing input into improving the employee experience, product pro
grams, and marketing. For example, ERGs provided 
input to help the campus transformation team better understand the needs of our employees. Their partnership led to spaces with more inclusive designs, greater accessibility, the addition of wellness rooms, quiet zones, and gender-neutral bathrooms. 
DEI Data and Insights
Data visibility is essential to building trust internally and e
xternally. Not only have we launched a new DEI 
dashboard for senior leadership, but we also provide regular DEI updates in our Global Town Hall Meetings and through our internal websites
