We are applying freshwater reduction methods as 
well as improving our water quality discharges at our sites that mimic the behavior and performance of the local ecosystem. 
We have made progress toward our aspiration of using 
freshwater only for human consumption in our facilities that are in water-scarce regions, such as Mexico, China, and South Africa. In 2021, our use of alternative water exceeded 7% in these regions. Additionally Chennai Engine and Assembly have joined our Chihuahua Engine facility in achieving this goal by using zero freshwater for its manufacturing processes
