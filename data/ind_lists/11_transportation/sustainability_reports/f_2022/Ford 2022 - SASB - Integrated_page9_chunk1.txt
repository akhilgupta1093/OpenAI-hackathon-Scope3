Y D U T  S E S A CA Ford Dealer Family for 
Two Generations Steps Up to Do What’s Right
Juan Martin Simone  is a second-
generation Ford dealer in Argentina, 
and the Ford dealership, the first in 
South America, is not the only thing Juan inherited from his father. He inherited a sense of responsibility in building public trust – an obligation to his community to help and do what’s right. Today, Juan and his family continue to embody this spirit 
at the dealership. So, when he heard about a local non-profit group stepping in to help those in need, he got involved, helping the group build a school from scratch for a low-income province by providing food, financial resources and, of course, Ford trucks.
