Corporate Governance Principles – Together with the

rters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation, 
Talent and Culture Committee, the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee, the Finance Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee, our Corporate Governance Principles provide the framework for the governance of Ford Motor Company. Our Board of Directors reviews these principles and other aspects of our governance annually or, more often, as deemed necessary or appropriate. The Board is elected by and responsible to Ford’s shareholders. Ford’s business is conducted by its employees, managers, and officers, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and oversight of the Board, to enhance the long-term value of the company for its shareholders. The Board of Directors monitors the performance of the CEO and senior management to assure that the long-term interests of the shareholders are being served
