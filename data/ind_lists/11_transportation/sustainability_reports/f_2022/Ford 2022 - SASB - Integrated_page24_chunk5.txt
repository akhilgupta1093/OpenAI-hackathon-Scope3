nd breaking constraints to lead the electric revolution, 
investing $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 in electric vehicles and the batteries that power them. Electrificatioamplifies the attributes our customers love, such as performance, capability, and convenience. Within our new line-up, disruptive technology allows us to enrich thecustomer experience and improve performance, safety, and accessibility. We’re focusing on what we build and how we build them to make EVs that are sustainable, accessible, and affordable for more people. We’re reducing the effects of our operations and supply chains through world-class facilities, including our commitment to sourcing 100 percent carbon-free electricity for our global operations by 2035. And by using recycled and renewable materials in our vehicles, we’re reducing landfill waste and using fewer natural resources. A major component of EVs is the batteries that power them. We work with our suppliers and business partners for responsible raw material sourcing and enhance b
attery recycling, and to build out battery recycling and 
a domestic battery supply chain for our electric vehicles.
