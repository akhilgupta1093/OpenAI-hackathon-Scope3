Winning businesses are financially 
healthy and lead in sustainability – it’s not a choice, they rely on each other. We’re again putting our money where our mouth is, prioritizing and allocating capital to environmental and social initiatives that are good for people, good for the planet, and good for Ford.”
John Lawler,  
Chief Financial Officer
