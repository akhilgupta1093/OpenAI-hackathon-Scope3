The Promoting the Empowerment of Women in Copper and Cobalt Mineral Supply Chains program aims to increase access to profitable, sustainable enterprises by training women on financial education, business management, mining innovation and leadership, and formalizing women’s Artisanal and Small Mine cooperatives that allow equal access to market opportunities. The program will track the impact of and inform future public policy and private programs through an analytical study on women in cobalt and Artisanal and Small Mines supply chains. The program addresses poverty, one of the root cause of child labor, and demonstrates how Ford is already taking action in response to the 2021 Action Pledge for the UN’s International Year for the Elimination of Child Labor
