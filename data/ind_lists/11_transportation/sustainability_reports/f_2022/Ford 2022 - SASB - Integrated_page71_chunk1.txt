Post-Crash R esponse 
Our SYNC in-car connectivity helps occupants to call for 
assistance after an accident, and can give first responders 
potentially life-saving information, quickly and efficiently. 
In addition to providing the operator with a GPS location, 
SYNC in-car connectivity relays data on impact velocity, 
crash type, safety belt use, and airbag deployment, 
helping emergency services respond appropriately. 
Most of our vehicles also carry the SOS Post-Crash Alert 
Syste m™, which alerts passers-by and first responders 
to a vehicle’s location. 
In parallel to a mandatory EU regulation on Automated 
Emergency Calling Systems for new vehicles in 2018, 
a UN regulation to harmonize all in-vehicle systems on 
a global scale has also been adopted
