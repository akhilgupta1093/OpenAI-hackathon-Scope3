We have developed our social sustainability aspirations to 
alig
n with our purpose to build a better world. To achieve 
these aspirations, Ford’s Human Rights strategy, aligned 
with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP) on Business and Human Rights, focuses on: •embedding the corporate policy into the business
•due diligence processes to identify, prevent, mitigateand account for human rights impacts
•providing remedial actions when needed
•transparency with our stakeholders about ourprocesses and actions
Governance of human rights issues begins with our CEO an
d Board of Directors and cascades through the 
organization, providing a framework to assess risk through the identification of salient human rights issues, conduct due diligence, and report transparently about our actions and processes. Ford conducts human rights risk assessments across its global facilities, in addition to the saliency assessment. 
In 2021, our Salient Human Rights Governance team, 
with o
versight from our Director of Global Sustainability, 
continued to manage and track our action plans to prevent, manage, and remediate salient human rights issues. This process helps us track the effectiveness of our due diligence systems and performance and indicates opportunities to further improve our efforts to address human rights, including those that affect how we source materials responsibly. 
Because of our deep commitment to these issues, this 
year F
ord has developed a stand-alone Human Rights 
Report, the first in the industry, to address our salient human rights issues, how they are managed, and the key actions that demonstrate our progress. It provides a more detailed look at our human rights activities and accomplishments, as well as the governance structure and practices in place to ensure implementation of our human rights strategy.Identifying Our Salient Human Rights IssuesWe conducted our third saliency assessment in line with 
the UN G
uiding Principles Reporting Framework 
(UNGPRF) to identify and prioritize salient human rights issues that apply throughout our business and supply chain. The saliency assessment helped us identify which human rights are considered at risk of the most severe negative impact through the company’s activities and business relationships, and any emerging issues that ought to be monitored closely.
