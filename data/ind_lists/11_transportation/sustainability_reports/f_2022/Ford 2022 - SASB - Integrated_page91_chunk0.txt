Air:  Attain zero emissions from our  
vehicles and facilities 
We believe that everyone is entitled to 
breathe clean air. Reducing air pollution is vital to protecting people and the environment — and our efforts to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

Through our research and vehicle development, we are 
working to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter that pollute the air, in accordance with increasingly stringent standards around the world. 
Standards Continue to Tighten 
Internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) emit hydr
ocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and 
particulate matter. These pollutants can affect air quality, particularly in urban areas, and potentially impact human health. 
Ford is proud to comply with all global criteria emission 
stan
dards as they are introduced. The enforcement of 
such standards has led to lower vehicle emissions and, along with actions in sectors beyond transportation (residential, commercial, and industrial), have led to major improvements in air quality in many cities in recent decades. In communities where air pollution and climate change are disproportionate burdens today, access to electric vehicles can help provide health, economic, and Several countries and states are announcing plans to ban IC

Our Progress in China All Ford manufacturing facilities in China have taken vari
ous measures to significantly reduce emissions. 
From 2020 to 2021, plants reduced VOC emissions by 19% (3.7g/m
2), equivalent to an annual reduction of 
more than 250 metric tons of VOC emissions through various management and engineering investment measures, contributing to cleaner air. Regional Emissions Standards
