Some examples of our global wellbeing initiatives include building our global pool of trained and certified Mental Health First Aiders to provide peer to peer mental health support, Mindfulness clubs, and World Mental Health Day observances, among other things. 
We also launched a new employee experience with a global wellbeing site, self-guided tools, and access to the professional support and resources to help employees achieve their own sense of wellbeing.
