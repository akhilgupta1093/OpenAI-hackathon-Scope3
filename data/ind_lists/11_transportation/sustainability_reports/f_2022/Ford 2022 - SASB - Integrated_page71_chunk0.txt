Combating Heatstroke in Vehicles 
On average, a child dies from vehicular heatstroke everynine days in t 
he United States 
. In response, we have 
developed a Rear Occupant Alert System that gives an “in-vehicle” warning via our SYNC® system. Introduced in the 2020 model year Escape and Corsair, the system is included in all four-door 2021 model year vehicles equippedwith SYNC, meeting the 2019 Voluntary Agreement. The feature will be deployed globally where feasible. 
 
Ford will continue to enhance warning notifications for future models and research technologies that can detect in-cabin occupant presence. These features will help address scenarios beyond those defined by the 2019 Voluntary Agreement, and should enhance effectiveness in minimizing and potentially avoiding pediatric vehicular heatstroke cases
