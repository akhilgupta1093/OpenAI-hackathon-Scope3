Supplier Code of Conduct
As we increasingly turn our attention not just to the emi
ssions of the vehicles we build but also to the 
environmental and human rights impacts of making them, we have taken a big step by strengthening the code of conduct that we expect our suppliers to follow. With hundreds of companies involved in building Ford vehicles, supplying everything from fasteners to software, our new Supplier Code of Conduct applies not only to the com
pany’s Tier 1 suppliers, but to their suppliers as well. 
It is available in eight languages, accessible to everyone. 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct mandates that our 
supp
liers maintain responsible business practices: 
•Conducting business free from bribery and corruption
•Maintaining effective privacy and cyber-security practices
•Complying with applicable trade and customs rules
