The Ford Accessibility Program, offering a variety of 
ad
aptable vehicles to meet different needs and budgets, 
makes it easier for persons with disabilities to get on the road. To broaden these capabilities in a high-tech world, we launched a series of internal webinars and events to raise awareness and increase engagement across the company on issues of vehicle accessibility. These learning events have included direct engagement with a group of customers who have one or more disabilities, to advance discussions on inclusive design practices. Ford is also continuing this inquiry as a member of the Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (AVA) and as a sponsor of AVAâ€™s most recent research on accessible and barrier-free autonomous vehicles, while actively participating in and helping facilitate informative webinar sessions organized by the AVA, Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), and other partner organizations.
