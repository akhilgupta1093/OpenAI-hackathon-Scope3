As an IRMA member, Ford communicated ex
pectations to key suppliers to source mined 
material from suppliers committing to and/or participating in IRMA certification. We reached out to suppliers providing parts containing aluminum, steel, rare earth elements, palladium, cobalt, lithium & nickel. Suppliers were asked to identify sources of mined materials and complete a Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) Risk Readiness Assessment (RRA) to better understand our supply chainâ€™s current ESG practices and gaps as well as commit to engaging with IRMA in 2022
