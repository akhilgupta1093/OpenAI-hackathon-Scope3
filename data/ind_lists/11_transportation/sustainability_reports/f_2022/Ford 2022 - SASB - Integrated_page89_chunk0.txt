On the commercial side, our goal is to provide our 
customers with greater value and higher productivity through the industry’s most comprehensive and flexible range of electric and internal combustion commercial vehicles. With Ford Pro, we’re incorporating digital and physical services that can help optimize and maintain customer fleets and offering public, depot, and employee home charging of EVs for the next day’s work. 
We will continue to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 
emissions across our global vehicle portfolio to minimize the environmental impact associated with their use, while rapidly increasing the sales rate of our electrified vehicles. 
Climate Change Reporting 
We are committed to transparently reporting our climate ch
ange strategies and their resilience. We have received 
the 2020 CDP ratings and received A ratings for both Water and Climate (our 3rd year in a row as “A” for climate and 7th for water) and have issued climate change scenario reports since 2019. This year we have produced a consolidated report that combines our Climate Change Scenario Report and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index. The report outlines our strategies, World Energy Outlook 2021 Scenarios, the resiliency of our strategies to those scenarios, and how we will monitor and review the impacts of climate change on our strategies.
