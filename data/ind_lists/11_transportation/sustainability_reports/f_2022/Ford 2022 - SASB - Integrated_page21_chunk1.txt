Lisa:  I’m proud of how our team has worked to be creative 
a
nd to keep delivering value to our customers. This is such 
a critical time for Ford, when we are continuing to invest in 
our business and making the move toward electrification. This is where our partnerships play a critical role in helping make our business more resilient over the long term. Our work with Redwood Materials, for example, is looking at ways to integrate recycled materials into Ford’s domestic battery strategy. This is going to be critical to our sustainable leadership into the future
