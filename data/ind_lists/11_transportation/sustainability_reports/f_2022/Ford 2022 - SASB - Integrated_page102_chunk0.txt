Government Regulations, 
Policy and Engagement
Governments around the world make decisions on a variety of important policy issues 
that have an impact on Ford’s businesses. As a global company, it is critical that Ford has a voice to help inform the policies affecting our employees, customers, and shareholders. We believe strong engagement with government plays a key role in shaping the regulations and legislation that govern our business. 
That’s why the company participates openly and 
transparently in the political process to support local, state, national, and international policies that are economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable for our company, our customers, and their communities. This activity includes working with the United States Congress and the White House, as well as governments globally, on issues such as a consistent policy toward electrification in all markets, an EV charging infrastructure, the semiconductor chip shortage, battery recycling polices, an effective carbon tax, and opening up the supply of minerals to achieve our business, environmental, and employment objectives
