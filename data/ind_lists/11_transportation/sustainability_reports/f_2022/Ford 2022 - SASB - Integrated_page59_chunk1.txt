A Look Ahead Our DEI journey is ongoing. Making sustainable progress is ou
r core focus and we will continue to hold ourselves 
accountable. In 2021, each corporate officer had a DEI objective and in 2022 this was expanded to all salaried employees globally. We will continue building our data gathering and metrics capability in order to leverage actionable insights. This includes a voluntary self identification initiative to gather multiple demographics intended to provide more accurate and robust data including multiple gender options and LGBTQ+ status
