Training and Developing Our Talent 
Our future success depends on our people. We believe that o
ngoing training, learning, and development are 
critical elements to providing employees with insight into organizational skill needs, developing learning solutions to address those needs, and enabling them to improve performance through skills application is critical to our transformation. We continue to make learning and development opportunities a central part of our brand to help attract and retain top talent. 
In 2021, we focused on energizing our 15,000+ people 
lead
ers to be catalysts, leading their teams to deliver 
Ford+, and building the foundation for long-term success.
