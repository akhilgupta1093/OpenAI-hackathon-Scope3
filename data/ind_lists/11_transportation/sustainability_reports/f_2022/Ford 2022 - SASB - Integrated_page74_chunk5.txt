Pickup and Delivery
Strengthening our commitment to provide an elevated lev
el of customer support, we began pickup and delivery 
services in the early days of the pandemic, when some Ford dealerships realized that customers would appreciate getting their vehicles serviced while staying safe in the comfort of their home. The process is simple – customers call their local dealer to schedule an app
ointment and request an at-home or at-work pickup. 
On the day of service, customers receive updates via phone, text or e-mail to keep them informed of their vehicle’s progress, and it’s delivered back as soon as the service is complete
