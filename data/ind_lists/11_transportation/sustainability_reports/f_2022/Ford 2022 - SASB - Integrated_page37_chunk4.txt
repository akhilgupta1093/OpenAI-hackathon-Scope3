Our LCA-based studies evaluate potential environmental 
im
plications of vehicle raw materials and manufacturing; 
for example, recycled polymers, cradle-to-gate impacts of lithium-ion batteries, and additive manufacturing. We are collaborating with Redwood Materials to integrate battery recycling into our domestic battery strategy. Redwoodâ€™s recycling technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of strategic materials such as nickel, cobalt, lithium and copper
