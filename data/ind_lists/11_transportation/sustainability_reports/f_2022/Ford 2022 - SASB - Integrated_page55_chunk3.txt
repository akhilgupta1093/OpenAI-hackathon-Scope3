Weâ€™re expanding our approach, our reach and shifting our 
sk
ill and degree requirements to attract great talent in a 
competitive environment. We are also evolving how and where we source our talent as many employees are no longer bound to physical locations. 
AI is helping us eliminate bias in the recruitment process 
by p
utting students in front of us that we might never 
have considered before (and vice versa). This is a shift from where we were just two years ago where we recruited from a set list of schools. We now recruit from anywhere as part of our model and are able to go where the talent exists
