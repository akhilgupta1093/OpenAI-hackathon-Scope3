Financial Risks
Market Disruption:  Our business is susceptible to credit 
ra
ting downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, 
and regulatory requirements, which may impact our ability to obtain unsecured funding at a reasonable cost. Moreover, if these events occur, Ford Credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchases or originates because of funding constraints.Government Incentives:  We receive economic benefits 
f
rom national, state, and local governments around 
the world in the form of grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. These incentives encourage manufacturers to establish or increase investment, workforce, and/or production. A decrease, expiration, or clawback of such incentives could impact our financial condition significantly
