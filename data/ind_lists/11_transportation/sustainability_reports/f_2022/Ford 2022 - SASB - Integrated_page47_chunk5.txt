In Europe, the IONITY high-power charging network 
wil
l grow 7,000 charging points by 2025, to create 
a supporting infrastructure as we accelerate the electrification of our vehicles.Developing Alternative Powertrains 
and Fuel Options 
As we launch electrified versions of our most popular 
nameplates, we will continue researching and developing alternative powertrains and fuel options across all our vehicles, to provide customers with efficient, low-carbon alternatives. This effort includes the development of hydrogen fuel cell technology, with a primary focus on medium/heavy-duty vehicles to offer payload and uptime advantages that provide total cost-of-ownership benefits. Ford is partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy to develop and demonstrate five hydrogen fuel cell electric Class-5 Super Duty trucks through the DOE SuperTruck 3 program. The projectâ€™s goals are cost, payload, towing, and refueling times that are equivalent to conventional gasoline trucks
