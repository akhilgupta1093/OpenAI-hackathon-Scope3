concentrated entirely on customer needs and desires. Ford engineers and d
esigners were able to create 
the Mustang Mach-E with SUV-size proportions to seat five adults comfortably – plenty of space for friends, kids, and cargo. 
The Mustang Mach-E instills 
con
fidence with an EPA-estimated 
range of 314 miles for the CA Route 1 Extended Range Model* with extended-range battery and RWD, offering built-in charging solutions that route customers to nearby public charging stations and provide recommendations on where to charge on trips. Mustang Mach-E owners, in fact, have access to over 20,500 public charge stations in the BlueOval™ Charge Network
