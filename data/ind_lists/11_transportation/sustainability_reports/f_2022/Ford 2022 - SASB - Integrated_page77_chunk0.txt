 FordPass App Helps
Rescue Stolen TransitFull of Dogs
Ford is now equipping all new vehicles with 
built-in modems as standard to add vast connected vehicle functionality, including the ability to pinpoint locations remotely. This feature came in handy in the U.K. when a man’s Transit Custom, with a bunch of dogs in the back, was stolen. The dogs were dropped off and found later in a park. The thieves’ next move in the Transit showed up on FordPass, which traced the van to another part of the park where police seized the vehicle. 
Time is money for our hard-working business customers; so we’re focused on keeping them on the road through programs like Ford Pro and our Ranger Support Teams in Australia, Thailand, and South Africa.

sure that we are representing the diversity of our 
customer base and their perspectives in an authentic way. To that end, our focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion extends beyond who we show in our advertising to how we source the creative development and production of our content across all mediums
