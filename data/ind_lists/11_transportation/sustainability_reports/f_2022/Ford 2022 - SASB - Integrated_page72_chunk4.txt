â€¢ We are increasing our use of advanced data analytics and machine learning to help with the earlier detection of potential issues across our vehicle portfolio, even before delivering the vehicle to the customer. Our Early Quality Issue Suite draws on multiple data sources, from connected vehicles to customer service calls, to accelerate the investigative process. This tool minimizes time from detection to correction by combining this information with automatic anomaly detection and root cause analysis
