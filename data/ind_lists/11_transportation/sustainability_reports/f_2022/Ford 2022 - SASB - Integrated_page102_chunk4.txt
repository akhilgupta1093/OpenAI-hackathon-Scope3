Trade Associations and Memberships Focusing  
on U
.S. Policy Issues 
To use our resources effectively on key issues, we work wi
th a broad range of coalitions, industry groups, and 
trade associations where we operate. This helps us exchange ideas and collaborate to develop and promote sensible policies that benefit our company, our industry, and society. These organizations often bring diverse viewpoints to the debate, and sometimes their views are not shared by Ford. At times we have exercised our right to make our own position clear and have taken an alternative path when it has been necessary. 
Climate Change
We believe there is strength and value in using me
mberships in our trade associations and coalitions to 
move these organizations toward positions more aligned with Fordâ€™s views on climate. This helps us develop and promote policies that benefit our customers, company, industry, and society
