In motorsports, the M-Sport Ford World Rally Team 
is c
ombining both alternative fuels and electrification. 
All FIA WRC Rally competitors will use a fossil-free fuel in the 2022 season, blending synthetic e-fuel and biofuel elements to produce a fuel that is 100% sustainable. The new M-Sport Ford Puma Hybrid Rally is Fordâ€™s first electrified competition car. 
Reducing Emissions in Our Operations 
Improved energy efficiency and conservation in our facilities and manufacturing processes have resulted in a 35% reduction in our GHG footprint since 2017. Using energy more efficiently, procuring power from carbon-free sources, reducing GHG emissions from our operations, and making our transportation and Vehicles Powered by Alternative Fuels 
Renewable Biofuel Vehicles CNG and LPG Vehicles Hydrogen Fuel Cell 
Ve
hicles (FCVs) 
Fuel Ethanol,  made from fermented corn sugars or sugar 
ca
ne, is usually blended with gasoline (e.g., E10, E15, 
E22 or E85); ethanol from non-food feedstocks is technically feasible 
Renewable diesel and biodiesel  can be made from 
so
y, canola, rapeseed, corn or palm oil, or animal fats, 
and mixed with fossil diesel Biodiesel  via transesterification (FAME) typically has 
lo
wer blends (B5,B7, B20) 
Paraffinic renewable diesel  produced via hydrotreating 
(H
VO) or the Fischer-Tropsch process can be blended 
at higher concentrations (R33 up to R100) Compressed natural

Benefits Biofuels  made from renewable resources may reduce 
CO2 emissions 
Next-generation biofuels  made from plant 
ce
llulose use stems and leaves, reducing competition 
for food crops Lower well-to-wheels CO2 
emissions than gasoline or diesel vehicles 
Lower non-CO

only water and low-temperature heat as by-products  
Upstream hydrogen production emissions become zero with a renewable electric grid
