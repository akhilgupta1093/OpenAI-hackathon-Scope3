Winegrowers T eamUp to ElectrifyFarming Business
The Sonoma County Wine Growers, with more 
than 1,800 members in Northern California, is planning to advance its sustainability efforts, with the help of the Ford Pro suite of electric vehicles, charging and telematics services. Ford Pro and the growers are launching a pilot program that will add F-150 Lightning Pro pickups, E-Transit cargo vans, and Ford Pro Intelligence products and services to three pilot farms. 
The farms are being outfitted with Ford Pro 
charging stations to complement the solar power that has been a critical part of the group’s push for sustainability since 2014. Ford Pro Intelligence services are expected to help optimize their gas and electric fleets by providing always-on access to vehicle health reports and other data that help reduce operating costs, vehicle downtime, and fuel consumption
