To build these campuses, we are making the largest 
singl
e U.S. investment in electric vehicles at one 
time by any automotive manufacturer. Along with our partner, SK Innovation, we plan to invest $11.4 billion  and create nearly 11,000 new jobs at 
the Tennessee and Kentucky mega-sites. 
The all-new mega campus in Stanton, Tennessee, 
cal
led BlueOval City, will be among the largest auto 
manufacturing sites in U.S. history, encompassing vehicle assembly, battery production, recycling, training and technical education programs, and a supplier park. The vertically integrated system will deliver cost efficiency while minimizing the carbon footprint of the manufacturing process, including the potential to use local renewable energy sources such as wind, solar power, nuclear, geothermal, biomass, energy storage, and hydro. The assembly plant will be designed to be carbon neutral with zero waste to landfill once fully operational.Beyond its payload and towing cap
abilities, the F-150 hybrid and 
electric models both feature optional Pro-Power Onboard, a power back-up system that transforms the vehicle into a generator that can supply enough juice to run tools at your workplace or appliances on the go. The F-150 Lightning also has Intelligent BackUp Power, the ability to power your home in an outage for 3-10 days
