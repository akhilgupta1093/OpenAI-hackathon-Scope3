Environmental Governance 
GM reduces operational risks through sound environmental 
management and by prioritizing compliance. We measure and manage 
natural resources used at all manufacturing locations, engineering 
centers, parts distribution centers and proving ground sites around  
the world. 
These facilities vary in function, geography, size and surrounding 
natural environments, which gives rise to varying concerns such as 
resource scarcity, different regulatory requirements and varying levels 
of environmental quality. These GM-owned and -operated facilities 
have location-specific operating plans that all function under GM’s 
global Environmental Policy.c)  Describe how
