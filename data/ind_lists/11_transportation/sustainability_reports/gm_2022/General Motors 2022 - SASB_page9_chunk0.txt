GRI 303: WATER AND EFFLUENTS (CONT.)
303-2 Management of water discharge-related impacts General Motors maintains an environmental performance criteria document on water pollution control (EPC-003). Within this 
document, minimum concentration-based performance requirements are defined for wastewater discharge to surface water and 
for wastewater discharges to external wastewater systems. Where local permit limits are more stringent, those supersede the GM 
requirements. Where no permit limit is provided, the performance requirements are used. 
303-3 Water withdrawal GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilitiesâ€™ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly 
basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small 
facilities (offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this 
represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source
