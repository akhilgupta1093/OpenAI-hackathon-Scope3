Risk: Lack of EV charging infrastructure potentially impacting 
consumer adoption
Consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. 
This could be impacted by numerous factors, including the proliferation 
of charging infrastructure (in particular public charging stations). 
Also, the failure by governments and other third parties to make the 
investments necessary for infrastructure improvements, such as 
greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, or 
to provide economic incentives promoting EVs, could impact consumer 
adoption as well
