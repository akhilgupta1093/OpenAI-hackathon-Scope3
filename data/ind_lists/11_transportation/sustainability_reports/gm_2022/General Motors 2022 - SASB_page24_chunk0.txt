TCFD ResponseApproach
We manage these risks based on the location of our operations around 
the world and the risk profile for a particular region. As an example, 
increases in the frequency of drought conditions can depress water 
availability for production in water-stressed areas. GM has production 
facilities in Mexico, an area hard hit by drought in recent years, and 
there is a risk that increases in the frequency of such events could 
disrupt production due to lack of water availability. 
GM has integrated water management into our annual business 
planning process and has set a target to reduce the water intensity  
of our operations 35% by 2035 compared to a 2010 baseline. We  
also have signed the CEO Water Mandate—a UN Global Compact 
Initiative—joining other global business leaders to address key 
challenges around water security and further aligning the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. We also are a long-term reporter  
to CDP Water and have made the “A” list for three consecutive years
