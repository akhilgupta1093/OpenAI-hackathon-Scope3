Opportunity: Shift in consumer preferences toward EVs 
creating new sales and new customer opportunities
Approach
In 2021, we accelerated our plan to transition to an all-electric  
future by announcing an in crease in our EV and AV development 
investment target from $20 billion to $35 billion within the period  
of 2020 through 2025. 
We also announced plans to introduce more than 30 EVs globally 
by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds of these available in 
North America. These introductions, along with additional EVs being 
planned, will enable EV sales to represent 40% to 50% of annual U.S. 
automotive sales volume by 2030, which is aligned with the current 
administrationâ€™s target of 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030. To 
reach this upper range, we will continue to work with federal, state  
and local governments to implement supportive policies that will move 
the United States closer to meeting the carbon neutrality goals of the  
Paris Agreement
