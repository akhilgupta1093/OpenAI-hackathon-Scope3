To identify and mitigate human rights risk in the sourcing of these raw materials, our 
due diligence practices undertaken in connection with our Responsible Materials 
Program and our Conflict Mineral Program are aligned with the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. 
We enjoy strong management support for conflict mineral supply chain due diligence. 
A compliance committee comprised of cross-functional GM leaders and an executive 
steering committee provide leadership and direction for the program
