During 2021, our ESG management teams also continued to expand 
throughout the organization, including individuals with climate 
expertise in areas such as global purchasing and supply chain (GPSC), 
engineering, legal and public policy, among others. We are strengthening 
our internal bench to increase our ability to identify and manage climate-
related risks and continually ensure operational teams are aligning our 
business strategy with our ESG strategy
