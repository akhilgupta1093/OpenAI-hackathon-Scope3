Approach
We are working closely with governments worldwide to implement 
complementary policies to bolster consumer education and incentives, 
infrastructure, manufacturing, clean power, and research and 
development investments that are critical to the success of our all-
electric vision and our broader climate goals. 
To accomplish these advocacy objectives, GM is committed to working 
globally with a broad set of key partners, industry associations, 
coalitions and governmental policymakers at the national, state/ 
provincial and local levels. 
A detailed discussion of our advocacy efforts can be found in our 
Public Policy Supplement
