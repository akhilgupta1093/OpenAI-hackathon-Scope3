Raw material cost and supply variability are monitored closely 
by purchasing teams and senior leaders from multiple parts of 
the business. GM is prioritizing the development of a resilient and 
sustainable supply chain of raw materials to manufacture our battery 
chemistry, which requires cobalt, battery-grade nickel and lithium as 
well as other minerals. We are proactively and aggressively pursuing 
responsibly sourced materials at strategic tiers of the supply chain and 
exploring where investment and partnerships can yield benefits and 
untapped value that lowers costs of advanced technologies. Recently, 
we have advanced several initiatives in North America related to 
supplies of silicon carbide device solutions, rare earth minerals, lithium 
and cathode active material.a)  Describe the
