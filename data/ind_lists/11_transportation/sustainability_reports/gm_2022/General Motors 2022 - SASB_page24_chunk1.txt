Water consumption is managed on a local basis, with each facility 
working toward its own targets for year-over-year improvement. 
Innovative approaches have allowed facilities to continue production 
without disruptions, even in water-stressed areas. At our San Luis 
Potosí assembly plant in Mexico, GM uses a zero liquid discharge 
system to minimize the reliance on well water. The system purifies  
and transforms wastewater into reusable water for the facility’s paint 
and machining processes, as well as for landscape irrigation
