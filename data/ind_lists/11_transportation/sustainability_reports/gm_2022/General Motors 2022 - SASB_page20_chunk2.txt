Expertise related to environmental, social and/or governance-related 
issues, including climate, are among the qualifications considered prior 
to recommending an incumbent, replacement or additional director to 
the Board. 
The Board discharges its risk oversight responsibilities, in part, through 
delegation to its committees. The Board has six standing committees: 
Audit; Executive; Executive Compensation; Finance; Governance and 
Corporate Responsibility; and Risk and Cybersecurity. All standing 
committees of the Board, other than the Executive Committee, are 
composed entirely of independent directors. As a full Board, and 
through these committees, the Board is committed to overseeing the 
company’s integration of ESG principles throughout GM’s business and 
managing the related risks and opportunities. 
Each committee has a written charter setting forth its purpose, 
authority and duties. Overall, the committees enhance the Board’s 
oversight of areas that are critical to GM’s corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts, including transparent and reliable financial 
reporting; risk identification and mitigation (including climate change 
and other ESG issues); ethics and compliance; product and workplace 
safety; supply chain and human rights; pay-for-performance; data 
security; diversity, equity and inclusion; Board and management 
succession planning; consideration of shareholder proposals; and 
political and lobbying priorities and expenditures
