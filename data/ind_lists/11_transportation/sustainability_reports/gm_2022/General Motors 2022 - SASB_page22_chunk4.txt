Manufacturing Leadership Team (MLT) 
The scale of our manufacturing operations also presents significant 
opportunities for emissions reduction. On a monthly basis, GMâ€™s progress toward science-based targets for 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3, as well as other key climate-related indicators, such  
as water and waste, are reviewed and tracked against internal targets 
by the MLT. Progress toward projects and initiatives to support our 
targets are also reviewed by the MLT. 
Local Management 
At the local manufacturing plant level, management is responsible 
for tracking energy consumption and continuously analyzing and 
reviewing opportunities for energy conservation, as well as monitoring 
potential climate-related impacts, including catastrophic risks or 
losses from natural events that may occur at their site. 
Similar analysis and evaluation at the operational level occur when 
selecting new sites as well as considering new suppliers
