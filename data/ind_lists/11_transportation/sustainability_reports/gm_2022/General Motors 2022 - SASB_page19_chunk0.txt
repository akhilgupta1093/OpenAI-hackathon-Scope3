(ELV) law requires OEMs to have programs to retrieve and recycle our vehicles. No other 
region of sale has this requirement. However, the automobile is considered the most 
reused and recycled product in the marketplace. In North America and other regions, 
there is a well-established automotive dismantling industry that manages this activity. 
Per the Automotive Recyclers Association, the professional automotive recycling industry 
recycles over 4 million motor vehicles annually in the United States and Canada alone. The 
U.S. automotive recycling industry employs over 140,000 people in the United States at 
more than 9,000 locations around the country, generating $32 billion in sales nationwide. 
Per The Balance Small Business Sustainable Businesses/Metal Recycling website,* each
