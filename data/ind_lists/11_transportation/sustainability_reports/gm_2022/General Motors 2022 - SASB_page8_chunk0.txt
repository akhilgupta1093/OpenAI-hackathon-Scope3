303-1 Interactions with water as a shared resource A combination of municipal, wells and surface water are sources for GM’s water withdrawal. Water is critical to automobile production 
and to building occupants for drinking water and hygiene. Local facility knowledge provides information on water supply impacts for 
current operations, and we engage in the use of WRI Aqueduct for future forecasting. Risks in current operations are mitigated with 
alternate supply, working with local utilities, conservation or process water reuse. GM engages with over 300 suppliers through CDP 
Water Supply Chain and other organizations like AIAG. Company goals were set to continuously improve and reduce intensity from  
2010 to 2035 by 35%. Water is integrated into our business plan, and each facility has a target for year-over-year reductions
