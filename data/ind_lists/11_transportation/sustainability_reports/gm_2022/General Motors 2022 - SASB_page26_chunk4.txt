GM is committed to developing a broad set of EVs for every lifestyle 
and price point. This will be enabled by our proprietary Ultium 
Platformâ€”a combined EV architecture and propulsion system that 
enables EVs at scale. This platform can power transportation from 
family vehicles to luxury vehicles, work trucks and high-performance 
vehicles. As a result, GM will be positioned to compete for nearly every 
customer type and preference in the market
