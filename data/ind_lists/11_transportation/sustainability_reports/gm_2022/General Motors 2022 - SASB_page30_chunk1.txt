During 2021, we took steps to develop and refine our processes for 
identifying and evaluating climate-related risks. In collaboration with a 
third-party consultant, our corporate sustainability team convened and 
hosted a series of workshops with leaders from across key functions of 
the business, including public policy, GHG emissions experts, portfolio 
planning, strategic risk management, supply chain, legal and others.  
Through these workshops, we developed and validated an initial 
risk identification process as well as helped to ensure a strong and 
consistent understanding of the process for analyzing climate-related 
risks for TCFD purposes. 
Over the course of multiple days and sessions, we discussed dozens  
of potential risks and opportunities to determine those most applicable 
to our business, and then to qualitatively prioritize them. This 
identification and prioritization exercise was performed by business 
experts and leaders based on the experience and expertise of each. 
The results were further validated by sharing and discussing with the 
broader Office of Sustainability  governance body, which includes 
senior leaders working on sustainability across the business
