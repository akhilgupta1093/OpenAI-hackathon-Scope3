Over the course of 2022, we will continue refining our risk 
identification process and assessing our exposure to these risks by 
partnering with a respected third party to employ their climate risk 
modeling platform. We will quantitatively evaluate both physical and 
transition risks under at least two to three different climate change 
scenarios. We will be paying careful attention to the sensitivity of 
the results to different assumptions and parameters. We also will be 
exploring how to further integrate the results from this assessment 
into strategic decision-making, as well as opportunities to internalize 
some of these processes and tools to enable us to efficiently conduct 
these assessments in the future.Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C2.2, C2.2a, 
C2.3a) for more details
