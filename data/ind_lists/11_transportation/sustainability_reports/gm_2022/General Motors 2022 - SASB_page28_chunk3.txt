Based on our planned cadence of EV introductions, GM will have more 
than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of  
2025. Additionally, GM will build up more than 1 million units in China 
over the same time frame. Our EV portfolio is planned to be among 
the broadest in the industry, with entries from affordable, high-volume 
market segments to top-of-the-line models and ev erything in between. Opportunity: Technological advances (e.g., battery and 
manufacturing efficiency) enabling resource and cost savings
Approach
Ultium represents a milestone achievement in electrification, with battery 
pack costs nearly 40% lower compared to the previous generation, and we 
expect the second generation Ultium packs will cost nearly 60% less than 
the batteries used today.1 We are committed to continuous improvement 
in manufacturing, materials and packaging efficiencies, high-energy cell 
design and increased vertical integration with local production that will 
deliver greater energy density at a lower cost
