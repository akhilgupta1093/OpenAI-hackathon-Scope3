Our development of autonomous vehicles (AV) provides an example of 
increased capital availability due to investor interest and the potential 
for new revenue opportunities. Cruise, our global segment responsible 
for the development and commercialization of AV technology, has 
attracted funding from financial and strategic investors, including 
Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. This capital infusion, combined with our 
funding and collaboration, is enabling Cruise and GM to accelerate their 
efforts to commercialize self-driving vehicles. Learn more in the
