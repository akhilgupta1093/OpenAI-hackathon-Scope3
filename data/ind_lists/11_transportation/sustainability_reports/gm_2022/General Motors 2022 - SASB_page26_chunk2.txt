(cont.)Risk: Competition from peers in transition to EVs potentially 
impacting company sales and market share
Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to: deliver a broad portfolio 
of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer demands; 
reduce the costs associated with manufacturing EVs, particularly with 
respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density 
of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and 
related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to 
our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, 
manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles
