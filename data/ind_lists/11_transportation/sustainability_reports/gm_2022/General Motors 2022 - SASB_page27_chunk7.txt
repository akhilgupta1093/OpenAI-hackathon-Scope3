In addition, AVs—particularly those that are passenger cars—could 
significantly affect the country’s ability to cut GHG emissions and move 
toward a carbon-free economy. Existing studies  suggest that three 
main factors will determine whether putting more AVs on the road 
increases or decreases tailpipe carbon emissions: effect on the total 
vehicle-miles traveled in the United States; impacts on congestion; and 
AV fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption. As such, AVs must be 
assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on carbon 
emissions levels
