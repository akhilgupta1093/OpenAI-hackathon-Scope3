• GM and Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement to develop 
a Lunar Mobility Vehicle that will enable astronauts to explore 
the lunar surface farther than ever before as part of NASA’s 
Artemis  program to send humans back to the moon. 
• In early 2022, GM announced plans to develop multiple 
HYDROTEC fuel cell-based power generators that will provide 
mobile DC fast charging capability for EVs without imposing on 
the grid. These HYDROTEC fuel cell generators could ultimately 
replace gas- and diesel-burning generators with zero-emissions 
technology in a variety of places, as well as provide backup 
power during power disruptions. 
• GM has an agreement to supply HYDROTEC fuel cell power 
cubes to Navistar for use in its production model fuel cell 
electric vehicle (FCEV)—the International® RH™ Series. The 
FCEV is expected to receive energy from two GM HYDROTEC 
fuel cell power cubes. Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 (2.4a) response for more
