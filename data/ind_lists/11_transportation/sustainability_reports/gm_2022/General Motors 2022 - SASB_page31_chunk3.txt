The Role of the Board and Senior Management
The Board has the overall responsibility for risk oversight, with a focus 
on the most significant risks facing the company, including climate 
change. While GM does not follow the precautionary approach, the 
company does have a comprehensive risk management plan in place. 
The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and 
through delegation to Board Committees. Each of the Board Committees 
is responsible for oversight of risk management practices for categories 
of risks relevant to its functions, with the GCRC being responsible for 
risks related to the sustainability of our operations and products. 
The process and terminology in place for assessing relative significance 
of all identified risks, including climate-related risks such as increased 
and more stringent GHG emission regulations, is as follows: â€¢ Risks and opportunities are assessed based on probability of 
occurrence and impact to our financials, strategy and/or reputation
