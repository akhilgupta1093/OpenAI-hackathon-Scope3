303-5 Water consumption GM calculates water consumption based on water withdrawal times, an engineering calculation for evaporation of 30%. Using the 
formula withdrawal minus discharge provides close to zero consumption due to groundwater infiltration at plant sites. GM experiences 
water stress at three sites in Mexico and two sites in China. We have mitigated the risk by conservation, recycling or reusing wastewater 
in the manufacturing process. Additionally, at one site in China, the government has provided a backup source of water to mitigate water 
stress risk
