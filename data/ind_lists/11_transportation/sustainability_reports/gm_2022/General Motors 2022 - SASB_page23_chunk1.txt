We recognize that our impact as a business extends to the opportunity 
to help people thrive in a better, more sustainable world. That is why we 
are working toward a zero-emissions future, which will require actions 
beyond just accelerating EV adoption. We plan to become carbon 
neutral in our global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate 
tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. We continue 
working toward our target of sourcing 100% renewable energy to 
power our U.S. operations by 2025 and our global operations by 2035. 
In 2021, GM partnered with a third-party consultant to begin a two-
year journey to better define the companyâ€™s climate-related risks and 
opportunities. The focus is to identify climate-related risks, exposure, 
potential impacts and key performance indicators. In particular, this 
journey will include climate change scenarios and business alignment 
with various climate-related scenarios. Progress on this exercise will  
be shared in our 2022 TCFD disclosure
