CO2 Governance Committee 
GM is focused on reducing CO2 emissions from use of sold products, 
primarily by transitioning its product line to all-electric vehicles. GM

CO2 governance process includes senior-level representation from all 
relevant functions, including product development, planning, sales and 
marketing, finance, public policy and legal
