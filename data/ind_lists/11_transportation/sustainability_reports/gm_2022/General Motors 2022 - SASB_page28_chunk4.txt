Opportunity: Leadership in electrification and fuel cell 
innovation leading to new sales and market opportunities 
Our business growth model is predicated on leveraging leading 
positions in electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, autonomy and 
connected vehicles—positions that are transforming GM from 
automaker to platform innovator.  
The unique modularity and flexibility of the Ultium platform opens 
opportunities beyond our own vehicles. Ultium, together with our 
Hydrotec fuel cell platform, gives GM the potential to transform  
planes, trains, automobiles and boats into all-electric products.  
In 2021, GM made the following moves to extend zero emissions 
beyond automotive vehicles:
• GM and Wabtec Corporation entered into a nonbinding 
memorandum of understanding to leverage our Ultium battery 
and HYDROTEC  fuel cell technologies for Wabtec locomotives.
