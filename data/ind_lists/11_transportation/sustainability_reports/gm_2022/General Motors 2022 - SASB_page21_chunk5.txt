Sustainability Office (SO)
Management of climate-related risks and opportunities ultimately 
resides with the CEO, who leads our SLT. This group includes the 
executive vice president of global manufacturing to whom our chief 
sustainability officer (CSO) reports. The group is responsible for ensuring 
climate-related considerations are incorporated into the company’s

processes. The CSO chairs the SO and works cross-functionally to 
integrate sustainability across the enterprise
