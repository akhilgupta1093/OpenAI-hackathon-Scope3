To support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that 
our customers will have access to comprehensive charging solutions. 
For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging 
needs at residences, the workplace and in public locations. For fleet

energy management services.

In 2021, we announced a new Dealer Community Charging Program to 
install up to 40,000 Level 2 EV chargers across the United States and 
Canada through 2025. Working with our dealers, we intend to expand 
access to charging in local communities, including in underserved, 
rural and urban areas where EV charging access is often limited. This 
initiative, which is expected to begin in 2022, is part of our commitment 
to invest nearly $750 million to expand residence, workplace and public 
charging infrastructure through the Ultium Charge 360 ecosystem 
through 2025. The investment includes the addition of 3,250 EVgo DC
