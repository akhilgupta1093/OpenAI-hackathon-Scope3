GM approaches relevant climate-related risks on a risk-by-risk basis. 
The physical and transition risks identified earlier in this document  
are relevant to different parts of the business. For example, the risk  
of increased flooding and extreme weather events impacting the 
production, logistics and procurement of products from suppliers is 
managed by our GPSC organization. Securing consistent, resilient and 
sustainable supply chains for key materials is a strategic priority for 
GPSC. The organization maintains a “command center” that monitors 
real-time conditions and data from multiple sources to identify such 
events around the world and map them to our suppliers. In the event  
of an anticipated or actual disruption, alerts are quickly sent to  
the relevant teams internally, and contingency plans are created  
and implemented
