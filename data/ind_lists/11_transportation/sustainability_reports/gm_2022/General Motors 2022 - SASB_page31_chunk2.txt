As part of our comprehensive climate change strategy, we identify and 
monitor climate-related risks on a regular basis across our business. 
The need for this constant process reflects the volatility of risk factors 
and dynamics that can quickly change scenarios. By institutionalizing 
climate change risks as part of our enterprise risk management 
function, we believe GM is better positioned to anticipate, detect and, 
ultimately, plan around these changes
