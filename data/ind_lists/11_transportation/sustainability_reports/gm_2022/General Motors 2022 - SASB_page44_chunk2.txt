 3.  GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilitiesâ€™ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small facilities 
(offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source. Intensity is calculated by 
withdrawal/vehicle production (M-Schedule where we monitor water use)
