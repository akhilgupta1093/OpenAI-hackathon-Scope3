In 2021, key activities included holding energy and water treasure 
hunts and virtual symposia for suppliers. Energy treasure hunts 
collectively provided recommendations to save 3,300 MWh of energy 
and 6,600 cubic meters of water and to eliminate 3,158 MT of CO2 
emissions. Also in 2021, GPSC increased participation among selected 
suppliers in its annual CDP Supply Chain Initiative to over 98% of 
surveyed suppliers. Learn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility
