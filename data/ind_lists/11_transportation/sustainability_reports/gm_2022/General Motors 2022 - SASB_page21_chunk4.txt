Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C1.1, C1.1a, C1.1b) 
as well as GM’s 2022 Proxy Statement , beginning on page 6, for 
further discussion of Board oversight on ESG measures. The company’s risk governance is facilitated through a top-down and 
bottom-up structure, with the tone established at the top by the Board 
Chair and CEO, who is also our chief risk officer, and other members of 
management, specifically the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT 
also utilizes our Risk Advisory Council, an executive-level body with 
delegates from each business unit, to discuss and monitor the most 
significant enterprise and emerging risks in a cross-functional setting. 
They are tasked with championing risk management practices and 
integrating them into their functional or regional business units
