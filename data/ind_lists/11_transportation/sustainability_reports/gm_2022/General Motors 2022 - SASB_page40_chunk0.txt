 1.  Baseline year 2018, and includes all facilities under GM operational control. Calculation includes CO2, CH4 and N20. Reporting is based on GHG Protocol, and the source of emission factors is regulatory or IPCC Good Practice Guidelines. 
 2. GM’s Scope 1 emissions are generated from use of fossil fuels, mostly natural gas for process and building heat and are verified by an independent third party
