PG.14the tone of our growth include a focus on providing hiring opportunities 
for women and BIPOC minorities, without bias of gender identity. Our 
process consists of a purposeful interview panel design and the need  
to identify an applicant tracking software providing data-based  
decision-making.  
We formalized our first employee resource group, “Women of Fisker,” 
and its progress will influence the development of future employee 
resource groups. The “Women of Fisker” group extends to all levels of the 
organization with the company co-founder and CFO, Dr. Geeta Gupta-
Fisker, as executive sponsor. A charter for the organization has been 
developed and will be ratified in 2022
