PG.22"We plan to radically disrupt the mobility 
industry by setting an ambitious goal  
for ourselves: to produce a climate-neutral 
vehicle by 2027 . We put people and the planet 
at the forefront of our mission, ensuring a clean 
future for all." â€” Henrik Fisker 
Production of the Fisker Ocean, our first vehicle, 
begins in November 2022. From sketch through 
to the first prototype, our values, purpose, and 
aspirational goals dominate our conversations 
and actions.  Fisker
