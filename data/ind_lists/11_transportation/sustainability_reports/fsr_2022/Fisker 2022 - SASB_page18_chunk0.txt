• Direct-to-consumer sales: We own our consumer 
experience from reservation through purchasing  
and last-mile delivery with an expressed focus  
on providing a transparent, quality acquisition and 
ownership experienceConsumer Experience  
Fisker is rethinking every aspect of the 
consumer experience. We purposefully 
designed a frustration-free ownership model, 
ensuring a friendly and engaging experience 
with easy, efficient solutions from reservation, 
acquisition, service, and end-of-use.    
Customer relations moves past traditional 
"required maintenance" models into "predictive 
maintenance" identification with proactive 
alerts.  We are transforming the service 
narrative into an on-site or pick-up and drop-off 
service aligned with an owner's schedule  
to maximize convenience. 
Fisker aligns strategies to our customer values, 
and increasing Fisker Ocean reservations  
at individual and fleet levels supports this belief.  
Financing options  
Fisker's nominated financial institution 
partnerships purposefully designed loan 
flexibility into the decision-making process  
for consumers choosing personal 
transportation, supporting a seamless 
financing experience. 
• Purchase the vehicle outright  
• Lease with high annual mileage 
allowances and zero-commitment  
term flexibility  
These choices are available because of our 
confidence in Fisker vehicles, industry-leading 
warranties, and an expectation of lower 
maintenance and better performance over the 
lifetime of our vehicles.
