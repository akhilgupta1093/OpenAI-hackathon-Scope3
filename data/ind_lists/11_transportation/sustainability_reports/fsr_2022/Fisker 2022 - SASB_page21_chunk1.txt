Our Fisker Ocean life cycle analysis is informed 
by environmental management frameworks, 
such as ISO 14040, ISO 14044, and ISO 14067 . 
Considerations within each phase of the life 
cycle analysis are discussed. We will release 
calculation results in 2023 to inform our 
progress towards our aspirational goal of a 
climate-neutral vehicle by 2027 . Planning for the 
climate-neutral vehicle is ongoing, and we will 
publish more details later in 2022
