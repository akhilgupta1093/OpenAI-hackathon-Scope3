PG.27* Automotive-grade metals typically contain between 5-10% recycled material 
**Based on competitive benchmarking of other OEMs (track, width, wheel base) 
***Carbon Footprint, derived from Ecoinvent 3.7 .1 datasets 
Calculations based on: 
• 400 kg body-in-white, typical for a vehicle of similar size and type 
• Body-in-white carbon footprint from production expected to represent 18% of overall PEAR 
vehicle carbon footprint 
• Baseline material mix assumed to be 53% Steel; 47% Aluminum by mass  
 
Material Substitution Findings 
• Incorporating steel with 50% recycled content will yield the highest reduction in the body-in-
white’s CFP , thereby reducing PEAR’s overall CFP by 12%
• Incorporating aluminum with 10% recycled content will yield the highest increase in the body-in-
white’s CFP , thereby increasing PEAR’s overall CFP by 12%  
Mass Reduction Findings 
• Reducing the body-in-white’s mass by 25% will reduce the body-in-white’s CFP by 25%,  
thereby decreasing PEAR’s overall CFP by 5%  
Overall 
• Reducing the body-in-white’s mass by 25% AND incorporating steel with 50% recycled content 
will yield a 73% reduction in the body-in-white’s CFP , thereby reducing PEAR’s overall CFP by 13%MaterialΔMass
