Case Study: Materials Engineering Study 
The Fisker approach to continuous improvement is obsessive. Engineers conducted a materials 
analysis striving for the perfect balance of sustainability, safety, quality, and cost. Key closure 
components and the "body-in-white" (manufacturing stage when the vehicle frame has been fused, 
before paint or parts) were analyzed to find an optimal material mix, including recycled materials 
and mass. Results identified significant potential for reducing carbon footprint and will prompt a 
future reengineering toward reaching our aspiration to create a carbon-neutral vehicle. Learnings 
from this study will reduce the “body-in-white" and overall mass of the Fisker PEAR, the second 
vehicle from Fisker expected to begin production in 2024.
