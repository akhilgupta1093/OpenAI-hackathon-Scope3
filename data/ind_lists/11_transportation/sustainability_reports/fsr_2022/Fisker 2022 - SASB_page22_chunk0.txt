PG.23Fisker carefully chooses high-quality, like-minded partners to reach our 
vision. We set expectations through our Responsible Supplier Policy . 
Suppliers moving forward have agreed to this policy, along with annual 
adherence verification. 
“We will strive to use the least water and yield the lowest emissions  
in our supply chain, materials, and processes. We commit to following 
a path of continual improvement through scientific measurement, audit 
processes, and meaningful targets. We expect our suppliers to commit 
to these same values and help us to achieve the lightest footprint on our 
planet."—Responsible Supplier Policy  
We recognize the challenges of producing and delivering products 
without greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The supply chains of our 
suppliers and logistics partners may contain offsets to achieve climate 
neutrality. Fisker will not purchase offsets, and our goal is to utilize only 
climate-neutral materials in our products and use only climate-neutral 
services to support our business.Choosing Suppliers  1. Upstream Materials Sourcing  1.Upstream Materials Sourcing
