Community Engagement    
A conscience consideration of where we live, 
work, and play harmonizes perfectly with our 
sustainability outlook. While headquartered 
in California, our diverse workforce makes us 
global citizens. How we work, what and how 
we produce products, and our ambition align  
with our collective environmental stewardship. 
As we grow, so does our social and 
environmental responsibility, and we continue 
to develop our social accountability in ways 
that relate to our business and employees.    
Beyond the natural contribution of our  
products, Fisker reaches the community in two 
additional ways:     
• As a California-based company, the 
Pacific Ocean is a cherished reminder 
of our relationship with the environment. 
Fisker employees participate in bi-annual 
beach clean-ups, combing the sands and 
filling commercial-sized bags with beach 
plastic and other discarded materials. 
The bags are then post-sorted for any potential re-use and recycling. The events 
are highly successful, based on employee 
participation. At a recent event, in addition 
to the physical clean-up, employees were 
presented with an interactive, informational 
session on ocean pollution and the 
ecological impact of micro-plastics  
with environmental activist, pro surfer, and 
Fisker brand ambassador Zane Kekoa 
Schweitzer and Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker. 
The Fisker Ocean, scheduled to launch in 
November, incorporates captured ocean 
plastic within the carpet material lining the 
interior of the electric vehicle.  
• Henrik Fisker's hand drawing of the 
Fisker Ocean was translated into an NFT 
and auctioned through energy-efficient 
blockchain partner Solana. Fisker Inc. 
donated a portion of the funds raised to the 
Ocean Conservancy. Emissions related  
to the energy consumed from the 
transactions will be offset by donations  
to forest conservation in Brazil in perpetuity.
