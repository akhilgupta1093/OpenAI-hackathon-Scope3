2021 Safe Return to Office
COVID-19 prompted a fully remote work environment for nearly all employees. 
A comprehensive playbook on safely returning to work has proven successful. 
Actions included:   
• Physical entry protocols   
• PPE provisions   
• Healthcare screen via an external partner   
• Exposure/response protocols and contact tracing   
• Required vaccination for all in-office employees   
• Continual policy updates, accommodating regulation changes and  
CDC guidelines   
• Hybrid work model to reduce office population hot spots   
Employee feedback also solidified a hybrid work practice that began  
as a method to help employees stay safe with COVID-19 and developed  
into a true hybrid work model. Considerations for the environment  
by avoiding commuting emissions were part of the determination, and we 
are calculating the benefits of such a decision. Most employees work  
in the office two days a week and remotely for three. A cross-functional 
team reviewed the hybrid work strategy and created a policy aligned  
with employee work/life balance and reduced employee commuting.
