PG.25Fisker works to localize manufacturing with inbound materials, plans  
to maximize rail and electric-power transport, and challenges  
logistics partners to support the aspirational goal to create a  
climate-neutral vehicle. 3. Inbound/Outbound Logistics Fisker Ocean production in Graz, Austria is planned for November 2022 
through collaboration with Magna in a carbon-neutral facility powered 
by electricity sourced from 100% renewable energy. An additional 
photovoltaic energy source will be dedicated to Fisker production. 
Magna teams have diligently identified Fisker Ocean processes and are 
isolating data to provide water and energy usage. Magna will support 
Fisker in reporting Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Before 
the first Fisker Ocean rolls off the production line, 14 UN SDG-aligned key 
performance indicator topics across environmental and social factors 
have been set: 2. Manufacturing/Production

Our first step toward developing a climate-neutral vehicle is the  
Fisker Ocean, an all-electric SUV featuring SolarSky, a rooftop solar  
panel supplementing battery power. SolarSky can add up to 1,500 miles  
of range annually, enhancing the Fisker Ocean's 250-350 mile  
per charge range.  4. Product Use
