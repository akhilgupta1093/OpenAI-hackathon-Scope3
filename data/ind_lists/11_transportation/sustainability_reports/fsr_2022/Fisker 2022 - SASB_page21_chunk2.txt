"We applaud this lifecycle commitment," —  
The Carbon Collective  “At Fisker, striving for innovation in sustainability is 
what we stand for. It is not only a brand strategy;  
it is why we exist. In Engineering, we are constantly 
looking to improve the efficiency of our vehicles. 
We analyze the entire vehicle and materials 
manufacturing process to preserve the vehicle and 
its contents for as long as possible because how it’s 
made matters. 
 We understand it is not just what we create and how 
our products perform but also the raw materials and 
what happens to them when we are finished. This 
is the full life-cycle approach, and we will always 
strive to be the best and radically change the 
industry for the lightest footprint possible.“ —
