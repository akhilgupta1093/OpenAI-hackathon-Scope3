Like many in 2020 and 2021, Fisker offices 
moved from fully remote into an employee-
preferred hybrid model with employees 
working from home and our two offices. The 
hybrid model supported our employees' 
interest in managing work/life balance and  
our low environmental-impact values. In 2022, 
we will continue studying how to improve  
this hybrid work model and incorporate 
employee feedback.  Emissions 
Fisker emissions tracking is gaining  
momentum. In 2021, we reported Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions, laying the groundwork  
for continued improvement. Ahead  
of production, our offices are the most 
significant contributor to our footprint.
