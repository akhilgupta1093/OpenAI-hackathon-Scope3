Grid outages are becoming more common
Electrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common, predominantly due to weather and natural 
disasters. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electrical disturbances cost businesses $150 billion per 
year. It is not surprising that homeowners and businesses are increasingly turning to backup power supply 
options. Our solar and energy storage products are a great way to reduce emissions while also ensuring backup 
power during outages. 
Low cost is key to mass adoption
We are continuously working on reducing the cost of our products in order to foster mass adoption. Ultimately, 
using renewable energy (such as solar or wind) with battery storage will become the cheapest energy option 
available, regardless of location. This is already the case in many, but not all, locations around the world. As the 
cost continues to decline, more customers will be able to financially benefit from turning to renewable energy.
