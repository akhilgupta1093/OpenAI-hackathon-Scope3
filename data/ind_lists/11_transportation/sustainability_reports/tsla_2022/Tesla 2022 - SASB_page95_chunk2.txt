Every battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re -manufactured is recycled
Tesla batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles and our energy storage products, are made to last 
many years, and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field. Most batteries that 
Tesla recycles today are pre- consumer, coming to us through R&D and quality control. None of our scrapped 
lithium -ion batteries go to landfills and 100% are recycled. Furthermore, Tesla has an established internal 
ecosystem to re -manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively implement 
circular economy principles and consider all other options before opting for battery recycling
