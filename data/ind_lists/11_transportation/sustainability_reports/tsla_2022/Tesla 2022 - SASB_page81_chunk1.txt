Customers who choose to be a part of this program receive a Safety ScoreBeta. This score changes based on 
driving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it. Instead of determining a driver’s insurance 
premiums from demographic information (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit score), our algorithm calculates Safety Score
Betabased on actual driver behavior. The behaviors we monitor are: 
•Forward Collision Warnings
•Hard Braking
•Aggressive Turning
•Unsafe Following (Tailgating) 
•Forced Autopilot Disengagement  
Our data show a lower rate of collision for the cohort of customers who have enabled Safety ScoreBeta.  As the 
vehicle’s Safety ScoreBetaincreases, the number of collisions per mile decreases and insurance premiums reduce.Vehicle Safety
