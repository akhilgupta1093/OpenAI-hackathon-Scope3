The impact of stock -based compensation can be material for employees
Our employees have benefited enormously from value appreciation of our stock seen through the years. While 
share prices will remain volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results, stock -based 
compensation brings shared ownership to the workforce, and our employees are encouraged to make a positive 
change for the benefit of all. Culturally, shared ownership of the company is one of the most essential attributes of working at Tesla. 
For example, assume that an employee received a grant of 320 Tesla shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares 
quarterly over 16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly vest of 20 
Tesla shares would equate to $1,331 -worth of sellable shares at the end of 2018. However, the same vest two 
years later would equate to $14,113 -worth of sellable shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per 
share of Tesla stock over that period. Employees are also eligible to buy additional stock at a discount through the Employee Stock Purchase Program.People and Culture
