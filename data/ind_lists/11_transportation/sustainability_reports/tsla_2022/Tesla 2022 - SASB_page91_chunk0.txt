The best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your reliance on the grid. Tesla is a one -stop shop for taking our 
customers off -grid by covering a large variety of their needs. In 2021, Tesla sold 4 GWh worth of energy storage 
products, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global market*. Some of these projects were massive deployments, 
including a 371 MWh installation in California and a 497 MWh installation in Victoria, Australia. In order to switch 
global energy usage to renewable sources, we estimate that global annual battery storage production will need to increase to ~10,000 GWh
