This will be the last year that we present recordable injuries per car produced â€“which captures all injuries and 
illness regardless of their severity or relation to work. Instead, we will use the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) standard E2920 -19.ASTM better represents our global reach and more clearly illuminates 
serious injuries and illnesses, allowing our focus to remain on preventing and mitigating outcomes of our 
highest -risk activities
