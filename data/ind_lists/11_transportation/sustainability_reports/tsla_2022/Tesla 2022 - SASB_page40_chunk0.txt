41Connecting communities to opportunities with Tesla
During the global pandemic, we focused a great deal on expanding our community engagement and ensuring 
our employees stayed connected. Specifically, we expanded our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and 
ensured our programming was accessible in a remote work environment. We welcomed Asian Pacific Islanders 
at T esla to our ERG family. While this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our 
employees felt more heard and connected than ever before as they pivoted to virtual events to promote inclusion across different locations, physical boundaries and time zones
