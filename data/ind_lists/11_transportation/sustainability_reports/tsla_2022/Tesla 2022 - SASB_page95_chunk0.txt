Extracting raw 
materialsA common question we receive is: “What happens to T esla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?” 
An important distinction between fossil fuels and lithium -ion batteries as an energy source is that while fossil 
fuels are extracted and used once, the materials in a lithium -ion battery are recyclable. When petroleum is 
pumped out of the ground, chemically refined and then burned, it releases toxic emissions into the atmosphere 
that are not recoverable for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast, are refined and put into a cell and will remain in 
the cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled to recover valuable materials for reuse, repeatedly
