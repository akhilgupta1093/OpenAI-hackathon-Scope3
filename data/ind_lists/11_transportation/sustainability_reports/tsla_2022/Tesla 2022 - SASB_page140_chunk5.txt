•CO2emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor by the volume of 
diesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s on -road and non- road vehicles for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. 
•CH4and N2O emissions were calculated by multiplying the relevant emission factor 
(depending on vehicle type and age) by the miles driven by Tesla’s on -road vehicles, and by 
the volume of diesel and gasoline used by Tesla’s non -road vehicles, for the year ended 
December 31, 2021. 
•Emission factors: U.S. EPA Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories 2022. 
•Process emissions (Gigafactory Nevada lithium -ion battery cell recycling plant): 
•Emissions from processing manufacturing scrap lithium -ion cells at the Gigafactory Nevada 
cell recycling plant.  
•The quantity of manufacturing scrap processed was collected from Tesla’s cell recycling plant 
operations team. The concentration of CO2and CH4in emissions (emission rates) were 
measured during two emissions source tests. GHG emissions were calculated by multiplying 
the quantity of manufacturing scrap processed, as recorded by the recycling plant operations 
team, by the CO2and CH4emission rates developed based on emissions source tests. 
•Estimated emissions from the sources above account for approximately 10% of Scope 1 GHG 
emissions
