27Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day & National Manufacturing Day
To promote gender diversity in STEM, since 2018, Tesla has encouraged girls to see engineering as a means to
pursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year, over 1,200 middle school 
students from 140 schools across California, Nevada, Texas and New York joined the virtual event which 
showcased a variety of engineering career pathways and inspiring female Tesla engineers through virtual tours, 
engaging videos and hands -on STEM activities. Similar initiatives take place in Europe, like Girlsâ€™ Day, which is 
dedicated to girls who want to explore future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage and inspire 
them via factory tour visits and conversations with our female employees and leaders
