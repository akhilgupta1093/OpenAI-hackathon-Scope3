Compliance & Audit Group Established
We established the Compliance Audit Program in 2021 to provide an objective assessment of the management 
of EHS&S risk at a site level throughout the various businesses. We have conducted 31 audits so far that:
•Focused on compliance with T esla EHS&S standards and regulatory requirements
•Engaged site -level EHS&S professionals to audit other Tesla sites, maximizing technical knowledge across the 
businesses
•Identified best practices that can be replicated across other sites
•Provided guidance and assistance to sites addressing and closing out corrective and preventive actions
The audit outcomes provided opportunities for workers to identify and employ improvement solutions, adjust 
to the changing work environment where necessary, verify and validate existing safeguards, and implement new 
safeguards and improve our overall capacity.
