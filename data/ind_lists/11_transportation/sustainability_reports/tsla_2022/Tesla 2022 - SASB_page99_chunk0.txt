100The unique T esla approach: Going directly to the source
The implementation of an OECD -aligned approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following 
two pillars:
1.Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple processing 
steps by different companies, some of the more important environmental and social risks in this supply chain 
are present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from mining companies allows Tesla to engage directly in local 
contexts instead of having to rely on multiple midstream companies that typically sit between EV makers 
and mining. It also enables more transparent and traceable supply chains and better environmental and 
social data. In 2021, Tesla procured >95% of lithium hydroxide, >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel-
containing (NCA and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies. All nine binding 
contracts include environmental and social requirements. As T eslaâ€™s battery supply chain continues to scale, 
Tesla expects the proportion of directly sourced minerals to increase
