EVs as the Primary VehicleCustomers are using their Tesla as their main car
For an EV to have an impact on the environment, it must be genuinely displacing internal combustion engine 
miles, rather than sitting in the driveway as a secondary car used for errands or short trips only. Our data shows 
that Tesla vehicles are being driven more than average vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally 
being used as a customer’s primary vehicle. We fundamentally believe that you shouldn’t have to choose 
between price, quality, usability and sustainability. An EV should be the best vehicle in every way, so consumers don’t ever need to use ICE vehicles
