652.  Covering roof space with solar panels
All our new factories are designed to be covered with solar panels. As of the end of 2021, we had installed solar 
panels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority installed on the roofs of Gigafactory Nevada, 
Gigafactory New York and our manufacturing facilities in California. We will continue to add more capacity to 
these and other facilities as space allows and as is economically feasible
