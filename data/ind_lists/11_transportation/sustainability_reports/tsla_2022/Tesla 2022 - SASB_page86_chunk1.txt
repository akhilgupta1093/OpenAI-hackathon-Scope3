Post-Crash Data Analysis
After we send new software to the fleet, we wait for new data to come through to understand the efficacy of 
the system once it is deployed in the real world. Since deployment of our ‘ offzone ’ side algorithm (data -driven 
safety), we learned that of the total vehicles that had their airbags deployed, 15% of those deployed due to our 
new algorithm in these new modes. This confirms our expectations and highlights how effective fleet -based 
learnings and rapid deployment of novel solutions can be. 
Why Airbags Sometimes Don’t Deploy
In a fairly common “small overlap” collision as the one shown below, front sensors are unlikely to pick up a side 
collision, as they are usually designed to detect a frontal collision. And side sensors are usually too close to a 
driver window to detect a collision far in the front. We designed our sensors and their positions in a way that 
they can pick up nearly every type of collision and deploy airbags if necessary. Vehicle Safety
