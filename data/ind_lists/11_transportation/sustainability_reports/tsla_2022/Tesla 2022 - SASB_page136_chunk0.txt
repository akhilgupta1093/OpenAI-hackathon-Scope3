L'Automobile To calculate scrappage age of vehicles in a region, sum up annual vehicle sales from the most current year going 
back until the sum equals the current vehicle parc size. In order to be conservative, and normalize our figure based on recent vehicle sales trends in each region, we divided total vehicle parc by average vehicles sales in the respective regions for 2019 and 2020 (latest available data). This resulted in a scrappage age of 17 years and 
200,000 miles in the U.S. and 20 years and 150,000 miles for Europe. For simplicity, China assumed to have similar 
useful life to Europe of approximately 20 years and 150,000 miles.

Combination Trucks % of U.S. Fleet and U.S. Vehicle Emissions U.S. EPA, U.S. Department of Transportation% of U.S. Vehicle Fleet chart figures calculated using vehicle parc figures from U.S. Department of Transportation. % 
of U.S. Vehicle Emissions chart figures estimated using vehicle parc, fuel economy and VMT data from U.S. 
Department of Transportation. Calculation assumes fuel emissions factor for combination trucks are the same as the rest of the vehicle parc and are therefore conservative. Combination trucks use diesel fuel which, according to the 
U.S. EPA, has a higher GHG content versus gasoline used for light duty cars and trucks
