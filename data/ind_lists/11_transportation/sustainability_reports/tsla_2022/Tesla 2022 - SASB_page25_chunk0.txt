We are continuing to provide the local community access to thousands of job openings across the U.S. in 
manufacturing, vehicle service and solar roof installation, offering full benefits and training from day one. We 
have long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college degree to work at Tesla. This represents 
an enormous opportunity for high school graduates from underserved communities to join us in our mission and 
grow their careers
