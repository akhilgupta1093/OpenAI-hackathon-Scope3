Second, modern factories are better designed for material flow. Trailer entry points surround the whole factory, 
which means that components can be offloaded precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less 
material flow results in less waste, because a shorter journey requires less protective packaging. The chart 
below shows that waste generation per vehicle at Gigafactory Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S. 
We are expecting our upcoming factories such as Gigafactory Berlin- Brandenburg and Gigafactory T exas to 
continue the same trend
