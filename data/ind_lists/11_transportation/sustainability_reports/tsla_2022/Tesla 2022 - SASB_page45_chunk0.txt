Disaster ReliefHurricane Ida
In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, T esla worked with NGO partners such as the Footprint Project, and certified 
installers in the New Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives, Posigen ) to deploy Powerwall and solar panel disaster 
relief systems. We deployed 14 systems to over 10 sites, including food distribution centers, churches, a 
warehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs. Most systems stayed in place for six weeks 
while the grid was down; in cases where the building was too damaged to return power after the grid was back up the systems remained in place for substantially longer. Our partners estimate that these systems provided 
power to over 1,000 people including recovery workers, food distribution volunteers and first responders
