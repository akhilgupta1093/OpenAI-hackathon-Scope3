Super -fast charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes
Around 300 miles of range at highway speeds is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers 
are often likely to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively short before 
continuing the journey. Our latest generation of Superchargers can recover up to 200 miles of range in just 15 
minutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack
