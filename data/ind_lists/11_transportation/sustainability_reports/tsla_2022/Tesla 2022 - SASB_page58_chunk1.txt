Equivalent ICE VehiclesOn the following pages, we will show the per mile lifecycle emissions of our vehicles
This includes emissions from upstream supply chain, direct emissions from manufacturing and electricity 
consumption and use -phase emissions when charged from a grid with a generation mix that reflects the 
geographic distribution of Model 3 and Model Y deliveries in the U.S., Europe and China. Below are the lifecycle 
emissions scenarios we show, and the assumptions used in each of the charts on the following pages:
Average Premium ICE: The reference ICE vehicle is based on an average of mid -size premium sedans and mid -
size premium crossover SUVs, with a real- world fuel economy of 24.3 MPG
