Continuous product improvement
Tesla pioneered the concept of vehicles that improve and become more capable over time by ensuring that 
every Tesla vehicle made since 2012 can accept over -the-air (OTA) software updates. These updates have 
introduced new features and functionality that have made our vehicles smarter, safer and more enjoyable to 
drive. We have also used the OTA system to ensure that our vehicles are not only as secure as possible when 
they are delivered, but that they continue to stay as secure as possible throughout their lifetime.Corporate Governance
