•Global electricity usage data was collected from monthly utility invoices obtained from 
third -party providers.  
•The WRI and WBSCD issued additional guidance for Scope 2 emissions in 2015 (in GHG 
Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, An amendment to the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard), 
which sets forth reporting under both location- based and market -based 
methodologies, where the prior version of the GHG Protocol only addressed a location -
based methodology. The location -based method applies average emission factors that 
correspond to the grid where the consumption occurs, whereas the market -based 
method applies emission factors that correspond to energy purchased through 
contractual instruments. Where contractual instruments were not purchased, the 
market -based emission factors represent either the residual mix, where available, or the 
location grid -average factors. This management assertion only includes Tesla’s location -
based Scope 2 GHG emissions as Tesla is continuing to implement its processes to measure and report its market -based Scope 2 GHG emissions
