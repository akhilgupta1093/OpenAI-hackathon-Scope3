Disaster ReliefSupporting Ukraine
We are committed to providing disaster relief through product donations. Our relief efforts to the conflict in 
Ukraine have provided people with the ability to communicate and power communities. 
In March 2022, Tesla employees in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy the first 50 kits 
containing Powerwalls, Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When 
paired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power plants 
can assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls
