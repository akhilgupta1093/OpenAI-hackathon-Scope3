48Develop tools to drive execution of EHS&S â€”MyEHS
In order to build capacity and allow our workers to fail safely, we needed a more dynamic approach to how we 
collect and manage data that allows us to make decisions that reduce risk. In response to that need, we 
developed an internal EHS&S tool named MyEHS to help drive execution and improve outcomes by allowing the 
intake and visualization of data globally. We designed and deployed 11 modules in 2021, allowing us to better manage our EHS&S information, identify emerging risks and take action to implement improvements suggested by our employees
