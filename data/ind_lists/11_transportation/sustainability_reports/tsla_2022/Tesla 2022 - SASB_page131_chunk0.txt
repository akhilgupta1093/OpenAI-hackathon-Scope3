132Managing a successful and effective Impact program requires robust engagement with an entire ecosystem of 
stakeholders –both internal and external to Tesla –including our employees, customers, investors, suppliers, 
non-profit organizations, educational institutions, governments, the communities in which we operate and trade 
associations. These groups, among others, all have a stake in the success of our businesses —they are people or 
organizations who are affected by or can impact our operations. For our business to continue to grow, we need 
to keep innovating, developing new products and markets all in a sustainable manner. We do this by attracting 
and retaining the best employees, serving our customers and investors and working with non -profits, our local 
communities, schools, governments and trade associations to make a positive impact.Appendix
