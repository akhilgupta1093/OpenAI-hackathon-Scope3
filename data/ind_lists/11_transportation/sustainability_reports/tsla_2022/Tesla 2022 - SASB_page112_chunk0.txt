113Continuing to expand our audit program
In 2021, Tesla redefined its criteria for determining which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier Audit 
program. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the 
updated criteria expanded the scope to include significantly more suppliers globally. When we started our audit 
program, we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory Shanghai. We now have six factories across 
three different continents, and our production volume of vehicles has grown exponentially. As our global footprint and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion of our audit program was 
an important step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts continue to reflect the realities of our supply 
chain and can properly identify and address potential risks within our supply base
