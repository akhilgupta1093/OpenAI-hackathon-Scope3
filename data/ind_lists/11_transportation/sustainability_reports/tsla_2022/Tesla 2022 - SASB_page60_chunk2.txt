We used Austria as an example of how use -phase emissions should evolve once the European grid becomes 
greener. As seen in the chart on the right, in Austria, all -in lifecycle emissions of a personal, grid -charged Model 
3Y are over 3.5x lower than all -in lifecycle emissions of an equivalent ICE vehicle.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile
