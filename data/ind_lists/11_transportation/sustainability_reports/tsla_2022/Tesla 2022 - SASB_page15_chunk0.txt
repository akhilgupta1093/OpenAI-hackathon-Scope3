16Our compensation philosophy reflects our long -term mission and our startup origins. We emphasize structuring 
compensation to reward our named executive officers based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily 
in our named executive officers’ total compensation, including awards that vest upon the achievement of clear 
and measurable milestones. Since these awards increase in value as our stock price increases (and in the case of 
stock option awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following their grant), our named executive 
officers’ incentives are closely aligned with the long -term interests of our stockholders
