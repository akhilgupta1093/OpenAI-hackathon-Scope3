73Water Used Per Vehicle Manufactured
Current StateWe currently use less water per vehicle than almost any ICE carmaker
There is a misconception that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle. Our data 
shows this is not the case. While each automaker may draw their boundaries slightly differently (depending on 
how vertically integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available figures, Tesla withdrew less water 
at facilities dedicated to vehicle manufacturing per vehicle produced than the majority of established 
carmakers. Furthermore, the efficient manufacturing design we are implementing at our new factories in T exas and Berlin -Brandenburg will result in further reductions in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have 
industry -leading low water usage per vehicle, even when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below chart 
includes our latest estimates for water usage per vehicle at those facilities
