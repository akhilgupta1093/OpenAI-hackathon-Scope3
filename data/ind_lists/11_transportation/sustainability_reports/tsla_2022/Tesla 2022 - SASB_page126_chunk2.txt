Child Labor and Young Workers
Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the 
employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in 
Tesla products may be under the age of 15.Relationship with Communities
Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the 
communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of 
their operations on the local community, including with respect 
to environmental, social, and other quality of life factors.Indigenous Rights
The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw 
materials that go into our products has historically had an 
adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and 
communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate representatives of indigenous communities and include the right 
to free and informed consent in their operations.The following tables provide summaries of our responsible sourcing policies, the full text of which can be found on our Responsible Sourcing Policies page :
