Board role in risk oversight
The Board is responsible for overseeing the major risks facing Tesla, while management is responsible for 
assessing and mitigating Teslaâ€™s risks on a day -to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight of 
certain categories of risk to its independent committees, which then report to the Board, as appropriate, on 
matters that involve the specific areas of risk that each committee oversees.Corporate Governance
