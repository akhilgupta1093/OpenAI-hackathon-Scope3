112Tesla’s Supplier Audit program
In 2018, Tesla initiated its Supplier Audit program with the objective to extend our supplier performance 
evaluation to key environmental and social impact metrics relevant to Tesla’s business. This program extension 
was introduced at the time when T esla was transitioning from a small automotive manufacturer to a company 
gaining recognition as the leader in electrical vehicle production. We recognized that this growth came with an 
increased ability to impact positive change on the practices of our suppliers, but also with an increased responsibility to drive such change in line with our mission statement. During the program pilot phase, we 
focused our efforts on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially 
dangerous processes and/or chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts
