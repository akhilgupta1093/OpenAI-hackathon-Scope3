2021Emissions credit systems around the world are designed to economically benefit companies with non -polluting 
products by allowing them to sell their credits to polluting companies. In order to meet various countriesâ€™ 
emission targets and avoid government fines, polluting companies pay non -polluting companies through credit 
purchases. The goal of this system is for every OEM to be incentivized to reduce emissions and themselves 
become non -polluting by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another company for 
their non- polluting credits. 
Emissions credit revenue is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs
In 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero -emission regulatory credits to other OEMs. 
Proceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace 
ICE vehicles. While it is common practice today for ICE vehicle OEMs to purchase regulatory credits from other 
companies (such as Tesla) to offset their total GHG emissions, it is not a sustainable strategy. In order to meet 
increasingly strict regulatory requirements across the world, OEMs will be forced to develop truly competitive 
EVs
