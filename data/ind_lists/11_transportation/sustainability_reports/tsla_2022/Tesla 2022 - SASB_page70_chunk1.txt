Payload equal to a diesel truck
With both the U.S. and E.U. having approved higher weight allowances for electric heavy -duty trucks, we expect 
the payload to be at least as high as it would be for a diesel truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed to 
be 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel equivalents, and in the U.S. the allowance is 0.9 tons (2,000 
pounds). When fully loaded, the T esla Semi should be able to achieve over 500 miles of range, achieved through 
aerodynamics and highly efficient motors. This truck will be able to reach an efficiency of over 0.5 miles per 
kWh
