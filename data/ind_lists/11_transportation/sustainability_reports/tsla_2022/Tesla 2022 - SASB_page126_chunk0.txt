Tesla Human Rights Policy
Tesla believes the ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future and believe all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to 
support our mission and share our respect for human rights. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nat ion's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (“UDHR”). The UDHR 
focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain –including with respect to our 
employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the communities in which we operate
