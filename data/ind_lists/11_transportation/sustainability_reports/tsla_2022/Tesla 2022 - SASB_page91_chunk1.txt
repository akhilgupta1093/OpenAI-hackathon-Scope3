Residential customers: Solar Roof, solar panels and Powerwall
Anyone can dramatically reduce their carbon footprint by installing Solar Roof or solar panels with Powerwall. 
In theory, all U.S. domestic electricity needs, as well as vehicle transportation needs, could be met by sunlight 
alone. Naturally, installation of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer. In Massachusetts, 
for example, we estimate that an average solar and storage system pays for itself with energy cost savings 
within approximately 10 years. As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers will be willing to switch to solar and storage purely due to lower overall cost
