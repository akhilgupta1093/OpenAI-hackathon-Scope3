Tesla has pioneered the state- of-the-art way of improving a vehicle’s safety over time
A hallmark of Tesla ownership is connectivity. We are an industry leader in deploying over -the-air (OTA) 
software updates to our vehicles. These updates are integral to – and continuously enhance – the customer 
experience, and they can include improvements to customer safety or a remedy to a recall. OTA updates can be installed at a customer’s convenience without a trip to a Tesla Service Center.Vehicle Safety
