At Tesla, we strive to have a diverse supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities to provide 
goods and services as a part of the corporate procurement process. We formalized collaboration between the 
DEI, Supply Chain and Government Affairs teams to ensure local minority, women, LGBTQ+, disabled and veteran owned businesses are connected to opportunities with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity 
creates a competitive advantage for the company and has a positive impact on the global community. As the 
supplier diversity program develops, we will implement plans that encourage increased usage of diverse 
suppliers throughout our organization, partner with internal and external stakeholders to identify opportunities for diverse suppliers and work with external partners to encourage capacity building for diverse suppliers.People and Culture
