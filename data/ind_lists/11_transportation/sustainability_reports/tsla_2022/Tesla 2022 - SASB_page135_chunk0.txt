Manufacturing Phase Emissions for Average Mid -Size Premium ICE Tesla, Sphera SolutionsIn order to estimate the cradle -to-gate carbon footprints (GWP100) of select benchmark vehicles, a simplified 
approach of multiplying their curb weights by a carbon intensity of ~5.5 kg CO2e/kg was chosen. This reference 
value is based on a currently produced mid -size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of 
this estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of 
the reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different 
geographies and suppliers
