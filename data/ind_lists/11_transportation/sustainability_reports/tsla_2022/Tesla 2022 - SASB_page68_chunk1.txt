Use of product emissions
Tesla has access to primary data from our over two million vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and 
storage products —we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level of accuracy than most manufactures 
and can therefore develop emissions reduction solutions to match. This also means that we can calculate our use 
of product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions over the lifetime of the vehicle 
because we have primary data
