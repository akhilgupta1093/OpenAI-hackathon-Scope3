The longer the range, the lower the Supercharger use
Since its introduction in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over 50%: from 265 miles to 405 
miles of range for the long -range version. Our focus on energy efficiency —achieving superior range from the 
same size battery —has allowed to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively 
stable. Our data shows that the longer the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging T esla customers do. 
After all, day trips of over 400 miles are quite rare
