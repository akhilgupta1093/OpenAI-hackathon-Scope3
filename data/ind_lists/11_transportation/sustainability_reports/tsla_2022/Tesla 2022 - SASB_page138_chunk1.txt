2.GHG emissions quantification is subject to significant inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emissions factors that are used in mathematical models to 
calculate GHG emissions, and the inability of these models, due to incomplete scientific 
knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship 
between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use 
data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature 
and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different 
but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different amounts 
or metrics being reported.Site Type Site Activities
