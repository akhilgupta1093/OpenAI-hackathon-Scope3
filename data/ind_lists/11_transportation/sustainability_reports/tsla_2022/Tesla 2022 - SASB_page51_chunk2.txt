In order to concentrate on the events that matter most, we have made great efforts to increase our focus on 
events of significant consequence. We continue to track and report on OSHA statistics for our U.S. -based sites, 
such as DART rates for more serious injuries/illnesses, but we are shifting our view to be more forward thinking 
and globally inclusive.People and Culture
