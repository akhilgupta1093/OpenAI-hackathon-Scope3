While our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we continue to open new factories, our goal is to reduce the emissions intensity from production as we push the 
boundaries of sustainable manufacturing and improve the efficiency of our operations. As part of our 
commitment to reducing our overall emissions in the long term we signed up for the Science -Based Target 
Initiative (SBTi) in 2021.GHG Emissions
