While most heavy trucking journeys are shorter than 500 miles, we want long -distance hauling to also be 
sustainable. We are in the process of developing a Semi charger network at trucking rest stops across the U.S. 
and Europe, where each T esla Semi could top up their range.Tesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s 
transition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is 
the limiting factor for production –a Tesla Semi requires 
multiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle.
