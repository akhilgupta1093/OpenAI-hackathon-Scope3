Substantial coverage and 99.96% reliability
We’re aware that the chart showing Supercharger uptime looks silly, but that’s kind of the point. While coverage 
is important, uptime is essential. Few things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near -
empty battery, realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021 alone, we opened 912 new 
Supercharger locations around the world for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations with over 31,000 plugs.
