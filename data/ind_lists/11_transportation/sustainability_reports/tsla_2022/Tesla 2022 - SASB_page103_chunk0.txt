#2 Risk Identification2.3 GHG emissions hotspot identification
In addition to the product -specific LCA described in the Environmental Impact section, Tesla also commissioned 
LCA service provider Minviro to identify hotspots with high global warming potential across eight specific 
processing routes from which we currently source cobalt, nickel and lithium. 
The hotspot analysis found that main drivers of GHG emissions depend on the different battery compositions, 
processing routes and countries of origin. Overall, key drivers are the cathode and anode supply chains. Within 
the cathode supply chain, the hotspots are nickel and lithium, and cobalt was only a minimal contributor. Within 
the cobalt, nickel and lithium supply chains, chemical processing (refining / smelting) was a larger driver than mining.
