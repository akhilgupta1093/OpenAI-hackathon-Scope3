Texas Winter Storm
In February 2021, Texas experienced a weather event that caused the widespread loss of power for several days 
affecting thousands of residents. Tesla provided a disaster relief system to Pathways Youth & Family Services, 
Inc., a non- profit social service organization providing foster care, adoption and behavioral health services to 
communities across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile Powerwall units (for a total of ~100kWh of batteries and 40kW of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power to its facilities, 
enabling it to resume housing and other social services to children.
