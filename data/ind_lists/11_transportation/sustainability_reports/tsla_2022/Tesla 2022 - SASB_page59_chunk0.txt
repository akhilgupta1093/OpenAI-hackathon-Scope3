To put this in perspective, average GHG emissions from charging one New York -based Tesla vehicle equates to 
the emissions from an ICE vehicle with a fuel economy of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even 
when charging a T esla in Michigan, where approximately 60% of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the 
emissions from our vehicles still equates to the emissions from an ICE vehicle with 52 real -world MPG 
(considerably more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable energy solutions to generate power, emissions related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even further
