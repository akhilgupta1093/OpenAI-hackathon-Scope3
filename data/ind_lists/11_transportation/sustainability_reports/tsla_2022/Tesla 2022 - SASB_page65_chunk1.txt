4.  Transitioning to in -house manufactured 4680 T esla cells, whose production process can reduce energy 
consumption by more than 70%
At Tesla’s 2020 Battery Day, we presented a novel way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode 
process. Current electrode production processes involve mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders and using massive machinery to coat and dry the electrode. Since this process involves large ovens, today’s cell 
production consumes a lot of energy. The new dry -electrode process allows for the direct transition from a 
cathode or anode powder to an electrode film, reducing energy consumption in the overall cell manufacturing 
phase by more than 70% based on our latest analysis
