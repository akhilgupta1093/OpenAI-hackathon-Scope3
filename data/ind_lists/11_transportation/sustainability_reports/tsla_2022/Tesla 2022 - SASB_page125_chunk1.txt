Tesla’s Sustainability Council refined the list of 40 key issues into a survey containing 25 questions in an effort 
to help us prioritize these topics for operational management and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As part of the assessment, we surveyed our key stakeholders, asking them to rate the identified economic and ESG 
topics on a scale of 1 -5, based on their perceived importance and impact to Tesla’s business. A total of 2,168 
individuals from Tesla and approximately 40 external partners, including trade associations, universities, 
suppliers, environmental consultants, nonprofits and local administrators, responded to the survey. 35% of 
responses came from North America, 57% from China and 8% from Europe. Below are the top issues identified 
by our materiality analysis, in order of importance to survey responders.Appendix
