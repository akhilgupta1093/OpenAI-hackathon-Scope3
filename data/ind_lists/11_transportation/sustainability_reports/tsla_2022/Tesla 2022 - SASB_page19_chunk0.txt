20We have a zero -tolerance policy when it comes to child or forced labor and human trafficking by our suppliers
At T esla, we are committed to ensuring that the way we conduct our business and dealings with our suppliers 
reflects our values and our belief that everyone should be treated with dignity and respect. Tesla is committed 
to ensuring that our suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking. Modern slavery, 
child labor and human trafficking are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world, but 
unfortunately continue to exist all over the globe. Our commitment on this front is summarized in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct as well as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible Materials Policy , and we continue to 
work to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles in these statements. We look to the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development ( OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines to inform our process and use 
feedback from our internal and external stakeholders to find ways to continually improve it
