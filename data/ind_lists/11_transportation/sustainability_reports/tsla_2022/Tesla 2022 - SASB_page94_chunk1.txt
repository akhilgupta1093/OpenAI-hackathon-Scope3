In line with our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, Tesla is committed to ensuring 
that companies in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment. Our goal is that where 
Tesla’s supply chain touches, local conditions for stakeholders continuously improve as a result of our 
purchases. Our responsible sourcing strategy has the following objectives:
1.Increase the share of materials we source directly from suppliers, and those closer to our factories 
(supply chain localization); and  
2.Continue to source globally, to contribute to the improvement of local conditions in our sourcing communities. 
Mapping GHG emissions in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities
Upstream GHG emissions from manufacturing an EV battery –from raw material extraction through refining and 
transportation of materials –can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities cause up to ~80% of 
the total emissions of a Model 3 battery pack, with the largest contributors at the chemical processing stage. 
Our battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot analysis –an industry first –is on page 104 of this report.Supply Chain
