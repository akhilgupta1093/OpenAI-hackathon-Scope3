Diversity, Equity & InclusionTeslaâ€™s diversity data (EEO -1) vs. U.S. automotive companies
The diversity gap is even more pronounced when compared to automotive manufacturers. In nearly every job 
category, our employee base is more racially diverse than the automotive industry average. This is partially a 
function of the location of our factories. That said, our journey towards diversity, equity and inclusion is not 
finished and we continue to develop programs to make sure our employee base reflects the diversity of our 
country's population
