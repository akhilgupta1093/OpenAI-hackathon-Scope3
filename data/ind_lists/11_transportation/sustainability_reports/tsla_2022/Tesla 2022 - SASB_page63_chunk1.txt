In our quest for constant improvement, we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the 
previous one. For example, at Gigafactory Texas, we chose highly efficient, insulated, low emissivity windows to 
reduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery from our compressors alone will 
offset over 1 MW of natural gas consumption for process heating. While we have already completed substantial 
improvements at Gigafactory Shanghai, further improvements will continue at Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg 
and Gigafactory T exas.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further
