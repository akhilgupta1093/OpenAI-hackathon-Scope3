Many ESG ratings evaluate: “Does this ESG issue impact the 
profitability of the company?” We need a system that 
evaluates: “Does the growth of this company have a 
positive impact on the world?”
This evolution of ESG needs to be championed by 
institutional investors, rating agencies, public companies 
and the general public. As the world needs to strive for a substantial positive impact, we won’t be referring to ESG in 
this report. Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.
