Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct when identifying risks within 
our supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing 
practices within our supply chain that are contradictory to our policies. Our responsible sourcing policies require suppliers to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies. Furthermore, 
we continue to leverage our membership with the RBA to identify upcoming supply chain risks as well as 
understand industry best practices to address them. We are actively involved with the RMI as well as specific 
action groups within the organization. In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk 
analysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA -Online to collect information on corporate 
and factory -specific supplier performance.Responsible Sourcing
