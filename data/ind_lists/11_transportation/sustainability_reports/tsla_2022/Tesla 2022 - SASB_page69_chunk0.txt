70Pollution from burning fossil fuels leads to eight million premature deaths globally each year 
According to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University, in collaboration with 
the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, air pollution causes 
over eight million premature deaths annually. That is double the previous estimate of deaths from the negative 
effects of fine -particle pollution and would account for one -in-five premature deaths worldwide. This is a major 
advantage of EVs that is often forgotten about as the overall EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse gases. 
EVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very much about addressing preventable deaths today
