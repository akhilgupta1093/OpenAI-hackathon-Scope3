2.Potential environmental and social impact and scrutiny: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’ –in that 
they are raw materials that are produced through different methods of mining around the world, often 
concentrated in countries that face socio -economic and environmental challenges. As known global reserves 
are depleted, these minerals are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look to access resources in 
more remote and challenging locations to meet global demand. Cobalt, lithium and nickel are also classified 
as critical minerals by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments because they are essential in enabling a transition away from fossil fuels to a low -carbon economy. As a result, the impact of 
mining activity on the environment and local communities lends itself to greater environmental and social 
scrutiny from civil society, policymakers and investors
