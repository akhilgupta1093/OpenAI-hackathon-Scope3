Introduction What Do We See As Impact?
The biggest environmental impact is achieved through early displacement of ICE vehicles and replacing them 
with EVs. Additionally, we want to displace fossil- based energy generation with renewable energy generation. 
As of the end of 2021, Tesla (including SolarCity prior to its 2016 acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0 
Gigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over 25.0 Terawatt -hours ( TWhs ) of emissions- free 
electricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used 
to run all our factories since we began producing Model S in 2012 and electricity used to power all of our 
vehicles in that same period combined
