When the media reports a story about a vehicle fire, it is usually reporting on an EV fire. This is likely a result of 
chasing clicks, rather than the prevalence of EV -related fires compared to ICE vehicle- related fires. The reality is, 
when compared to Tesla vehicles, ICE vehicles catch fire at a vastly higher rate. According to the latest available 
data, in 2020, there were almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone.  
From 2012 to 2021, there has been approximately five Tesla vehicle fires for every billion miles traveled. By 
comparison, data from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation 
show that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle fires for every billion miles travelled.  
In order to provide an apt comparison to NFPA data, Teslaâ€™s data set includes instances of vehicle fires caused 
by structure fires, arson and other reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for some of the T esla vehicle 
fires over this time period
