86Tesla strives to go beyond industry standard testing by using real- world data from our fleet of over two millions 
cars on the road. Historically, the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles to perform well for a 
suite of regulatory and consumer tests. There are too many common impact scenarios (visible in the heatmap 
below) that are simply not covered by regulatory crash tests. The richness of data we are collecting enables us 
to develop safety in allscenarios, not only the ones covered by regulation and ratings. 
Algorithm, Trained By Fleet, Triggers Optimal Safety Responses
We analyze data from our fleet to find solutions, which we then update via over -the-air software updates. Our 
algorithm uses vehicle sensor data and, within tens of milli- seconds of impact, determines what type of impact 
has occurred and triggers the seatbelt pretensioners and airbags to respond in the most optimal way down to 
the millimeter and mile per hour. Tesla engineers are also in the final stages of evaluating a system which uses 
Autopilot to identify when a crash is imminent. This gives Tesla vehicles an uncanny ability to predict potential collisions and respond faster to an impact when it does occur.Vehicle Safety
