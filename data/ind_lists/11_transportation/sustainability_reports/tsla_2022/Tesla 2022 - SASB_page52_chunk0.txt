Safety –MetricsHow we measure success globally — prevention of serious injuries and fatalities
We transitioned to the ASTM standard E2920 -19 as our global metric in 2020 to better reflect our global 
presence and have an increased focus on serious injuries and illnesses. Other automakers have not yet adopted 
this standard, so we are benchmarking against other manufacturing and service industries. We made this 
change in response to studies indicating the statistical invalidity of previous metrics (Total Recordable Injury 
Rate [TRIR]) as measures of safety outcomes
