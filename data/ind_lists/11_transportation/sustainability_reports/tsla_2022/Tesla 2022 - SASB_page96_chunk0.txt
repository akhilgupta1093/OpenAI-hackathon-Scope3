While Tesla works with third -party recyclers, we also recycle in -house
In 2020, Tesla successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada for in -
house processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end -of-life batteries. While Tesla has worked for 
years with third -party battery recyclers to ensure our batteries do not end up in a landfill, we understand the 
importance of also building recycling capacity in -house to supplement these relationships. On -site recycling 
brings us one step closer to closing the loop on materials generation, allowing for raw material transfer straight 
to our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation for battery recycling at scale, 
allowing Tesla to rapidly improve current designs through operational learnings and to perform process testing 
of R&D products. By the end of 2021, this facility achieved a production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material 
per week
