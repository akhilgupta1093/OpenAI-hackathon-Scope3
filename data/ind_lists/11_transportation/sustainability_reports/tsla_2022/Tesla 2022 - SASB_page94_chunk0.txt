What do we see as impact?
Protecting human rights and the environment is core to our procurement strategy. T esla creates our products 
from many different materials and components, some of which we purchase from our direct (Tier 1) suppliers. 
Many of our Tier 1 suppliers do not purchase all their raw materials directly, rather they get them from their 
suppliers and sub -suppliers around the world through a complex supply chain. Though we believe that battery 
recycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion of these materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, 
we recognize that global battery cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to 
meet the growing demand for our products
