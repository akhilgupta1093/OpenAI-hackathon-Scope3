Building on this hotspot analysis and pilot project, Tesla developed a data collection methodology aligned with 
the GHG Protocol –a globally recognized standard for measuring GHG emissions –and informed by the 
European Product Environmental Footprint methodology and the Product Environmental Footprint Category 
Rules (PEFCR) guidance for batteries —a set of rules developed by the European Union on calculating product -
specific environmental footprint. Instead of relying on estimates or aggregate data from third parties, Tesla’s 
ambition is to collect as much primary data from Tesla’s suppliers as possible to get the most accurate 
understanding of GHG emissions hotspots and therefore, how to reduce emissions
