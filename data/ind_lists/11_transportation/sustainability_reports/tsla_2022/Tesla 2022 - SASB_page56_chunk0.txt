57Introduction In addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis (LCA) for Model 3 and Model Y, we are reporting total Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions and use -phase emissions of our vehicles
In this year’s report we are reporting our Scope 1 (direct emissions from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased electricity, heat, etc. for our facilities) emissions resulting from global operations. This information is not only 
important to benchmark our performance against other manufacturers but is also the first step to track 
progress as we continue to work to decarbonize our own operations. While the most important work we can do to reduce GHG emissions is through selling as many of our products as possible, we are also committed to 
reducing carbon emitted from our own operations longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also 
makes business sense as we reduce the resource intensity of our processes. 
It is possible to fully decarbonize the manufacturing and use of EVs –this is economically unfeasible for ICE 
vehicles
We are often asked if electric vehicles (EVs) are more sustainable than internal combustion engine (ICE) 
vehicles. The environmental impact of zero -emission transport and energy products, like the products that Tesla 
produces and sells, is undeniably more positive than the GHG -emitting alternatives. This becomes more 
pronounced when determining the lifetime impact of EVs versus ICE vehicles, which requires looking at the entire lifecycle —from raw materials to use -phase emissions to disposal —and not just at vehicle usage
