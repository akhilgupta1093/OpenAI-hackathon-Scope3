We are working to increase minority representation in professional and management categories through our 
intentional recruiting efforts with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions, 
activations at the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, AfroTec h , as well as 
community partnerships with organizations like College Track and Black Girls Code. We are also working to 
ensure that the diversity in our entry -level roles will, over time and because of internal movement, be reflected 
in our leadership roles
