We are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation. It is our goal to eventually 
have all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied through renewable sources where possible. Additionally, we 
are hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall to 
meet their own energy needs in a sustainable way
