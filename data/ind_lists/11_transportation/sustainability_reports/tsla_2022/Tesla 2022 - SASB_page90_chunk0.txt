Matching Energy Demand & SupplyCommercial scale customers: Megapack and renewables
The beauty of selling commercial storage systems such as Megapack is that purchasing such a product is almost 
purely a mathematical decision for our commercial customers. If installing Megapack makes economic sense, 
there is no reason not to install one. A single Megapack has on average 3,000 kWh worth of battery storage 
capacity, and given its scalability, enables projects over 1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be 
dependent on the global supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021, in order to meet demand that is well in excess of supply for energy storage products, Tesla began building a new production facility capable of 
producing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year
