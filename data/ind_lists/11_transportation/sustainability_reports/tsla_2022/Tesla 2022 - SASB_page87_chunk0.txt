88Safety starts with our clean sheet design
Improving occupant safety has always been key to our mission. All our vehicles are built off a safety -first 
architecture with a low center of gravity (thanks to the positioning of our battery) and enhanced frontal impact 
safety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in forward engine ICE vehicles)
