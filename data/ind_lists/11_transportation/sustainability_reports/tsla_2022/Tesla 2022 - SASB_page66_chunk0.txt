Standard Deviation RetentionOur batteries are designed to function for the entire life of the vehicle
Teslaâ€™s battery packs are designed to outlast the vehicle. We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after 
approximately 200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles in Europe. Creating a battery that 
could last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would dramatically reduce the emissions per mile driven 
for high -mileage vehicles such as taxis, delivery vans or trucks
