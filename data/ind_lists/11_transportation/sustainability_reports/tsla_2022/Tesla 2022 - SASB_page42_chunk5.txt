If any employee raises a good faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee concerns are 
investigated promptly and impartially in a manner appropriate to the circumstances. The Employee Relations 
team engages in feedback loops with leaders and HR to provide guidance on any appropriate follow -up actions, 
which range from additional communication and training to corrective action and discipline up to termination of 
employment.
