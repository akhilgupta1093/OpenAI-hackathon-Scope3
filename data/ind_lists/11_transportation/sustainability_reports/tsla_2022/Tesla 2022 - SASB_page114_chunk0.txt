115Across all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment of workers
The table below details findings of our audits across all suppliers regardless of severity and includes initial 
audits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100% of priority 
non-conformances, with the remaining open priority findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our 
initial focus on high -risk suppliers allowed us to cover more than 70% of this group in the first three years of the 
audit program and gave us an understanding of suppliers to prioritize in an expanded program.
