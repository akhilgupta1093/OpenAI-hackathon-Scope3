Tesla Robotaxis will be even more energy efficient
The energy efficiency of T esla vehicles will continue to improve as we improve our technology and powertrain 
efficiency. It is also reasonable to assume that our high -mileage products, such as our future T esla Robotaxis , 
will be designed for maximum energy efficiency as handling, acceleration and top speed become less relevant. 
This will minimize cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint per mile driven
