The most important variable in a lifecycle analysis of an automobile is real- world fuel consumption or electricity 
consumption, as applicable, which impacts the use -phase of the lifecycle. Various efficiency testing cycles such 
as NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real -world fuel or energy consumption. Therefore, we used: 
EV energy consumption: Real world energy consumption based on 25 billion miles traveled Tesla Model 3 and 
Model Y vehicles, including energy losses during the charging process. 
ICE fuel consumption: Data provided by Consumer Reports, which reports model year 2020 mid -size premium 
sedans achieve 24.3 MPG on average. This translates to over 400 grams of CO 2e per mile once we account for 
emissions generated through the extraction, refining and shipment of oil
