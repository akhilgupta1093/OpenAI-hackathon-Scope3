Safety Assist RatingsNot all Active Safety systems are created equal
Many people assume that AEB (Automatic Emergency Breaking) –a system that most new vehicles are 
equipped with –works equally well with all vehicles. That’s not the case. The range of sensors, compute power 
and quality of software in the system can vary dramatically. Our active safety features are powered by eight 
cameras, a neural -net computer and learnings from our fleet of over two million cars. 
After the introduction of Tesla Vision (a vision -only system that excludes radar), our active safety ratings with 
IIHS improved. Pedestrian AEB performance of our Tesla Vision was over 45% better than performance of vision 
+ radar. It is no surprise that the active safety score achieved by Tesla Model 3 Euro NCAP remains an outlier
