We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human 
Rights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We 
are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain â€”including with respect to our 
employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We require that our 
suppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers
