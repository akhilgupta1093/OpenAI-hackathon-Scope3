78Over 5 years of average driving, the ownership costs of a Tesla Model 3 are closer to a Camry than a 3 Series
The accessibility of our products is fundamental to our mission. While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to 
an equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be 
considered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower than those of ICE vehicles due to lower maintenance 
costs, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained exceptionally strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model 3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series, but the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s best -selling sedan, the Toyota Camry*
