126In 2021, we conducted a comprehensive materiality analysis to better understand the key ESG topics that were 
most salient to our diverse group of stakeholders. To start, we identified over 40 issues in key areas that could 
directly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic, environmental, social and 
governance issues. These issues were identified from four components: (1) a competitive landscape review, (2) 
interviews with investors and other key external stakeholders, (3) industry reports and documented research, 
such as the World Economic Forumâ€™s 2021 Global Risks Report and (4) external ESG frameworks relevant to our 
industry and regulatory requirements across global capital markets
