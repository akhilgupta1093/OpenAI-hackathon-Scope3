We also have a whistleblower hotline through which employees can report concerns at any time. T esla keeps 
information reported by employees in confidence, whether through the hotline or another channel. Our policies 
prohibit retaliatory actions against employees for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed to 
maintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees to raise concerns 
about policy violations by their manager or colleagues or about the workplace overall.
