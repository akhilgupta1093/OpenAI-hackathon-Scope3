2.5 Visits to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Argentina
A Tesla delegation including members of Tesla’s Responsible Sourcing Committee visited suppliers in the DRC 
and Argentina. Both trips included visits to mine sites and meetings with community representatives. In the 
DRC, Tesla also visited a school, an orphanage and a maternity clinic. Aside from contributing to Tesla’s 
environmental and social risk assessments, the trips helped Tesla better understand local contexts and 
challenges. The DRC trip provided a more nuanced view of the complex issue of artisanal and small- scale 
mining (ASM) and its history within the DRC. In Argentina, the trip focused on questions related to water usage 
and the use of new technologies to extract lithium in a more energy -efficient way
