Furthermore, we defined a separate category called Zero T olerance Violations, which, for example, include any 
violations related to the use of forced or child labor and inhumane treatment of workers. In cases where such 
instances are discovered, our supply chain leadership will be informed, and a corrective action plan will be 
developed immediately, together with the supplier. Tesla will transition away from the supplier relationship if the 
supplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified issues and improve their operations within a reasonable time frame.Responsible Sourcing
