99Prioritization of cobalt, lithium and nickel
Given their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage, Tesla has a dedicated responsible 
sourcing program for three priority minerals in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize 
these raw materials for the following reasons:
1.Commercial importance: Cobalt, lithium and nickel are the key raw materials used in cathode production, 
represent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving vehicle 
range and safety performance
