Board of Directors oversight
The Board of Directors serves as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and oversees the management of Tesla’s 
business —including reviewing the effectiveness of Tesla’s Impact priorities, initiatives and programs and this 
report. With those responsibilities in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla and its employees, officers and directors; and we periodically add new, highly qualified independent directors to the Board, such as Larry 
Ellison and Kathleen Wilson -Thompson in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the 
importance of sound corporate governance.
