The carbon impact of ICE vehicles remains the same every year of use, but for EVs, it should improve every year
Based on publicly available sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly 
less than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years before it is scrapped. Furthermore, as an ICE vehicle ages, its 
fuel efficiency only remains stable if serviced properly. On the other hand, electricity generation to charge EVs 
has become “greener” over time with the addition of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below, we show zero -
emission electricity generation capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without factoring in any 
changes to federal policy or an acceleration of the adoption of renewables in the U.S. (which is likely), if current 
trends remain stable, emissions generated through EV charging should continue to decline over time
