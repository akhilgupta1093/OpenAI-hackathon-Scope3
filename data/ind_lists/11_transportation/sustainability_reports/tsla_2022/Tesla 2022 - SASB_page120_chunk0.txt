Battery RecyclingTesla is building capacity to recycle manufacturing scrap and end of life batteries in order to close the loop on 
battery raw materials. By the end of 2021, our battery recycling facility at Gigafactory Nevada achieved a 
production rate of over 50 tons of recycled material per week.96 -97
Alignment with Best PracticesOur responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral Supply 
Chains. This means Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into 
on-the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report.98
Battery Supply ChainWe have prioritized responsible sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to EVs and energy storage. To ensure we are appropriately managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain, 
conduct in third -party audits and on -the-ground engagements, and collaborate with industry initiatives to ensure 
our suppliers are living up to our strict standards. 99 -111
