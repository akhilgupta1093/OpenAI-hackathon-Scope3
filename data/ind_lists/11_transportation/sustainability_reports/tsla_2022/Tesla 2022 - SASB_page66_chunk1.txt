Producing Robotaxis is a core part of our mission. All vehicles in the world combined travel trillions of miles 
every year. A relatively small number of vehicles, such as taxis, delivery vans, trucks and buses account for a 
disproportionate amount of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate amount of emissions. A single future Tesla vehicle with a million -mile battery could be utilized over five -times more than an average vehicle in 
the U.S. After being fully optimized, and even once it is scrapped, a battery can still be recycled and its materials used in a brand -new battery.Reducing Carbon Footprint Even Further
Increasing Vehicle Utilization
Note: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor. Retention figures at lowe r mileages above likely 
reflect the impact of age while higher mileage values, which come from high -utilization vehicles, likely reflect less influence from battery age
