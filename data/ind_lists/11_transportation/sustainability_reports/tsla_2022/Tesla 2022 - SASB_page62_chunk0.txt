Improving Powertrain EfficiencyMore efficiency than a Prius, performance of a Porsche
Tesla vehicles are among the most efficient EVs built to date. In the early days of Model S production, we were 
able to achieve energy efficiency of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Model Y All- Wheel Drive (AWD) achieves 4.1 EPA miles 
/ kWh, which makes it the most efficient electric SUV produced to date. The gap between Tesla AWD vehicle 
efficiency continues to stand out compared to competitors in the same segment. While achieving the best -in-
class energy efficiency, our AWD models can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model Y) and 
reach a top speed of 145 mph (135 mph for Model Y). In isolation, high energy efficiency is already difficult to 
achieve, but getting both performance and efficiency is the tricky part
