In 2021, we re -doubled our efforts to educate employees and managers that any form of discrimination must be 
reported. While our goal is always prevention, reported complaints of discrimination and harassment are 
promptly investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination. New 
employees receive anti -harassment and discrimination training during orientation. A new employee guidebook 
was also rolled out which instructs employees to report all forms of misconduct without concern. 
As the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers per year, educating our workforce is a top 
priority and an ongoing process.
