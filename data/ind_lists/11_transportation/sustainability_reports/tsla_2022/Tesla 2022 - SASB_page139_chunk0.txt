140GHG Emissions Disclosure (cont.)
3.Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions are inclusive of carbon dioxide (CO2), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and industrial gases such as hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).  Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and nitrogen trifluoride 
(NF3) are not emitted by Tesla’s sites. These carbon dioxide equivalent emissions utilize 
Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5 – 100 year) unless a different 
Assessment Report is already embedded in the emission factor source. Carbon dioxide 
equivalent emissions are calculated by multiplying actual or estimated energy and fuel 
usage by the relevant emission factor taking into account the equivalent GWP. All 
emission factors are updated annually where applicable. Management Assertion
