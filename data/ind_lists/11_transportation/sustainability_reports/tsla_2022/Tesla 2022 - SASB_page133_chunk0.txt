Vehicle use- phase emissions, which represent 80 -90% of total automotive emissions 
(included in Scope 3 of ESG reporting), tend to be misreported due to the use of 
unrealistic assumptions or not reported at all. OEM sustainability reportsAnalysis of sustainability reports by auto OEMs shows unrealistic assumptions for both vehicle life and annual 
mileage. For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low 
as 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17 years in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken 
together, even before considering the impacts of using real -world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this 
leads to a drastic under -reporting of Scope 3 emissions
