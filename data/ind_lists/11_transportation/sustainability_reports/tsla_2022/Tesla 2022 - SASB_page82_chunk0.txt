83Our commitment to safety is why all Tesla vehicles built since October 2016 come with a suite of external 
cameras, additional sensors and onboard computing that enable advanced safety features like Automatic 
Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Forward and Side Collision Warning, Obstacle -Aware 
Acceleration, blind spot warnings and more —all of which continue to improve over time through software 
updates. We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond the norm:
Traffic Light & Stop Sign Warning
When a driver doesn’t notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s speed is too high. 
Thanks to our eight -camera system, each vehicle can recognize a traffic light that is specific to vehicle’s 
trajectory as well as a stop sign. A loud warning is triggered to alert the driver
