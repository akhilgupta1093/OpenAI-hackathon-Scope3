The small number of post -consumer batteries that we receive are primarily generated from our fleet of vehicles 
on the road, predominantly from taxi -like vehicles. Since we have only been producing Model S (our oldest 
model) for approximately ten years, and our energy storage products for even less time, it will likely be some time before we start receiving back vehicle batteries in larger volumes.Supply Chain
