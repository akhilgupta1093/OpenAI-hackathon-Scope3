We strive to be the best on every metric relevant to our mission to accelerate the worldâ€™s transition to 
sustainable energy. T o maximize our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes and the accessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million 
electric vehicles per year (compared to 0.94 million in 2021) and deploy 1,500 GWh of energy storage per year 
(compared to 4 GWh in 2021)
