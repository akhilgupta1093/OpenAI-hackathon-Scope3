2.Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff (1 
million square feet) to a central underground storage system within Gigafactory Texas. Rainwater will be 
recycled for use in the cooling of manufacturing equipment. In an average year, such systems should save an 
estimated 7.5 million gallons of potable city water. Additionally, as hot, humid outdoor air is conditioned, water 
condenses out of the air. Typically, this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory Texas, we reuse 
this condensate in our cooling towers and process water systems to offset incoming site water
