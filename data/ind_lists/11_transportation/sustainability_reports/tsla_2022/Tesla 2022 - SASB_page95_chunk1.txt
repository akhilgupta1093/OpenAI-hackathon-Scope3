Longer battery longevity is the most sustainable option
Battery pack life extension is the superior option to recycling for both environmental and business reasons. 
Before decommissioning and recycling a consumer battery pack, T esla does everything it can to extend the 
useful life of each pack, including sending out over -the-air software updates to Tesla vehicles to improve battery 
efficiency when our engineers find new ways to do so. In addition, any battery that is no longer meeting a 
customerâ€™s needs can be serviced at a Tesla Service Center
