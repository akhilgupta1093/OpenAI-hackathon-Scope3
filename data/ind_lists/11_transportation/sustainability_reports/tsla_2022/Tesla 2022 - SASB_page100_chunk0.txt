101Our diversified cathode strategy
Tesla’s batteries today contain a variety of different cathode chemistries, including nickel- cobalt -aluminum 
(NCA) and nickel -cobalt -manganese (NCM) for higher energy applications and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) for 
lower energy applications. Tesla will continue to advance a diversified cathode strategy for LFP, nickel- rich and 
manganese -rich cathodes to address various market segments for vehicle and energy storage products and 
provide future flexibility based on raw materials availability and pricing. To put this into context, lithium only 
accounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight. Additionally, iron phosphate battery packs contain no 
cobalt or nickel. 
While the relative cathode compositions and our overall demand of various minerals and battery -grade 
chemicals will continue to evolve, Tesla and the global battery supply chain will require significant quantities of 
responsibly produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals for the 
foreseeable future. While we recognize the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion of these 
materials to enable a closed loop supply chain, global cell production will continue to rely heavily on primary, mined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium term. The availability and affordability of these minerals and chemicals are key to advancing Tesla’s mission and accelerating the transition to sustainable 
energy. We will continue to collaborate with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility to 
enable the scale up of key battery minerals
