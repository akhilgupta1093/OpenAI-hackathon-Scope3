Water usage and power generation
While many recognize the impact that power generation has on GHG emissions, its impact on water 
consumption is less appreciated. Power generation is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., 
as water for thermoelectric power is used to generate electricity with steam -driven turbine generators andto 
cool power -producing equipment. This means that every kilowatt -hour (kWh) of clean solar energy produced 
not only lowers GHG emissions, but also lowers water consumption
