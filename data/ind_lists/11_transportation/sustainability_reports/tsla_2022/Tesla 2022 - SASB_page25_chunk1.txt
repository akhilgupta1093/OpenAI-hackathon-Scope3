Manufacturing Development Program
This is a two -year program where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at T esla as a production 
associate while continuing their education in automation and robotics at a local community college. Since its 
launch in 2017, we've hired 168 graduates into this program, with active programs at Gigafactory Nevada, 
Gigafactory New York and our Fremont Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development 
Program class with Del Valle High School to support Gigafactory Texas in fall 2021. 
Tool & Die Apprenticeship 
In partnership with local community colleges, Tesla offers a federal and state certified Tool & Die Apprenticeship 
program in the U.S. at the Fremont Factory, Gigafactory Nevada and T esla Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships 
blend on -the-job training by qualified mentors with classroom learning, providing a holistic approach to 
learning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding, machining, blueprint reading and other critical 
skills. Similar programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory Berlin where we collaborate with local 
vocational schools and train students via facilitated workshops, self -led modules and on -the-job exercises for a 
variety of roles.People and Culture
