Every Tesla battery factory will recycle batteries on -site
As the manufacturer of our in- house cell program, we are best positioned to recycle our products efficiently to 
maximize key battery material recovery. With the implementation of in -house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory 
Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory T exas, we expect substantial increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We 
intend to tailor recycling solutions to each location and thereby re -introduce valuable materials back into our 
manufacturing process. Our goal is to develop a safe recycling process with high recovery rates, low costs and 
low environmental impact. From an economic perspective, we expect to recognize significant savings over the 
long term as the costs associated with large -scale battery material recovery and recycling will be far lower than 
purchasing additional raw materials for cell manufacturing.Global annual amount of lithium -ion battery metals sent for

A closed -loop battery recycling process presents a 
compelling solution to move energy supply away from the 
fossil -fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more 
circular model of recycling end -of-life batteries for reuse over 
and over again.Supply Chain
