14Committees of the Board
The Board has four standing committees —the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Disclosure Controls Committee —which are each 
further described in the following pages. Each member of these committees qualifies as an independent 
director under the listing standards of NASDAQ. In addition, as part of our governance review and succession 
planning, the Board (led by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) evaluates our leadership structure to ensure that it remains the optimal structure for Tesla, reviews the composition, size and 
performance of the Board and its committees, evaluates individual directors and identifies and evaluates 
candidates for election or re -election to the Board. Committee charters were updated in 2021 to reflect the 
growing risks and opportunities around ESG
