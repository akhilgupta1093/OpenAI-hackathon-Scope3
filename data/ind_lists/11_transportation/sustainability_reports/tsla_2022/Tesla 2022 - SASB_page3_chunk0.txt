The Future is Electric
30,000 litres (~8,000 U.S. Gallons) of fuel burned per car
70 tons of CO2e released into the atmosphere
Burned fossil fuel is extremely difficult to decarbonize
as carbon capture is not economically viable today
70 MWh of electricity charged per car 
30 tons of CO2released, assuming current global grid mix
Production and lifetime use of EVs is possible to decarbonize 
using well -established technologies
Battery pack is recycled at the end- of-life and used
to build a brand- new battery pack, over and over again .Lifetime fuel consumption and use -phase GHG emissions
