Our DEI governance structure supports our business operations. Our Senior Director of People engages with our 
Board of Directors to ensure our DEI plans are in alignment with Tesla’s strategic objectives. We also integrate 
our talent management and learning and development into the DEI functional scope to ensure equitable talent, 
career and learning resources are accessible to all employees. The DEI Director reports directly to the Senior 
Director of People and has regular engagement with company executives across the company to ensure that DEI principles are embedded into our business. The DEI Director is responsible for all of Tesla’s talent
