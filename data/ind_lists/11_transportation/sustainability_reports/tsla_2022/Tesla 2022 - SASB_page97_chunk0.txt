98We have high expectations for our suppliers
Tesla is committed to ensuring that our suppliers operate responsibly. We do this by proactively identifying and 
addressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and 
Responsible Materials Policy outline Teslaâ€™s expectations for suppliers. 
We established a responsible sourcing program based on international best practices 
Our responsible sourcing program is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Mineral 
Supply Chains. Tesla collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into on -
the-ground actions and discloses the outcomes in our annual Impact Report
