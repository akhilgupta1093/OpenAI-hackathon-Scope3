EV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof and an energy 
storage solution, such as Powerwall, in their homes. This dramatically reduces the lifetime carbon footprint of an 
EV, even when accounting for the carbon footprint of both the solar panel/Solar Roof and Powerwall 
manufacturing and upstream supply chain.EV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile
