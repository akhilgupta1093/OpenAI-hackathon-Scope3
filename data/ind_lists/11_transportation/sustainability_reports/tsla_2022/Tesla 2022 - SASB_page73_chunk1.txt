The “cooling tower makeup” is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint 
operations. As water that cools machinery evaporates, it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling 
tower makeup could be offset entirely by non -potable sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some 
of the initiatives we are taking at Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and/or Gigafactory T exas in order to reduce 
water consumption per complete vehicle (including cells)
