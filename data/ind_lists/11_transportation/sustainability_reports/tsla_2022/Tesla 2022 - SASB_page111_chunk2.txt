In any case where any priority non- conformance (the most significant type) occurs, our audit procedures 
require that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow up to the original audit 
where the non -conformances were identified –allow suppliers to address all non -conformances in the earlier 
audits. Additional audits, rather than an immediate suspension of the business relationship, are preferred to 
improve working conditions and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies
