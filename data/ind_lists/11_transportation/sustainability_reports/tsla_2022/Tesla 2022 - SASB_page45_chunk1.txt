Kentucky Storms
After the Kentucky winter storms, we deployed two systems at a research and education center in Princeton, 
Kentucky in partnership with the Footprint Project. These systems helped power communications trailers and 
mobile offices for over 50 recovery workers. They are still deployed while the center is being rebuilt and we are 
exploring ways to turn the trailers and mobile offices into a training center for future recovery workers
