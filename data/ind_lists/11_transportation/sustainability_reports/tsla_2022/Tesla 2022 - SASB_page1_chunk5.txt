On the product front, companies should be required to use 
real-world data wherever remotely feasible and make it 
clear when estimates are provided instead of real -world 
figures. An example of this is vehicle “use -phase” 
emissions, accounting for the vast majority of lifecycle 
emissions. Automakers' estimates on lifetime vehicle mileage and lifetime fuel consumption vary dramatically 
and almost never reflect real -world data. Automakers often 
have access to this data, but they don’t disclose it
