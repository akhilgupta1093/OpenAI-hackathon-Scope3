Similarly, the compensation program for Tesla’s non -employee directors is designed to be consistent with our 
compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity -based compensation over cash in 
order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the 
long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our general employee population restricted 
stock units that will retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity -based 
compensation to our directors has been exclusively in the form of stock options, which have zero initial value 
and accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following their grant, through 
the applicable vesting dates and until such stock options are ultimately exercised and the underlying shares are 
sold. The remaining portion of our directors’ compensation has been comprised of cash retainer payments that 
are relatively modest compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election of each 
director. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution that all existing directors forego any automatic 
grants of annual stock option awards under our director compensation policy until July 2022 unless the Board determines otherwise. Corporate Governance
