Privacy from day one
Tesla’s Privacy Principles and commitments are illustrated throughout all our products. For Tesla vehicles, 
customer personal data is protected from the moment they take delivery, ensuring that by default the vehicle 
data generated when driving is not associated with the customer's account or vehicle identification number. 
Tesla also puts customers in the driver’s seat when it comes to data sharing by providing a dedicated in -vehicle 
menu to adjust preferences at any time
