The criteria on which suppliers are selected to undergo the Supplier Audit is based on an expanded risk 
assessment approach, looking at Tesla’s exposure to suppliers financially, as well as suppliers’ location. This 
criteria determines which suppliers are obligated to undergo an audit, but additional suppliers can be 
nominated by our commercial and supplier industrialization teams where they see value in doing so or the 
potential to further mitigate risk. With the expanded audit program scope, we are targeting to cover over 50% of our global spend with our direct supply base
