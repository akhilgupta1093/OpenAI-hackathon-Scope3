Variables often overlooked by other lifecycle studies:
•Using Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle T est Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel/energy consumption data (both of which overestimate fuel -economy and underestimate 
emissions) rather than real- world data
•Not considering the higher energy efficiency of T esla’s powertrains
•Assuming the average EV needs a battery replacement at some point in its life (it doesn’t)
•Not considering emissions generated through the oil refining and the transportation process
•Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing6,500 miles
The manufacturing process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results 
in slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid mix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions than an equivalent ICE after driving 6,500 miles
