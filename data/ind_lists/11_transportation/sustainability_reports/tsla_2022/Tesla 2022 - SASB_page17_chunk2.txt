Engaging the security community
We are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. T o do that, our team of 
world -class engineers works day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. 
And while some of the best security engineers work at Tesla, we believe that in order to design and build 
inherently secure systems, we cannot work alone. We work closely with the security research community to 
benefit from their collective expertise and diversity of thought
