87Changing How Vehicles Are Designed For Safety
We use field data, data analytics and simulations to inform our design and safety engineers’ work on future 
products and to send software improvements to our existing fleet via over -the-air updates. Tesla is also sharing 
data and statistics collected by our vehicles with select regulatory bodies and external research organizations —
in an anonymized fashion or with consent and in accordance with local data privacy laws — giving them access 
to an unprecedented opportunity to understand crashes in the real world. This access to data will accelerate 
impact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved safety outcomes for all vehicles 
to protect lives
