68We can make the biggest impact on GHG emissions by selling as many of our products as possible. 
Undoubtedly, the use -phase of our products avoids more lifetime emissions than either our operations or our 
supply chain could. However, in support of our mission, we track and try to minimize emissions that result from 
our full value chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well as our sales, service and 
delivery activities
