For cells containing NCA and NCM cathodes, we continue to work toward batteries that contain higher levels of 
nickel in order to improve vehicle range while lowering overall battery costs, without compromising overall cell 
performance, such as battery safety and lifetime, that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important to note that 
we expect our absolute cobalt demand to increase over the coming years because our vehicle and cell 
production growth rate is forecasted to outpace the overall rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.Battery Supply Chain
