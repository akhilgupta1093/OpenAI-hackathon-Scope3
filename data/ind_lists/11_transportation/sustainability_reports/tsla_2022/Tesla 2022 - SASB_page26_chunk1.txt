Internship program
Our internship program continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse entry level professional talent. In 
our effort to expand access to our program, we attended more than 75 diversity hiring events targeting women 
and students of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and launched new 
community Internship Initiatives with Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars in Nevada and 
College Track in the Bay Area to increase diversity in our program.

Latina representation at all levels of STEM corporate and academic leadership.People and Culture
