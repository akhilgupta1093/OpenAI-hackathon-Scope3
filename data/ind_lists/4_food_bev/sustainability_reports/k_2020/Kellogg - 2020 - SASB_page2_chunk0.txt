Social Impacts of 
Ingredient Supply 
Chain  Percentage of food ingredients sourced that are certified to third -party 
environmental and/or social standards, and percentages by standard  We have environmental and social requirements for 
purchasing all our major ingredients. For some, we source 
in accordance with internationally recognized standards 
such as RSPO and Fair Trade. However, as a grain -based 
company, those represent a very low percentage of our 
total volume of ingredients purchased. We continue to 
work with our suppliers to responsible source and 
sustainably grow our ingredients.
