Since food waste and loss occur from 
"farm-to-fork” and impact growers, 
families, communities, the environment 
and businesses, we engage with a 
wide variety of partners to advance 
positive change. We bring a systems 
lens and take a collective impact 
approach to the issue, working 
with cross-sector coalitions and 
nonprofit organizations around the 
globe. Our focus areas include:
n   Expanding global knowledge 
and insights about the most 
scalable, high-impact solutions 
to food waste and loss
n   Strengthening the capacity, safety and 
efficiency of food banks worldwide
n   Catalyzing innovative new surplus 
food recovery solutions
Our latest philanthropic support for 
ReFED — a leading U.S. nonprofit that 
works with businesses, government 
leaders, environmental organizations, 
community nonprofits, researchers, investors and others to advance food 
waste solutions — helped bring about 
the ReFED Insights Engine as part of 
the organization’s Roadmap to 2030 . 
A first-of-its-kind solution, the Insights 
Engine is an interactive online platform 
that enables any user from any sector 
to dynamically explore the food 
waste issue and model the projected 
impacts (climate, economic, social, 
etc.) of various solutions (see above). 
In addition to supporting broader food 
system solutions, we also donate surplus 
food from our own operations to enable 
meals for food-insecure people.Enabling food recovery
