Over the years, we have made significant 
progress reformulating products by 
increasing positive nutrients, like whole 
grain, fiber and iron, and reducing 
limiters, like sodium and sugar. From 
fiscal 2005 to 2018, we tracked and 
shared our progress through our U.S. 
Health Metric reporting system, whereby 
we improved the nutrition of our U.S. 
retail sales volume by 81% primarily by increasing positive nutrients or 
decreasing nutrients to limit. In fiscal 
2019, we updated and expanded 
our approach to a new global health 
reporting system that provides a 
transparent snapshot of the nutritional 
characteristics of our global portfolio. 
The process for determining which 
products qualify as Nutrition-Forward 
Foods is based on established nutrition 
criteria grounded in regulations, dietary 
guidance and nutrient density.Results: In fiscal 2021, 41% of General 
Mills global volume met our Nutrition-
Forward criteria, including 22% that met 
the criteria by providing a meaningful 
amount of a food group and 19% that met 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s 
Healthy criteria through limits on sodium 
and saturated fat. Our expansive and 
diverse portfolio offers a delicious variety 
of nutrient-dense products from every 
food group to help support consumers 
in building healthy eating patterns
