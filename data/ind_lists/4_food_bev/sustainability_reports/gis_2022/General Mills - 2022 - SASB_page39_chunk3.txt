When issues arise in audits or through 
media alerts, the responsible sourcing 
team elevates them for visibility and 
provides regional sourcing leadership 
with recommendations to close the 
finding. If needed, visibility is brought 
to the regional supply chain leader for 
resolution. Regular progress review is 
conducted until the issue is resolved
