Collaboration: We directly control 
only a small portion of our value chain, 
so driving transformation across the 
entire system requires leadership and 
collaboration with suppliers, farmers, 
ingredient and packaging producers, 
product transport providers, retailers and 
consumers. Combating climate change 
also requires collective action across 
industries and our broader society. We 
participate in the following initiatives:
n   Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
n   Business Ambition for 1.5°Cn   We Mean Business
n   We Are All In pledge
n   UN Caring for Climate Declaration
n   Business for Nature’s Call to Action
n   Climate Collaborative
n   Project Drawdown
Science-based goal: General Mills was 
the first company to publish a full value 
chain goal approved by the SBTi, in 
2015. During 2020, we launched a new 
climate goal to drive further progress, in 
alignment with the SBTi 1.5°C guidance
