General Mills works to reduce the 
environmental impact of packaging 
by increasing use of recycled and 
recyclable materials, innovating 
to make our materials better, and 
leading through external collaboration. 
We are focused on protecting the 
attributes of the food while giving 
consumers a positive experience 
with our packaging, from shelf to 
bin. Given the many different types of 
packaging in our products, innovation in this space requires significant 
time, investment and collaboration. 
Ambition: Our packaging ambition is 
that all General Mills brands will design 
100% of packaging to be recyclable or 
reusable by 2030
