In June 2017, General Mills signed a 15-year 
virtual power purchase agreement with 
Renewable Energy Systems (RES) for 100 
megawatts of the Cactus Flats wind project 
in Concho County, Texas. In fiscal 2021, 
this project generated RECs equivalent to 
approximately 1,205,596 GJ of electricity 
for General Mills, about 33% of electricity usage at our owned manufacturing locations 
in the U.S. In April 2019, we announced a 
15-year virtual power purchase agreement 
with Roaring Fork Wind, LLC, a joint venture 
partnership between RES and Steelhead 
Americas, for 200 megawatts of its Maverick 
Creek wind project. Located in central Texas, 
the project will produce RECs for General 
Mills that, together with the Cactus Flats 
wind power agreement, are calculated to 
equal 100% of the electricity used annually 
at the companyâ€™s owned U.S. facilities. 
The Maverick Creek wind project began 
commercial generation in November 2020.Renewable electricity
