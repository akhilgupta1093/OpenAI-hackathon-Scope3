We are working to address shared 
issues — such as health and nutrition, 
racial equity, climate change and 
water stewardship — so collaboration 
is essential to achieving long-term, 
enduring progress. We work with 
other companies and organizations to 
shape standards across the consumer 
packaged goods industry, which 
elevates overall sector performance.We engage on issues that are material 
to our global responsibility strategy 
and where we can have a substantial 
positive impact. When engaging with 
stakeholders, we assess potential 
alignment on objectives, organizational 
expertise, capacity, influence and 
willingness to collaborate
