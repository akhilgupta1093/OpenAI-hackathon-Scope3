n   Workplace health and safety is the 
responsibility of line management 
and each individual employee. 
All employees are expected to 
work safely by following policies, 
procedures and training. Leaders 
are accountable for understanding 
and removing barriers to safe work 
that may be system related.New safety metrics enable focus on  
critical risks:
PREVIOUS SAFETY METRICS
Based on U.S. OSHA TIR*
Reasons for the change:
n   Previous criteria and metrics were  
not aligned with our current incident 
prevention strategy. 
n    Metrics were adding increased cost/risk  
and compromising our safety culture. 
n   New metrics and data were required  
to evolve in safety. NEW SAFETY METRICS
Based on ASTM E2920 principles
Benefits:
n   More globally relevant and aligned  
with our strategy.   
n   Regions continue to report injuries  
and illnesses per their local  
regulatory requirements.  
n    Enables integration of other 
complementary safety metrics within 
General Mills to advance serious injury 
and fatality (SIF) prevention.
