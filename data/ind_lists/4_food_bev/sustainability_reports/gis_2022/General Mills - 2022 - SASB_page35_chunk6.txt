Preliminary research suggests that almonds 
grown with regenerative agriculture 
principles result in powerful soil health and water benefits, including significantly 
higher water infiltration rates as well as 
potential reductions in irrigation needed. 
General Mills is taking a multipronged 
approach to advance understanding and 
adoption of regenerative agricultural 
practices for almonds: 
n   Supporting sustainable water 
regulation implementation and 
agricultural water efficiency 
n   Funding research focused on 
regenerative agriculture and water 
in California, with a specific focus on outcomes measurement and 
modeling for almonds grown 
using regenerative principles
n   Leading a working group with the 
California Water Action Collaborative 
to scope a regenerative agriculture 
pilot that aims to improve water 
resilience in the San Joaquin ValleyAdvancing regenerative agriculture in almonds
w To advance regenerative agriculture 
in almonds, LÃ¤rabar is funding research 
with the Ecdysis Foundation to 
determine how on-farm practices are 
linked to regenerative outcomes
