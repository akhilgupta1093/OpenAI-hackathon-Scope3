Our approach: We support our 
hometown communities around the 
world through local community giving 
and employee volunteerism. We 
encourage and empower our employees 
to apply their skills, expertise and passion 
to help strengthen their communities. 
We are proud of the 80+% employee 
volunteerism rate that General Mills  
has maintained in recent years.  During the COVID-19 pandemic,  
we have encouraged our employees to 
support their communities in modified 
ways that keep everyone safe and 
healthy, such as the food donation 
event we hosted at our headquarters, 
which enabled employees and their 
families to drive-up and donate foods 
and household items for area charities.Employee volunteerism and giving for community impact
