Strengthening hometown communities –  
making meaningful impact in 
the communities where our 
employees live and work.Targeted impact: To ensure General Mills 
philanthropy is well informed and effective, 
we use an outcomes-based approach 
to help strategically target and advance 
solutions in priority issue areas. Led by 
managers on our Global Impact Team and 
with input from other internal and external 
subject matter experts, we leverage the 
evidence base to develop logic models 
for each of our priority issue areas that 
clearly define: the end outcomes (social 
and environmental) we are targeting; 
the key activities and interventions that 
best support those outcomes; and the 
key measures we will use to assess our 
impact and progress along the way.Our approach

to regenerating 
forest ecosystems
General Mills’ philanthropic program 
in cocoa growing communities in 
West Africa aims to support long-term 
forest protection and restoration by 
improving overall farmer livelihoods. To 
ground our work in community needs 
and achieve longstanding impact, 
General Mills’ partner, PUR Projet, 
conducted two Farmer Livelihood 
Assessments during fiscal 2021 in Ghana 
and Côte d'Ivoire. This methodology 
provides a holistic vision of objectives, 
constraints and opportunities for 
the program’s participating farmers 
by embedding a systems approach 
in a series of interlocking activities. 
These assessments provided a 
clear framework for operating that 
is key to achieving success
