In partnership with Furman University, 
we built a model simulating the 
effects of regenerative agriculture 
on bird populations and biodiversity. 
The model compared the current 
landscape to scenarios with 25%, 
50% and 75% of cropland using 
regenerative agriculture practices in 
the Central Great Plains
