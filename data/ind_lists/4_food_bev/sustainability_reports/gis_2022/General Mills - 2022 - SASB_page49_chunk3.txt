Juneteenth Day of Action
On June 18, 2021, General Mills hosted 
our first Juneteenth Courageous 
Day of Action. Employees at our 
headquarters packed more than 
8,000 school supply kits for students. 
The event coincided with the first 
observance of Juneteenth as a U.S. 
federal holiday, commemorating the 
end of slavery. Learn more about this 
event and our efforts to advance 
equity in our communities in the 
Community section of this report. 
r CEO Jeff Harmening joined 
employees packing school supplies.r In August 2021 — one year after making 
public our commitment to racial equity —  
we came together virtually across the 
company for a Courageous Conversation to 
review our progress and challenge each other 
to do more. Watch this video to learn more
