sponsors, the facility was renovated with 
new bathrooms, windows, heating and 
air conditioning and electrical system, 
a refurbished kitchen, gymnasium, 
computer lab, reading lab and art rooms. r Prior to COVID-19, General Mills 
volunteers met regularly with kids

interviewing skills, help with school 
applications and other activities. During

virtual engagement with the kids and 
socially distanced, outdoor events.r As part of the renovation, employees
