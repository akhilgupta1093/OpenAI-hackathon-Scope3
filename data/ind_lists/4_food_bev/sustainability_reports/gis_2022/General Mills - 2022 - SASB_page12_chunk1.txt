Nutrient-dense foods — like fortified 
whole grain cereals, low-fat and nonfat 
yogurts, granola bars, and frozen fruits 
and vegetables — play an important 
role in healthy diets. They are important 
contributors to consumption of key 
food groups, including whole grain, 
dairy, fruits and vegetables, nuts and 
seeds, and beneficial nutrients, like 
vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber, while balancing nutrients to limit, such 
as sodium, sugar and saturated fat
