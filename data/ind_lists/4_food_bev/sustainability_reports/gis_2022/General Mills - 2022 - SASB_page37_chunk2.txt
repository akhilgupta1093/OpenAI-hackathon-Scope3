In fiscal 2021, we completed 35 energy 
efficiency and reduction projects across 
the company. In total, these projects 
saved 4.1 million kWh of electricity, 58 
thousand MMBTU of natural gas, and 
avoided 370,594 metric tons COâ‚‚e of 
GHG emissions. One example of these 
projects is a rooftop solar and battery 
system installed at our Sanhe, China, 
location, which is estimated to save 1.1 
million kWh of electricity annually. Sustainable operations

During 2020, General Mills set a goal to 
source 100% renewable electricity for our 
global operations* by 2030. We achieved 
63% of this target through fiscal 2021. We 
have implemented numerous renewable 
energy initiatives at facilities worldwide that 
meet financial guidelines and support our 
environmental objectives. Examples include 
anaerobic digestion (which captures and 
uses methane to generate electricity) and 
burning oat hulls and other biomass
