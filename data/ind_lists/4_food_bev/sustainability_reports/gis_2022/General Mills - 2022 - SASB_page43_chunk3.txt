Governance: Responsibility for our 
labor practices lies primarily within our 
Human Resources, Law and Supply 
Chain organizations. Our Chief Human 
Resources Officer oversees employee 
programs, policies and practices, and 
reports directly to the Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer. Reflecting the 
importance of people to our business, 
General Mills employs a Director 
of Diversity and Inclusion, a Vice 
President of Talent and Organization 
Capabilities, and a Director of Health, Safety and Environment. At the 
board level, the Public Responsibility 
Committee maintains responsibility 
for issues related to labor practices
