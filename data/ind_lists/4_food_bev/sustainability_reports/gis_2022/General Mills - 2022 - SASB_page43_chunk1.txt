At General Mills, it’s all about our people. 
The passion, conviction, commitment, 
care and resilience that our people bring 
to everything we do at General Mills are 
what make the difference. We’re proud 
of our efforts to create a safe, inclusive 
and rewarding workplace. We invest in 
our people because their bold thoughts 
and big hearts allow us to grow together. 
Our focus on people — including human 
rights and racial equity — extends across 
our value chain. 2021 was another year 
of change, with COVID-19, continued 
social inequalities, and our organization’s 
restructuring to prioritize growth-facing 
areas critical to the company’s success. 
These changes both reinforced and 
strengthened our resolve to put people 
first and make a positive impact in all 
our communities around the world
