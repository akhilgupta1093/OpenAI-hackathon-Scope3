Courageous Conversations: Now 
in its fifth year, our Courageous 
Conversations initiative brings together 
employees to have candid discussions 
in a safe and supportive setting about 
important issues affecting our work 
and our lives. The conversations are 
designed to build empathy, productive 
discourse and employee engagement. 
Inclusion contacts: Our library of 
inclusion contacts now has more 
than 300 topics. Generally used at 
the beginning of a meeting, these 
contacts create space for team 
members to share experiences and 
perspectives, foster discussion and 
educate and inform teams about events, 
celebrations and holidays in order to 
build empathy and understanding.Employee networks: Our employee 
networks help build a culture of belonging 
by bringing together colleagues for 
community building, networking, 
professional development and community 
outreach. Our employee networks include:
