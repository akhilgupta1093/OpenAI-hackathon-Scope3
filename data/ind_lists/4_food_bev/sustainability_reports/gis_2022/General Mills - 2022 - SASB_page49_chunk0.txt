Governance and leadership: We believe 
leadership advocacy and support of our 
inclusion efforts are critical to creating 
the culture we strive to have. Each of our 
senior leaders is responsible for creating 
inclusion plans for their respective 
organizations and ensuring their talent 
pipelines reflect the diversity of our 
talent pool. Our Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Human Resources Officer 
review inclusion progress throughout the 
year, including during our senior-level 
talent reviews. Our management team 
also supports our inclusion efforts as 
sponsors of our employee networks
