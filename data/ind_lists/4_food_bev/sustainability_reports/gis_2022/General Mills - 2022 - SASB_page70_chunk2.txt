Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions occurring  from assets not owned or controlled by the 
reporting  organization, but t hat the organizatio n indirectly impacts in its valu e chain. Scope 3 
emissio ns include  all sources not within an organizationâ€™s scope 1 and  2 boundar y, as outlined 
by the GHG Protoco l. General  Mills uses operat ional control to categorize those emissio ns 
within its org anizat ional boundary. 
Cons istent with SBTi guidelines, our targets focu s on the categories of  GHG emissions that 
are the most impactful and actionable for Ge neral M ills, a nd exclude e missions such as low-
volume  ingredients, capital goods, employee comm uting, franchises, downstream warehouse 
and storage at retail, consum er trips to store and end of life (cons umer food waste)
