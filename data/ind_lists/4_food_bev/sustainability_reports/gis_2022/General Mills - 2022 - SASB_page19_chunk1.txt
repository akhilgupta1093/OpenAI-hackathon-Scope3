We continue to increase transparency 
by providing information to key stakeholders when and where they need it. For example, to help consumers learn more about what is in their food, we provide information in multiple ways — on packages, through our company and brand websites, on our brands’ social media channels and on third-party sites, such as e-commerce and transparency platforms. In addition, we actively support public policy efforts to  
inform consumers and increase their a
wareness about our products — these  
efforts are detailed in the Introduction   
section of this report
