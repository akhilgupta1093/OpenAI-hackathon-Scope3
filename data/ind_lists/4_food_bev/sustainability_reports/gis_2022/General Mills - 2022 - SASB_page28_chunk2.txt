Since 2019, General Mills has provided 
philanthropic support to PUR Projet to 
drive long-term forest protection and 
restoration by improving cocoa farmer 
livelihoods. Through work with smallholder 
farmers, PUR Projet has identified the 
urgent need to restore forest cover and 
strengthen economic resilience in key 
General Mills cocoa sourcing regions 
in West Africa, including Mont Peko 
buffer communities in Cote d’Ivoire 
and Kakum National Park in Ghana. With a goal of addressing deforestation in 
these regions, our PUR Projet partnership 
supports ecosystem restoration by engaging 
local communities through the introduction 
of diversified agroforestry and tree 
nurseries, while simultaneously launching 
complementary community-based activities 
that support the long-term success of tree 
planting initiatives, carbon sequestration, 
and ecosystem service-oriented activities 
through community empowerment and 
income diversification and generation.Combatting deforestation through farmer resilience
