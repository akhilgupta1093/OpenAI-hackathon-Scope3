Our progress: General Mills has a history 
of strong safety performance and 
culture. In fiscal 2021, we took bold steps 
forward by implementing new injury and illness reporting criteria and metrics to 
improve our safety culture and focus 
more intently on eliminating incidents 
and situations with the greatest potential 
to significantly harm our people. The 
decision to change our reporting criteria 
and metrics was informed by current 
best practices for preventing serious 
injuries and fatalities (SIF), including 
insights from The Campbell Institute
