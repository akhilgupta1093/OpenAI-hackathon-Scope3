Fortification: We fortify key products 
in line with public health principles 
including using evidence-based 
decision-making to help guide the use 
of nutrients in our foods. General Mills 
periodically assesses population nutrient 
intakes using nationally representative 
dietary surveys to ensure our products 
help meet consumer dietary needs
