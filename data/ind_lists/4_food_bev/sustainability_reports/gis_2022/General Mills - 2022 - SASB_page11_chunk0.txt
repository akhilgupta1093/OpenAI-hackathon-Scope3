Our approach 
Our goal is to provide a diverse 
portfolio of products that contribute to 
the well-being of our consumers and 
meet a variety of their needs. We are 
committed to making food with passion 
and putting people first by improving 
the nutrient density, affordability, and 
accessibility of our products. At General 
Mills, we view nutrition as a source 
of growth and as a force for good. 
Our aspiration: We recognize the 
importance of our foods in consumers’ 
lives, and we provide a variety of 
foods that fit with our consumers’ 
budgets, time, tastes and nutritional 
needs. We understand the importance 
of sustainable food systems and the 
critical role the food industry can play 
in meeting these needs. We aspire to 
provide nutrient-dense foods that are 
made with ingredients grown using 
regenerative agricultural practices, 
that are affordable, easy to prepare 
and that the whole family loves.
