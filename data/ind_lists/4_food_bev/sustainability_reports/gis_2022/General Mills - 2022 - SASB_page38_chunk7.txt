A multifaceted approach to rescue food
We closely monitor and manage our 
production processes to keep surplus 
food out of the waste stream. Surplus 
food from our operations is first offered 
to food bank partners to feed hungry 
people; the remainder is repurposed for 
animal feed or anaerobic digestion. In fiscal 
2021, 0.5% of our total production volume 
was food waste. In addition, 11 facilities 
(28% of the global total) met our zero-
waste-to-landfill criteria in fiscal 2021
