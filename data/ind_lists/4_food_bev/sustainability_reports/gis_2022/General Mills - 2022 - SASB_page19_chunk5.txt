Sustainable sourcing: We are committed to sustainable sourcing of the ingredients used in our products and we regularly share information about our progress. For example, we disclose an updated list of all our palm oil suppliers down to the mill level to facilitate transparency and accountability in our extended supply chain. Details about our ingredients, how they are sourced and how we engage with farmers are included in the sustainable sourcing content in the Planet section of this report. 
Biotechnology: Safety is our highest 
priority, and we find broad global consensus among food and safety regulatory bodies that approved GMOs are safe. We agree with the UNâ€™s World Health Organization (WHO) that the development of GMOs offers the potential for increased agricultural productivity and improved nutritional value that can enhance human health and development. We have been disclosing the presence of bioengineered ingredients on our U.S. packages since 2016
