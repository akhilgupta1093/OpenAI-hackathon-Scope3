Chickens: General Mills will work to 
transition 100% of the broiler chickens 
we buy in the U.S. to meet a higher 
standard of animal welfare by 2024. Also 
by that year, we will work to ensure broiler 
chickens are processed using multistep 
controlled atmosphere stunning. By 2026 
we will only use breeds accepted by 
the Global Animal Partnership (G.A.P.) 
or the Royal Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals. Suppliers will be 
asked to demonstrate compliance through certification or third-party auditing. As 
qualifying breeds have only recently been 
determined by G.A.P., we anticipate that 
supply will remain limited in the near future. 
As we monitor industry developments, 
our near-term efforts will focus on 
advancing enrichments within the supply 
chain for our limited chicken purchases
