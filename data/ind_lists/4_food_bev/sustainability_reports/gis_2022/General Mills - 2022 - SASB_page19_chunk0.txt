Our approach: At General Mills, we are 
committed to increasing transparency about our food. We recognize that consumers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders seek information about our products and processes. Consumers want to know whatâ€™s in their food, where it comes from and how it is prepared. They also want assurance that food has been grown and harvested in a responsible and sustainable manner that respects people, animals and the environment
