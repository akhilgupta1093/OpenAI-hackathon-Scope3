**General Mills uses the market-based emissions methodology for Scope 2 emissions, which considers any contractual 
instrume nts that may b e used in competitive energy markets, such as green tariffs, renewable certificates, or PPAs. Both 
market-based and location-based emissions are reported in our CDP Climate disclosure..General Mills GHG emissions by scope

GHG calculation methodology
We work with Quantis to cal culate our global GHG emissi ons footprint each fiscal year, 
following  the guidelines of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Re porting  Standard . 
This footprint cove rs our complete value chain. For our 2030 science-based t arget, we define 
our emissions bound aries in alignment with the Sc ience -based  Targe t Initiative (SBTi):
Scope 1: Direct greenhouse (G HG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled 
or owne d by an organiz ation (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in bo ilers, 
furnaces, vehicles). Ge neral M ills uses operational contro l to categorize those emissions within 
its organizational boundary. 
Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions associate d with the purcha se of electricity, steam, heat, 
or cooling. Genera l Mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions  within its 
organizational b oundar y. 
General Mills uses the market-based metho dology for calculation of our Scope 2 emissions, 
which cons iders any contractual instruments that may be used  in competitive energy 
markets, such as green tariffs, renewa ble certifi cates , or PPAs
