In March 2017, we signed on to the World 
Cocoa Foundation’s Cocoa and Forests Initiative (CFI) to combat deforestation in 
key cocoa growing regions. Through this 
initiative we have worked closely with 
suppliers, stakeholders and Proforest 
to identify strategic actions to protect 
and restore forests, increase sustainable 
production, and promote social and 
community engagement. Additionally, we 
work with suppliers who plan to leverage 
full traceability to address deforestation 
risks within their supply chains. 
Our CFI action plans and progress 
to date for Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire 
can be viewed here . As we continue 
our work with CFI in our key cocoa 
sourcing regions in West Africa, we 
will leverage the knowledge we gain 
to inform approach and strategy to 
achieve deforestation-free cocoa for 
the rest of our sourcing origins. Eliminating deforestation
