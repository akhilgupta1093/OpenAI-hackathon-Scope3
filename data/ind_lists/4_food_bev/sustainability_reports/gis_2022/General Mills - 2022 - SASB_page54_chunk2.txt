To continue supporting employees’ 
well-being, we introduced two 
new programs in January 2021:
n   Spring Health – A confidential resource 
that provides mental health support 
services to employees and their 
families, including dedicated support 
from a care navigator, personalized 
care plans, therapy, meditation 
exercises, coaching to manage stress, 
medication management, substance 
use support and other services to 
help navigate life’s challenges.* 
n   Virgin Pulse – A behavior-change 
program that helps employees 
prioritize their well-being, including 
eating habits, sleep, physical activity, relationships and finances. 
The program makes it easy to 
track progress, connect, and 
compete with friends, family and 
coworkers to earn rewards.**
Benefits: Employee benefits vary by 
location. For example, for nonunion 
employees in the U.S. we offer:
n   Overall – Comprehensive medical and 
dental benefits to employees and 
eligible dependents. Employees are 
automatically enrolled in company-
paid benefits, including life insurance, 
business travel accident insurance 
and short- and long-term disability
