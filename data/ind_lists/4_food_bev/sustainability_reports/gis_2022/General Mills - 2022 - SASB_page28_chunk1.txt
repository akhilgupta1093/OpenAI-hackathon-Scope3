The remaining 1% is sourced from 
countries considered at high risk, 
particularly China. Weâ€™ve assessed 
suppliers in China to better understand certifications in use. Our fiber purchased 
from China is only sourced from 
suppliers that have Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC) Mix certification or 
better, which will be maintained.Looking ahead:  While we must focus 
on deforestation-free ingredient streams 
in the near term, this is nested in a 
larger strategy that works toward the 
acceleration of regenerative systems. 
Within tropical forests the regenerative 
approach brings focus to farmers, 
forests, and soil by looking at holistic 
systems to examine both planetary 
and community resilience within a 
particular landscape. This approach 
encourages mixed agroforestry, creating 
a polyculture and fostering biomimicry, 
leading to enhanced soil quality, better-
managed water retention, and increased 
carbon sequestration within the forest. The regenerative approach also 
encourages capacity-building activities 
within local communities to focus on 
smallholder training on forest practices, 
economic resilience, and social inclusion 
training to regenerate livelihoods.  
Due to the challenges posed by key 
agricultural commodities such as palm 
oil and cocoa coupled with our scale 
and position in the supply chain, we 
recognize that moving to a regenerative 
approach is complex and will take time, 
as well as engagement with partners
