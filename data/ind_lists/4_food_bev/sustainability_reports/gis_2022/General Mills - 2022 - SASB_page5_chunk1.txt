We started this process by developing a 
list of issues to be evaluated based on:
n    Results of our 2018 assessment
n    Peer company ESG disclosures
n     Internal issues management 
prioritization
n      Input from General Mills 
experts and leaders
n    Key reporting disclosure frameworksn    Stakeholder and consumer research
Based on this review and analysis, we 
created and distributed a survey to more 
than 80 external and internal stakeholders 
to assist us with assessing these issues. 
External stakeholders included NGOs, 
industry associations, investors, academic 
institutions, customers, suppliers and 
peer companies. Internal stakeholders 
included subject matter experts and 
leaders from across the company, mostly 
director-level and above and with 
significant experience within General Mills. Stakeholders were asked to assess the 
relative impact of each issue based on 
two dimensions: external impact (the 
impact that General Mills has on society 
and the environment from each issue) 
and internal impact (the impact of each 
issue on the companyâ€™s performance and 
enterprise value, considering factors such 
as revenue, expenses, reputation, risk, 
capital investment, market access and 
financial reporting impacts). The results 
of the survey were aggregated, and each 
issue was placed on a matrix based on its 
relative impact on the two dimensions. This ESG issues assessment and 
prioritization will help guide  
our strategy and reporting and has 
enhanced our understanding of what 
stakeholders feel are currently the most 
impactful issues for our company to 
address. We recognize that all of the 
issues assessed are important and 
interconnected, and do not view this 
assessment in isolation, but rather in 
conjunction with our broader business 
strategy and priorities. For definitions 
and boundaries for each of these 
issues, please refer to the Appendix
