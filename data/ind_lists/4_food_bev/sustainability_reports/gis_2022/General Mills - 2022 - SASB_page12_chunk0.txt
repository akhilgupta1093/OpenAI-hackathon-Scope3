Nutrient-dense foods
Nutrient density is the contribution of 
positive nutrients and food groups, and 
nutrients to limit, per calorie. At General 
Mills, we provide a diverse portfolio 
of products, including many nutrient-
dense foods, that can help consumers 
meet dietary recommendations 
and build healthy eating patterns. 
Focusing on nutrient density — 
rather than just what nutrients have 
been increased or reduced — can 
help best support consumers in 
adopting healthy dietary patterns
