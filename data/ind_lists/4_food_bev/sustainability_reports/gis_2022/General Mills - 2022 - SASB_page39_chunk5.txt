General Mills was 
an early adopter of 
responsible sourcing 
and developed 
a program for 
manufacturing 
facilities producing 
premiums (such as 
toys included in or on 
pack) and supplier 
facilities that license 
our brandsLaunched program  
in our owned 
locations and  
co-packer facilitiesAdded more Tier 1

America and 
expanded to locations 
in Asia, Latin America, 
Europe, and Australia, 
as well as Blue 
Buffalo locations in 
our Pet segmentExpanded program 
to include locations 
of inherently 
high-risk Tier 1 
direct materials 
suppliers in North 
America (suppliers 
that provide 
ingredients used in 
our food products 
or packaging) Global Responsible Sourcing timeline
To segment our Tier 1 suppliers into 
different risk levels, we consider factors 
including geography, ingredient category, 
and the results of prior responsible 
sourcing audits from around the world, 
covering health and safety, human rights, 
business integrity and the environment. 
The audit-related data sources used 
include 3,655 SMETA supplier audits, 
12,763 ISO 14001 supplier audits and 
1,324 SA8000 supplier audits. These 
17,742 supplier audits were concentrated 
in countries with known environmental, social and governance risks, based 
on public sources including the Yale 
Performance Index, the Social Progress 
Global Index, the Worldwide Governance 
Index and the Corruption Perception 
Index. Our segmentation, completed 
in January 2019, was determined 
based on an aggregation of this data. 
We selected these data sources to 
uncover risks as outlined in our Supplier 
Code of Conduct, focused heavily on 
human rights and health and safety.Risk-based segmentation
