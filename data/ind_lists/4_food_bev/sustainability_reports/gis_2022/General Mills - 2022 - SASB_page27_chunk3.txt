Our Statement on Palm Oil Sourcing  
lays out the principles we expect of 
direct suppliers, to ensure that they 
are in line with industry best practices, 
and contains information on our palm 
oil metrics, traceability and grievance 
process. Our approach, as well as the 
industry approach, to responsible 
palm oil is continually evolving and 
we are committed to working with 
our suppliers, peers, competitors and 
partners to support the development 
of a forest-positive, people-positive and 
climate-positive palm oil supply chain. 
General Mills is now more actively 
engaging its suppliers in direct review of 
their palm oil production and sourcing 
practices, moving to traceability to 
mill, and evolving where possible 
to plantation. We work closely with 
our suppliers and industry partners, 
like Proforest, to build sustainability 
performance and compliance 
with our policy commitments 
through active scorecarding, 
conversations and collaboration.  As part of our effort to advance 
progress, General Mills has also joined 
the No-deforestation, No-peat and No-
exploitation Implementation Reporting 
Framework (NDPE IRF) active working 
group â€” a reporting tool designed 
to help companies understand and 
track progress in delivering NDPE 
commitments, including deforestation-
free supply chains. Click here to view our
