Our approach 
While General Mills has minimal 
sourcing exposure to deforestation 
risks, we are committed to eliminating 
deforestation and the resulting impacts 
on biodiversity, endangered species, 
livelihoods and climate change. We 
regularly review our global sourcing 
footprint and focus on commodities 
at high risk of driving deforestation 
and where we can make a meaningful 
impact: cocoa, fiber packaging and 
palm oil. Within these categories, we 
employ a combination of approaches 
designed to help us achieve our 
sourcing goals and drive requirements 
to our upstream supply base
