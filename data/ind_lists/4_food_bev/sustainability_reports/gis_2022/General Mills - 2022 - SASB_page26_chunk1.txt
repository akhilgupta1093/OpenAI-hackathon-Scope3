Rooted in that knowledge, we have 
evolved from individual ingredient 
strategies to programs that help 
regenerate the planet while also 
creating positive outcomes for people. Below is how we have shifted our 
focus for the 10 sustainable sourcing 
priority ingredients. Please refer 
to the Regenerative agriculture , 
Eliminating deforestation, Water 
stewardship and Human rights sections 
for more detail on our strategies 
for these and other ingredients. Ingredient sourcing
General Mills is collaborating with Musim 
Mas Group to invest in a smallholder palm 
farmer engagement program in Aceh Singkil, 
Sumatra, Indonesia, neighboring the Leuser 
ecosystem. We believe that investment and 
collaboration at origin, in partnership with key 
upstream suppliers, can support smallholder 
farmers in addressing environmental, social 
and economic challenges. Our partnership 
with Musim Mas is focused on improving the economic security of smallholder farmers 
and assisting them on their journey toward 
sustainable production, in collaboration 
with local government. Investment from 
General Mills is supporting the hiring of 
village extension officers (VEOs) who 
will provide good agricultural practice, 
financial literacy and no deforestation, no 
peat, no exploitation (NDPE) training 
and resources to smallholders. The program aims to train VEOS in order to 
ultimately provide support to over 1,000 
smallholders in high-priority villages
