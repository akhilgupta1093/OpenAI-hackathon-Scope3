strategic partners to help us enable 
social and environmental progress in 
these value chains, such as our work 
with Conservation International in 
2021 to review and strengthen our 
engagement in seafood supply chains, 
including risk assessment and mitigation 
strategies and identification of potential 
environmental and social impact 
opportunities. Similarly, our partners 
at Proforest conducted a human rights 
risk assessment related to our cocoa, 
sugarcane and palm oil supply chains in 
2021 to enable us to proactively identify 
and respond to potential or emerging 
risk areas. As we learn from our 
partners, we will continue to strengthen 
our approach to address supply chain 
risks. Learn more about our efforts 
in the ingredient sourcing portion of 
the Planet section of this report.Looking ahead: Our journey to 
advance human rights is one of 
continuous improvement. As we grow 
and develop our program, we plan to 
expand our disclosures in line with 
the UNGP reporting framework. Our 
focus in the coming year includes: 
n   Continue building due diligence 
capabilities to proactively identify 
risks where impacts to people are 
most severe across our value chain
n   Integrating human rights considerations 
into environmental strategies
n   Increasing employee awareness of 
our enhanced human rights strategy
n   Continue integrating expectations 
into standard business processes
n   Articulating human rights priorities 
and metrics for measuring impact 
for greater accountability
Our approach: General Mills is 
committed to creating a culture that 
ensures zero harm to our employees 
and the environment. Working safely 
and in an environmentally conscious 
manner is not simply a matter of 
personal accountability or choice. As a 
corporation, we relentlessly seek to learn 
from our work and improve controls 
to prevent and mitigate significant 
safety and environmental events.   Systems: We communicate safety 
information and measure progress 
with the following systems:
n   We use a single, standardized 
Environmental and Safety 
Management System (ESMS) at our 
supply chain locations and ensure 
uniform implementation of standards 
globally through functional auditing 
and a regional support structure.n   Through our Global Safety Tracking 
and Environmental Management 
System (GSTEMS), we track safety 
data at all production facilities 
worldwide, document necessary 
actions to reduce future risks 
and communicate progress
