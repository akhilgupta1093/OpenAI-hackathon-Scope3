As a global food company rooted in 
agriculture, we recognize that we have an impact on human rights beyond just our four walls. While philanthropic programs can play a necessary role in mitigating human rights risks, those programs alone do not offset the potential impact within our value chain. 
Our goal: General Mills is committed to 
respecting the rights of all workers and communities across our value chain. Our goal is to assess and address our human rights impacts in alignment with 
the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs)
