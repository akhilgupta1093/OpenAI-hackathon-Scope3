At General Mills, we actively engage in 
public policy issues that are important 
to our company and stakeholders. 
We are committed to conducting 
these activities in an accountable and 
transparent manner. We articulate 
our approach in the Public Policy for 
the Greater Good area of our website. 
Our public policy priorities include: 
n    Protecting and preserving our planet:  
w  L eading on regenerative agriculture
and soil health â€“ General Mills is a leading voice on regenerative agriculture. We invest to help 
support farmers as they shift 
toward more sustainable practices 
and encourage collaboration and 
investment by governments and 
the private sector, such as our 
support for the Foundation for 
Food and Ag Research (FFAR), a 
critical facilitator of public private 
partnerships between industry 
and farmers. Policy is a critical 
tool to advance this work. We also 
encourage the U.S. Congress to 
strengthen collaboration between organizations, components of our supply chains and domestic 
agriculture producers to meet our ambitious sustainability goals
