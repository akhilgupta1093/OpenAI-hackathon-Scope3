Progress: Three of our 10 priority 
watersheds have active water 
stewardship plans in place. See 
map for details on how we’re 
advancing water stewardship in 
all of our priority watersheds. 
Our actions:
n   Fund and participate in local water 
stewardship activities and policy 
advocacy with NGO partnersn   Maximize water efficiency in owned 
plants in priority watersheds 
n   Advance regenerative agriculture 
in California almonds, a priority 
watershed and high-risk ingredient, 
inspired by water impact in our Kansas

Tier 1
Acute risks –  
Tier 2
Widespread/diffuse risks –  
Tier 3Acute risks – Tier 1: Risk mitigation
Acute risks – Tier 2: Observationn   These high to extremely high watershed impact risks pose financial and brand risk 
due to geographically restricted commodity sourcing or plant impact
n   We implement local solutions to mitigate these risks, often focused on water use reduction and efficiency
EXAMPLE  AWS Certification in Albuquerque cereal/snacks plant 
n    We monitor successful implementation of local solutions, with limited additional input needed  
from General Mills
 EXAMPLE  Observing progress of Central Everglades Planning Project in a key sugarcane sourcing region 
n    These geographically broad watershed risks cannot be pinpointed to water impacts at a specific 
location. As a result, brand risk is low to medium. 
n    We pursue holistic approaches such as regenerative agriculture to address these issues
EXAMPLE  Our regenerative wheat pilot project in the Cheney Lake Watershed in Kansas.Tier 3: Positive impact potential
