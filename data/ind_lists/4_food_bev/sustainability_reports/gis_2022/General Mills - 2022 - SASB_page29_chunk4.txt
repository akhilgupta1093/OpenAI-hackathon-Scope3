Progress: 115,000 acres enrolled 
in pilot programs advancing 
regenerative management
Looking ahead: We’re energized 
by the level of farmer interest in our 
regenerative agriculture pilots and 
are building momentum as we learn 
from these early rollouts. We believe 
regenerative agriculture is the biggest lever in reducing our climate impact, so 
we are piloting a range of strategies 
for accelerating farmer adoption of 
regenerative agriculture in key sourcing 
regions. We are also investing to scale 
regenerative agriculture investments 
and measurement technologies as a 
leading climate lever. We’ve engaged 
SustainCERT to review our carbon 
insetting approach for agricultural GHG 
reductions and removals and have 
released a white paper on the results.Regenerative agriculture
SOIL HEALTH: Soil is a complex ecosystem that forms 
the base of the food chain for humans and land animals. 
It plays an essential role in cleaning and storing water, 
supporting biodiversity and regulating the climate.WATER MANAGEMENT:  
Regenerative agriculture helps maximize  
water infiltration and use efficiency, and can  
reduce agriculture’s impact on water quality,  
helping to protect and restore clean water in  
nearby streams, rivers and lakes.BIODIVERSITY: Diversified cropping 
systems and integration of livestock 
support wildlife and beneficial 
organisms important to keeping pests 
in check and ensuring ecosystem 
resiliency to climate shocks.COW AND HERD WELL-BEING 
(IN DAIRY OPERATIONS ): 
Rotational grazing and feeding 
cows a diverse mix of crops 
support cow health and increase 
resiliency across the whole dairy 
ecosystem.SIX CORE PRINCIPLES OF

COMMUNITY RESILIENCE:   
Regenerative agriculture systems repair  
and enhance ecosystem processes like nutrient 
cycling, water infiltration, and pest suppression, 
reducing the need for more expensive inputs  
and strengthening whole-farm profitability  
and resilience over time.Regenerative agriculture outcomes*Global sourcing footprint excludes acres associated with rotational crops; percentage may be updated in future reports due to changes in our business, improvements in data collection/accuracy or updates to calculation methodology
