Plant-based and vegan products: 
Consumers seek plant-based foods for 
environmental, social and nutritional 
reasons. Our portfolio has long been 
plant-based, with flour, breakfast 
cereals, snack bars, soups and frozen 
fruits and vegetables. More than 800 
of our products are vegan,* including 
Dairy-Free Go-Gurt, most Lärabar 
products, Annie’s fruit snacks and 
Annie’s Organic Vegan Mac. In the yogurt aisle, Oui by Yoplait and Liberté Dairy 
Free (available in Canada) are plant-
based alternatives. Cascadian Farm 
brings plant-based protein to granola 
bars and frozen vegetable blends. 
Through our business development 
and venture capital unit, 301 INC, we 
invest in new brands, including many 
that are plant-based, such as Rhythm 
Superfoods, maker of nutrient-dense 
snacks containing vegetables, fruits and seeds, and Kite Hill, maker of almond-
based non-dairy products. Learn 
more about our investments in food 
innovations on p. 14. Long part of our 
company’s story, plant-based foods are 
an exciting part of General Mills’ future.
