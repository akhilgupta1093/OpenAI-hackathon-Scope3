Safety Excellence and guidance from 
ORCHSE, a division of the U.S. National 
Safety Council (General Mills is an 
ORCSHE member). The new safety metric 
criteria at General Mills are company-
specific and based on the globally 
recognized principles of the ASTM E2920 
international standard for recording 
occupational injuries and illnesses. 
Fiscal 2021 was a baseline year for our 
new safety metrics. Like fiscal 2020, we 
gathered safety data from 198 tracked 
locations, 56 of which are production 
facilities and Innovation, Technology and 
Quality centers. Those 56 locations were 
the focus of our safety improvement 
work. Safety highlights from those 
locations in fiscal 2021 include:
n   Zero General Mills and 
contractor fatalities globally 
n   50% reduction in serious 
injuries vs. fiscal 2020
n   14 locations operated with zero 
reportable injuries this fiscal yearn   A new baseline injury/illness 
rate of 2.14 was established
Beginning in fiscal 2021, our company 
safety incident totals and injury/
illness rate looks different because 
it is based on a subset of the former 
data. We now calculate rate based on 
1,000,000 hours worked as compared 
to 200,000 under U.S. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) Total Injury Rate (TIR) criteria
