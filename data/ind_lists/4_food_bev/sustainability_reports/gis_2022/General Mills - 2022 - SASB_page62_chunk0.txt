Our actions: To ensure no good food 
goes to waste and that the worldâ€™s 
surplus food is used to nourish people, 
we leverage our philanthropy and 
General Mills' deep food system expertise 
to expand surplus food recovery. 
Our efforts and investments have 
resulted in grocery stores, restaurants 
and thousands of other food outlets 
around the globe gaining and adopting 
systematic food recovery solutions so 
that their good surplus food can now 
be used to nourish hungry people 
and does not end up in landfills
