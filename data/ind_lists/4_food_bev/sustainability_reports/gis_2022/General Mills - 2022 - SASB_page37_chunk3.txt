During fiscal 2021, we generated and used 
270,381 gigajoules (GJ) of renewable energy 
and applied renewable energy certificates 
(RECs) and Guarantees of Origins (GOs) that equaled 3,042,771 GJ of electricity. 
These RECs and GOs decreased our GHG 
emissions footprint by 385,346 metric 
tons COâ‚‚e, contributing approximately 10% 
of reduction toward our 2030 full value 
chain goal. See additional details in the 
renewable electricity table in the Appendix
