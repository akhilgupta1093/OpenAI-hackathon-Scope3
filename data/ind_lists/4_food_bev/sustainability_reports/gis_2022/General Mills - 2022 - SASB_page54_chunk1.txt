Our progress: Throughout 2021, 
we listened to our employees, then 
adapted and responded to help meet 
their evolving needs during this year 
of uncertainty, challenges and change. 
Employees told us that flexibility around 
when and how to return to the office was 
critical to their satisfaction and ability 
to do their best work. We introduced 
the “Work with Heart” program in July 
to provide flexibility, guidance and 
resources for new ways of working, 
including hybrid meetings and schedules
