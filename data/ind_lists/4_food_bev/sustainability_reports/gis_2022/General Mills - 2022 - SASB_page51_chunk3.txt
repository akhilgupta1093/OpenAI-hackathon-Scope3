Additionally, General Mills made a 
pledge seven years ago to advance 
the United Nations Women’s 
Empowerment Principles, part of 
the UN Global Compact, to help 
achieve greater equality for women 
in the workplace, marketplace and 
community. These principles are 
designed to promote gender equality 
and women’s empowerment.Women’s empowerment

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
General Mills Women’s Leadership 
Network (WLN) focused on supporting 
its members in three key areas: 
care, flexibility and prioritization. As 
many women around the world 
were downshifting their work 
responsibilities — or exiting their jobs 
as part of the “great resignation” — 
the number of female leaders 
across General Mills increased.*
One of those leaders is Natalia Faiden, 
director of food safety and quality for 
Meals and Baking Solutions in North 
America, who was promoted to this role 
in 2021. She previously led the WLN 
chapter in her native Argentina, now 
leads WLN’s Innovation, Technology 
and Quality (ITQ) functional network 
and served as a cochair for WLN’s 
International Women’s Day (IWD) event in 2021. The event was, for the first 
time, entirely virtual. “It was much more 
inclusive because everyone around the 
world could be present in the same 
way,” said Faiden. More than 3,000 
people from 20 countries participated —  
twice as many as the previous year
