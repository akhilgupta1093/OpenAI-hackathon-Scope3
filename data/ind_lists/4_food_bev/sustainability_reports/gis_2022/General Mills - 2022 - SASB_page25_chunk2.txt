In 2021, General Mills took a leadership 
position by aligning a portion of our 
companyâ€™s financing with our commitment 
to combat climate change. In April 2021, we 
announced the renewal of a five-year $2.7 
billion revolving credit facility, which includes 
a pricing structure tied to environmental 
impact metrics. General Mills was the first 
U.S. consumer packaged goods company 
to put in place a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. By entering into 
this agreement, General Mills receives a 
pricing adjustment based on progress in 
two key areas: reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions in owned operations and using 
renewable electricity for global operations
