n       Informing consumers and increasing 
awareness: We support public policy 
efforts to inform our consumers 
about our products. For example, 
we are active members of several 
organizations that provided comments 
to the USDA requesting that more 
information about bioengineered 
ingredients be made available to 
consumers, not less. Learn more in the
