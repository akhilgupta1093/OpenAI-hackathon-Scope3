Natural and organic brands: We offer a 
mix of certified organic cereals, yogurt, 
frozen fruit and vegetables, snacks, 
meals and baking products. One in eight 
products in our North American portfolio 
is certified organic or made with organic 
ingredients.* While each of these brands 
is unique, they all strive to accelerate work 
in regenerative agriculture and to advance 
leading-edge sustainability programs 
that can be leveraged throughout 
General Mills. Learn more in the Planet  
section of this report about the steps 
we are taking across our supply chain to 
build our organic capacity and expand 
regenerative agriculture practices
