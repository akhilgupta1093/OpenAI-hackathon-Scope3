Through an updated and expanded 
water risk assessment conducted 
in 2019â€“2020, we assessed 20 key 
ingredients in 45 sourcing regions 
and 255 facilities (including 208 in our 
external supply chain), covering 60 
major watershed basins and 221 minor 
watershed subbasins globally. This 
process included factors such as water 
quantity, water quality and reputation. 
We used the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 
and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 
Water Risk Filter in this assessment
