Affordable and accessible: We believe 
in providing affordable, accessible 
nutrient-dense foods that people love. 
We do this in a variety of ways, including 
offering nutrient-dense products, like 
ready-to-eat cereal and yogurt, that 
meet the nutrition guidelines for U.S. 
federal nutrition assistance programs, such as the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC), the Child and 
Adult Care Food Program (CACFP), the 
School Breakfast Program (SBP) and the 
National School Lunch Program (NSLP). 
Through our philanthropic partnerships 
and tied to our companyâ€™s purpose, 
we are committed to building food-
secure communities. Examples include enabling 30 billion meals to be provided 
for hungry people by 2030, increasing 
reliable food access for 10 million people 
struggling with food insecurity by 2030 
and investing to expand the capability 
of food bank networks globally. Learn

security by expanding food access for
