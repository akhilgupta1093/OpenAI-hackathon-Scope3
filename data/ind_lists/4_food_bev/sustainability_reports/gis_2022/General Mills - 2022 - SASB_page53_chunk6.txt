Certification sponsorship program
“Working with General Mills has had a greatly positive impact on our business. Because 
of our certification through WBENC, we’ve been able to secure retailers we wouldn’t 
have in the past. Our certification has led to a distribution partnership that has vastly 
broadened our potential retail footprint. We’re incredibly grateful to the General Mills 
team for their continued support.” — Claire Smith, Founder, Tenera GrainsIn 2021, we launched a 
supplier diversity certification 
sponsorship program to fund 
and support small diverse 
businesses in attaining their 
diverse certification. The 
first participant was Tenera 
Grains, maker of innovative 
Teffola granola made from 
the ancient grain teff. After achieving WBENC certification 
as a woman-owned business, 
Tenera Grains made it to 
the finals of the WBENC 
NextGen Pitch Competition.
