Supplier diversity
Our approach: General Mills has been 
committed to establishing and growing 
relationships with certified diverse 
suppliers in the U.S. for more than 
50 years, providing opportunity to 
underrepresented groups while fostering 
job creation and economic development.* 
By requiring businesses to be certified 
by our partner advocacy organizations, 
we stay true to our goal of providing 
diverse suppliers with greater access to 
our spending while bringing credibility 
through third-party authentication. These 
inclusion efforts also support General 
Mills by delivering innovation, agility, 
cost savings and market insights about 
our increasingly diverse consumers. 
Our Supplier Diversity Team, which is 
embedded in our Global Supply Chain 
organization, builds partnerships across 
the company to match diverse suppliers 
with business needs and opportunities. 
The team integrates supplier diversity 
into the standard sourcing process, trains 
all sourcing buyers and provides tools to 
advance the program. Sourcing category 
managers incorporate diversity into their 
strategic plans to drive progress and 
share results with sourcing leadership. 
Our approach in recent years has 
evolved by applying robust data, 
standard processes and business 
integration that mirrors our 
sourcing organization workflow
