Palm Oil: General Mills is a relatively 
small buyer of palm oil, using less 
than 0.5% of global palm oil supply in 
products like baking mixes, biscuits, 
and snack products. Despite the size 
of our purchase, we recognize that 
our purchasing practices toward 
deforestation-free palm oil can positively impact ecosystems as well as drive 
progress toward our science-based 
GHG emissions reduction to Scope 3. 
To help ensure our palm oil purchases 
do not contribute to deforestation of 
the worldâ€™s rainforests or negatively 
impact the communities and habitats 
that depend on them, we have 
sourced 100% of our palm oil as 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 
certified sustainable since 2015
