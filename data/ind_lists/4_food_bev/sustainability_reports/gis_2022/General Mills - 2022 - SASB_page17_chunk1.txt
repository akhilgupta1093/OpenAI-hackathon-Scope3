We adhere to strict internal and  
industry guidelines — often more 
demanding than local regulations —  in producing and reviewing ads to 
ensure they are appropriate for the 
intended audience. Beyond complying 
with applicable law, we ensure that our 
ads are consistent with our core values. 
When possible, our advertising aims to 
reflect the diversity of society. And our 
advertising reflects generally accepted standards of social behavior, avoids 
stereotyping people and never insults 
or demeans any demographic groups
