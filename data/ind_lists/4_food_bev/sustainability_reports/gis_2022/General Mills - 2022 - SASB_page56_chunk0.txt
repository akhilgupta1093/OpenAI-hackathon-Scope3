Development 
and training
Our approach: Development of all 
employees is a core value at General Mills. 
A recent employee engagement survey 
revealed that 81% of employees feel 
they have the opportunity to grow and 
develop at General Mills.* Learning is a 
key ingredient of our approach, including 
formal and informal mentorship programs, 
employee network connections and a 
range of development opportunities 
at all stages of employees’ careers:
n   New employee orientation and a 
12-week onboarding process
n   Hands-on experiences, including 
challenging work assignments 
and robust job rotationsn   Guidance from others, including 
feedback from managers, 
mentors and peers
n   Real-time learning resources for 
leaders and all employees
n   Structured learning — offered both 
in person and online — including 
onboarding for new employees, 
professional development for all 
and leadership development
n   Our performance management 
process, in which more than 
19,300 employees globally 
participated in fiscal 2021
Our progress: In 2021, we launched 
a new performance management 
process and continued to accelerate 
our Engaging Leader initiative, which 
we introduced in 2017 to transform the way our leaders support employees and 
live our values to drive performance 
and engagement. In 2021, we advanced 
Engaging Leader programs to adapt 
to new ways of working and tailored 
training formats for manufacturing 
locations in order to address the 
different needs of each employee 
group. The key behaviors that are 
the focus of this training vary slightly 
between our manufacturing sites 
and nonmanufacturing locations. 
Manufacturing teams globally focused 
on: explicit strategic intent — so 
employees understand the “why” 
behind the work; knowing and 
appreciating each team member to 
help build a culture of belonging; 
and embracing a learning mindset to 
encourage team and personal growth
