Fiber packaging: General Mills 
sources 100% of our fiber packaging 
from recycled material or from virgin 
wood fiber regions where there 
is demonstrably low risk of any 
deforestation. In 2021, 99% of our 
fiber packaging supply is considered 
at low risk of contributing to global 
deforestation because the packaging 
uses either recycled materials or virgin 
fiber that is sourced from regions 
where deforestation is not occurring
