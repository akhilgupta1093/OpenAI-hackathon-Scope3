In early 2021, General Mills 
launched the first store 
drop-off recyclable snack bar 
wrapper for our Nature Valley 
bars, coupled with a consumer 
education campaign on how 
to recycle them. Wrappers 
recycled through store 
drop-off programs are 
turned into new materials 
like composite lumber.To encourage adoption of this 
technology and accelerate 
the benefits of scale, General 
Mills has decided to not 
pursue a patent. We urge 
others in the industry to 
develop recyclable solutions, 
including polyethylene-
based designs that can be 
certified for recycling within 
the store drop-off program.In 2019, Annie’s Homegrown 
and supply chain partners 
Charter NEX and Envision 
Plastics worked together 
to develop a new cereal 
liner that uses at least 35% 
postconsumer recycled 
(PCR) HDPE and is suitable 
for direct food contact. The 
Annie’s Friends cereal box 
includes special consumer-
facing messaging around 
the use of recycled content.Launching food-grade PCR 
is revolutionary for the 
industry and took more 
than 20 years to develop 
from idea to on-pack. 
We have expanded the use 
of PCR film from one product 
to the full portfolio of Annie’s 
cereals and are now moving 
to include it in Cascadian 
Farms cereal as well.General Mills recognized for innovation by Sustainable Packaging Coalition
