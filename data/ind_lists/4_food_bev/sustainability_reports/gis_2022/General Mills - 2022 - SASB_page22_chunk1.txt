Leadership and governance: The 
Global Impact Governance Committee (GIGC), led by our Chairman and CEO and overseen by the Board’s Public Responsibility committee, is accountable for our sustainability program. The Chairman and CEO convenes the GIGC at least three times each year to establish, direct and oversee General Mills’ positions on matters of significance to the company and its stakeholders concerning corporate social responsibility, environmental and sustainability issues, and philanthropy. These matters are included in our Chairman and CEO’s annual performance objectives and impact his compensation. The GIGC, which was formalized in 2021, is an evolution from the previous Sustainability Governance Committee and reflects the continued integration of sustainability into the company and the understanding that our ambitious targets will require alignment, operationalization and investment across the company
