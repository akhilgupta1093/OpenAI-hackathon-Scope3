Our approach: Whether marketing 
to children or adults, we present 
the qualities and advantages of our 
products truthfully, responsibly and 
with appropriate taste. We take special 
care with respect to child audiences. 
We believe that children should be 
encouraged to consume lower-calorie, nutrient-dense foods that support their 
growth and activity. Learn more about 
our commitment to maintain the highest
