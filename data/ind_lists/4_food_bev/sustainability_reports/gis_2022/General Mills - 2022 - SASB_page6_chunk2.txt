For example, in May 2021 General Mills 
hosted our first-ever ESG investor 
event, held virtually. The event included 
a pre-recorded presentation as well 
as a live question-and-answer session 
with management. The engagement 
reached more than 300 attendees 
and highlighted the Force for Good 
pillar of the company’s Accelerate 
strategy, focusing on how General Mills 
is regenerating the planet, improving 
food security, strengthening communities 
and advancing inclusion among the 
company’s people and through its brands.The Global Impact Governance 
Committee, led by our Chairman and 
CEO and overseen by the Board’s 
Public Responsibility Committee, is 
accountable for our global responsibility 
programs. The Board’s Public 
Responsibility Committee provides 
extensive oversight and receives regular 
updates from the operating teams
