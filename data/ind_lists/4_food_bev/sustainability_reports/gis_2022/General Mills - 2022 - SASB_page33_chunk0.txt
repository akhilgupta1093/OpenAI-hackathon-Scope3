Water is essential for life — for drinking 
and sanitation, and to grow food, 
generate power, support commerce 
and nurture ecosystems. Ecosystems, 
including the farms that grow our 
ingredients, rely on a healthy global and 
local water cycle. So as a food company, 
General Mills too depends on water. On 
average, agriculture accounts for 70% of 
global freshwater withdrawals, and the 
food sector faces increasing risks related 
to water quality and availability. This 
underscores the leadership role General 
Mills and other food companies must 
take to address water stewardship issues. 
The General Mills Water Policy   
provides a framework for engaging  
with stakeholders and improving  
the health of watersheds that are  critical to our business, and we are  
signatories to the United Nations  
CEO Water Mandate. We focus on water use from 
watershed to production, identify 
opportunities to increase efficiency, conservation, and regeneration (or 
recharge), and continually improve 
performance and enhance resiliency.Water stewardship
As General Mills advances our 
work in regenerative agriculture, 
improved water efficiency 
and quality are some of the 
targeted outcomes. Regenerative 
agriculture can help to restore 
the water cycle on farms by 
enhancing water infiltration in soil 
and reducing water losses due to 
evaporation. This leads to more 
efficient use of water resources on 
farms and minimizes the runoff of soil, nutrients, and chemicals that 
can contaminate waterways — 
outcomes which we are monitoring 
as part of our regenerative 
agriculture commitment. 
We know that the holistic benefits 
of regenerative agriculture, 
including improved water 
outcomes, can benefit a wide 
variety of stakeholders. In 2020, 
General Mills commissioned 
Ecotone Analytics, in collaboration 
with the Cheney Lake Watershed, 
Kansas Department of Health 
and Environment, and No-till on the Plains, to conduct an 
Impact Analysis to estimate 
the social return on investment 
for regenerative agriculture in 
the Cheney Lake Watershed, 
where General Mills has a 
regenerative agriculture pilot. 
The study found that for every 
US$1 in costs to implement 
regenerative principles on-farm, 
there is approximately US$5 in 
social return on investment to 
farmers/landowners, taxpayers, 
local communities, municipal 
water plants and water users.Water and regenerative agricultureFarms that grow our ingredients depend on water

*Estimation is a first approximation of value realized from RA practices. Additional 
benefits per acre will vary over time and by location within the watershed.Projected 400% social return

For every $1 contributed toward regenerative 
agriculture in the watershed, approximately 
$5 in additional social, environmental 
and economic value is generated in 
comparison to conventional practices.*
