A force for good in Northeast Philadelphia
For the past seven years, an average 
of 20 to 30 General Mills employees 
annually have been volunteering at 
the Frankford Boys and Girls Club in 
Northeast Philadelphia, serving as mentors, 
supporting youth leadership activities and 
helping to host holiday celebrations. During 
that time, General Mills also supported a 
major renovation of the club’s decaying facility through community grants and 
many hours of volunteer time, including 
monthly visits to help with demolition 
and improvements to the building’s 
interior, exterior and surrounding area. 
Since completion of the renovation, 
enrollment and participation have increased 
500% — from 40 kids to more than 200 
daily and nearly 300 in the summer. “We look forward to further expanding 
our strong partnership with the Boys 
and Girls Club and truly being a force for 
good. We can be proud of the impact 
General Mills is having with these amazing 
kids and our communities,” said Billy 
Watts, Customer Vice President East 
and Industry Relations, General Mills
