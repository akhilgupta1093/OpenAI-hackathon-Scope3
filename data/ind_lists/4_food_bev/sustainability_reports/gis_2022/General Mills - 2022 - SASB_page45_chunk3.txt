Due diligence: We have put in place a 
range of due diligence measures for our 
own operations and supply chains. These 
measures include audits conducted as part of our Global Responsible 
Sourcing program, which uses the 
four-pillar Sedex Members Ethical Trade 
Audit (SMETA) protocol or mutually 
recognized audits to assess our supply 
chain on social and environmental 
practices. We recognize our policies 
and programs may not prevent all 
adverse impacts in our value chain. Our 
aim is to provide effective responses 
where we find impacts directly linked 
to our business operations. We have 
in place a variety of mechanisms to 
allow employees, stakeholders and other potentially affected individuals 
to raise grievances, such as our Ethics 
Line. Learn more about our efforts in
