Our actions 
We have multiple workstreams underway 
to accelerate the implementation of 
regenerative agriculture principles:
Pilot programs: To advance adoption 
of regenerative agriculture, we have 
partnered with Soil Health Academy 
and Understanding Ag to activate pilots 
across three of our priority ingredient 
sourcing regions (see map). Each of these 
pilots provide farmers with practical tools 
to implement regenerative agriculture 
including one-on-one coaching and 
technical assistance for three years, 
customized plans for implementation 
in their operations, soil health testing, 
farmer networking communities, access to regenerative agriculture workshops, 
and biodiversity and economic 
assessments to demonstrate impact 
on outcomes over time. Learn more
