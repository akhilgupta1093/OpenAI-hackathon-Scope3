Our commitment: As a member of 
the International Food and Beverage 
Alliance (IFBA), General Mills has made a 
commitment to adopt a common global approach to nutrition information on 
packaging that includes, at minimum, 
the labeling of calories on front-of-pack. 
This initiative was implemented globally 
during 2014-2016 to inform consumers 
about specific product nutrition 
attributes. In countries with front-of-
pack labelling requirements, we adhere 
exclusively to the local regulation. We 
also commit not to place any regulated 
health or nutrition claim on a product 
unless it meets the criteria set forth by 
the regulations in the country of sale.Our progress: Around the world, 
our product labeling meets local 
regulatory requirements while remaining 
consistent with our global approach. 
Examples of our compliance with local 
and regional guidelines include:
n   Australia â€“ 100% of our products 
display nutrition intake information 
in front-of-pack labeling, consistent 
with the Australian Daily Intake 
Guide and IFBA requirements
