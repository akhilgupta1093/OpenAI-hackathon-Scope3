Through the GoodWorks program, a 
cross-functional team of General Mills 
employees helped the Minnesota 
Department of Human Services 
develop a campaign to raise awareness 
about how Minnesotans in need can 
access food assistance through the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program (SNAP). The GoodWorks 
team conducted research, formulated a 
strategy and supported the campaignâ€™s 
execution with media activation, 
website assistance and a toolkit for 
organizations to use in helping to 
spread the word. Key outcomes of 
the outreach campaign include:n   More than 17,000 SNAP 
applicants received assistance
