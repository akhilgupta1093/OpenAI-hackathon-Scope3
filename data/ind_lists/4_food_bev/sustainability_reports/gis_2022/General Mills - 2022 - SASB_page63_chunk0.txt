Regenerative agriculture: Philanthropic impact
Focus area Goal PartnersOur approach: We leverage philanthropy to advance 
regenerative agriculture practices and support the conservation 
of natural resources and ecosystems around the world. 
Complementing our company’s broader sustainability and  
regenerative commitments, we invest in NGO-led initiatives that  
increase farmers’ economic resilience and advance respect for  
human rights, improve soil and water health and increase biodiversity 
through improved pollinator health and habitat. Learn more in the  
Planet section of this report. 
We also actively engage in public policy discussions  
to advance sustainability priorities — see related details

Improving the well-being of  
farming communities
The philanthropic support* we provide 
to NGO partners, including CARE in Côte 
d’Ivoire and Ghana and Positive Planet in 
Madagascar, is helping smallholder farming 
communities improve their livelihoods and 
farming practices, empower female farmers, 
establish farmer cooperatives, increase 
food and nutrition security, support youth 
education and prevent child labor. These 
efforts collectively reach more than 58,400 
smallholder farmers and their family members.
