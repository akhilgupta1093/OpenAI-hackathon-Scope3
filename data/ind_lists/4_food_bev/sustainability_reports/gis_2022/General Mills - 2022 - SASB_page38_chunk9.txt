We are part of an industry effort to 
standardize food date labels to improve 
clarity about food quality and safety and 
reduce the amount of good food that’s 
thrown away. As of June 2021, we have 
updated 100% of our U.S. packages.General Mills is committed to increasing 
surplus food recovery, especially among 
consumer-facing food businesses — 
grocery stores, restaurants and other food 
outlets. These organizations collectively 
account for 28% of all food waste, roughly 
50 billion pounds (more than 20 million 
metric tons) per year in the U.S. alone.*
During the past four years, our global 
investments in food recovery technology 
have empowered more than 43,000 
retail and foodservice locations to 
participate in systematic food rescue.General Mills provides philanthropic support 
to leading nonprofits that makes it possible 
for food manufacturers, grocers, restaurants, 
distributors, trucking companies and other 
organizations to donate surplus food so 
it can be distributed to people in need
