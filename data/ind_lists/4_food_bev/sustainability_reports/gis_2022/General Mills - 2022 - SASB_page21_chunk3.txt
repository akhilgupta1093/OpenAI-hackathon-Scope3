We recognize the need to accelerate our 
decarbonization, so we have evolved our 
Global Impact governance structure to 
include General Millsâ€™ executives from the business and all key functions, enabling 
better integration, prioritization, resourcing 
and operationalization of key global impact 
priorities. We have also invested time 
and focus in developing a recommended 
new operating model that creates cross-
functional integration, investment and 
accountability in reaching our shared 
goals. We know we need to drive systemic 
change if we aim to hit our goals, and we 
believe these new structures will help to 
accelerate progress toward our ambitions.  
Thank you for your interest in our work 
to help create a more resilient planet
