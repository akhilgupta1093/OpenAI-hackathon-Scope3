In 2021, we introduced 
our limited-edition 
Cascadian Farm Climate 
Smart Kernza Grains 
Cereal in Whole Foods 
stores. The cereal is 
made with Kernza® 
sourced through our 
partnership with The 
Land Institute. We have 
been working together 
to scale up the supply 
of organic Kernza since 2017 because of this 
perennial grain’s deep 
roots, which increase 
soil health and drought 
resistance, prevent 
erosion and store critical 
nutrients — along with 
carbon — in the soil. The 
environmental benefits 
of Kernza grains are 
highlighted on the 
cereal packaging
