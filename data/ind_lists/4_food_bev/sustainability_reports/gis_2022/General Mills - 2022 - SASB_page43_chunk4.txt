Ethics and compliance: General Mills 
is committed to conducting business 
in an ethical manner that upholds 
best practices, protects human rights, 
complies with regulations, demonstrates 
integrity, provides equal opportunity 
and supports fair labor practices. Our 
comprehensive Code of Conduct and 
Ethics & Compliance program promote 
ethical behavior in all aspects of our 
employees’ work. In support of our 
Code of Conduct, the company has 
24 corporate-level policies that outline 
more detailed compliance expectations. 
They cover topics such as food 
safety, workplace safety, appropriate 
advertising, business conduct standards, 
anti-corruption and ethical sourcing. 
Annually, more than 10,000 company 
leaders — from managers upward —  must attest to compliance with 
our Code of Conduct and business 
conduct policies. Employees receive 
additional training on these policies, 
and our Ethics Line — which is easily 
accessible on our intranet and external 
website — allows employees worldwide 
to ask questions or raise concerns 
confidentially and anonymously. 
Our anti-corruption program includes 
employee training and assesses 
corruption risks with our third-party 
suppliers. All allegations of third-party 
corruption or employee misconduct 
are promptly and thoroughly 
investigated and shared in regular 
updates with the Audit Committee of 
the Board of Directors. Our Supplier 
Code of Conduct outlines our ethical 
expectations and is included in our 
contracts with business partners.Our approach
