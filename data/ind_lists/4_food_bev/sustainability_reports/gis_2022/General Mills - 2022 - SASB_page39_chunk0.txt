Our approach 
At General Mills, we are responsible for 
maintaining high standards not only in 
our own operations, but also across our 
value chain. Our supplier base is large, 
complex and global, with thousands 
of suppliers in more than 25 countries. 
Through our Global Responsible Sourcing 
program, we uphold our Supplier Code 
of Conduct and drive ongoing supplier 
progress in the areas of health and 
safety, human rights, business integrity 
and the environment. This increases 
our influence to protect and respect 
the people who supply, transform and 
manufacture the goods and services 
we use to make our products
