v Lucy Buteyo, a senior quality engineer at 
General Mills, participated as a PFS mentor 
with Oyeyemi Fadairo (pictured here), who 
was a quality control lead at Wilson’s Juice 
in Nigeria. They met monthly for 6 months 
during 2021 to discuss skills and design a 
food safety plan. 
“I joined the mentorship program because 
I wanted to reciprocate the mentoring 
opportunities I have been fortunate to 
receive during my career and share my 
knowledge and skills for good,” said Buteyo
