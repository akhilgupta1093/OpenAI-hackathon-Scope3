Our approach 
General Mills recognizes the imperative 
of using our scale to drive sustainable 
and meaningful change. We are 
dedicated to becoming a reflection 
of the world we seek, where equity 
and inclusion are a reality for us all. 
We know that meaningful change 
takes time — and it will take all of 
us to make progress at both the 
systemic and individual levels — and 
we are committed to continuing this 
critical journey with the strong belief 
that we can be a force for good
