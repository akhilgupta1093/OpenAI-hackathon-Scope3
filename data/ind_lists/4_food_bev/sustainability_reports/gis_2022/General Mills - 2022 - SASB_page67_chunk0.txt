Skills-based volunteerism: Many of 
our employees apply their professional 
skills and knowledge to make a 
difference at the local and societal 
levels, including through our in-house 
GoodWorks pro-bono program and 
our international nonprofit partner, 
Partners in Food Solutions:
n   GoodWorks: Through GoodWorks, 
General Mills employees lend their 
expertise in marketing, finance, sourcing 
and supply chain management, 
innovation, technology and quality 
to help nonprofit organizations 
overcome challenges and scale up 
their impact. Since the program began 
in 2009, more than 200 volunteers 
have completed over 60 projects. 
  In 2020, the GoodWorks program 
expanded its community focus to 
provide targeted support for local 
nonprofits and small businesses owned 
by Black, Indigenous and people of 
color. In 2021, GoodWorks teams in Minnesota provided support to eight 
small businesses owned by people 
of color and nonprofit organizations 
serving people of color in Minneapolis 
and St. Paul, including marketing and 
business assistance for their projects. 
n   Partners in Food Solutions: Our 
employees volunteer with Partners in 
Food Solutions (PFS), an independent 
nonprofit organization that links the 
technical and business expertise of

companies with high-potential food

Through the program, more than 725 General Mills employees globally 
have contributed over 78,000 hours 
to 306 different clients across Africa. 
By sharing their diverse expertise, General Mills employees have assisted
