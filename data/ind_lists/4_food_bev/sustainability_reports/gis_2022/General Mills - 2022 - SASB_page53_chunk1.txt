sources to continually locate and 
verify certified diverse suppliers

and vetting process to expand 
our potential partner base
n   Measured bid inclusion and win 
rate to highlight capable suppliers 
across multiple platforms

to launch, expanding our expectations 
for inclusion to our supply base and 
increasing overall diverse spending 
by more than $55,000,000

sponsorship program to help small 
or startup businesses achieve diverse 
certification status with funding and 
consulting support from General Mills
n   Made a corporate commitment to 
double spending with minority-owned 
businesses and achieved this goal in 
fiscal 2021 by increasing spending 
with minority-owned businesses
