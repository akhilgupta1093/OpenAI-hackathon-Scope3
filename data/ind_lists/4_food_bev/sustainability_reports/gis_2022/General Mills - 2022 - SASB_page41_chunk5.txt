1.5K 5+ <100In June 2020, General Mills launched 
a three-year pilot in Western Michigan 
to advance regenerative principles 
at dairies that produce fluid milk for 
our yogurt products, including Yoplait. 
The pilot provides dairy farmers 
education and coaching to implement 
regenerative principles such as 
growing and using diverse mixtures of crops for feed to support both soil 
and animal health. Working with the 
University of Wisconsin–Madison and 
Cornell University, we are collecting a 
comprehensive set of animal metrics 
with the goal of understanding cow 
health and welfare as an integral 
part of the dairy ecosystem. 
These dairies manage 
14,000 acres of crop land 
to feed their cows. Our goal 
is to introduce regenerative 
principles on 1,500 acres.The pilot farms represent 
more than 5 generations of 
dairy farming. Regenerative 
agriculture works with a farm’s 
natural ecosystem to improve 
overall resiliency and support 
farmer profitability.The milk from these pilot 
farms travels less than  
100 miles to fill your favorite 
cup of Yoplait.ACRES GENERATIONS MILES
