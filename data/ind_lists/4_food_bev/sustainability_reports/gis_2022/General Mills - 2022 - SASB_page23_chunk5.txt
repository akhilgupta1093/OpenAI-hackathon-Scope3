Fiscal 2021 progress: In fiscal 2021, 
our absolute GHG emissions footprint increased 2% compared to our fiscal 
2020 baseline. This reflects business 
growth during the year as General 
Mills increased production to make 
food the world needed during the 
pandemic and company-wide net 
sales increased 3%. Almost all parts 
of our value chain saw an increase in 
emissions (see value chain breakdown on next page). See the Appendix for 
additional details on our GHG emissions 
and calculation methodology
