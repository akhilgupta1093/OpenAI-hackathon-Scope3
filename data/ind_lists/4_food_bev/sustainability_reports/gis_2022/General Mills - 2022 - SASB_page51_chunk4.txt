“WLN has provided a safe space to 
find my voice and my purpose with 
opportunities for networking and 
mentoring by women leaders who 
inspire me. Now I am helping pave the 
way for others,” said Faiden. “During 
the pandemic, women have been 
disproportionately affected as they 
juggle duties in the workplace and 
at home, so WLN has put empathy 
front and center in our programming. 
We provided input on the need 
for flexibility and for policies that 
support employee well-being.”
