We believe one of the biggest barriers to 
widespread regenerative agriculture adoption 
is the shortage of experienced conservation 
professionals to help farmers implement 
regenerative agricultural systems. General 
Mills has partnered with the National Fish 
and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to help 
overcome this barrier by enabling greater 
local impact and providing more financial resources to farmers to reduce the economic 
risk of implementing new practices. The 
NFWF–General Mills partnership will support 
the hiring of field conservation professionals 
who will work directly with landowners 
to develop and implement planning and 
stewardship actions that generate economic 
benefits alongside positive environmental 
outcomes. Locally led programs will offer assistance that is adaptable to each 
producer’s unique goals, experience, risk 
tolerance, and other considerations on their 
path to a regenerative system. By focusing on 
the Great Lakes Basin and the Southern Great 
Plains, this effort prioritizes areas that are 
important for fish and wildlife, and advances 
regenerative agriculture principles in key 
ingredient sourcing regions for General Mills.General Mills’ investment with NFWF will be 
matched at a 2:1 ratio by the USDA National 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) 
and local conservation organizations.Scaling regional impact through partnershipResearch partnerships: Our regenerative 
agriculture commitment is the product 
of many long-term partnerships and 
investments. Just as we are working to 
help farmers implement regenerative 
principles, we are working with scientists 
to advance our understanding of complex 
farm ecosystems and the impacts of 
regenerative agriculture. Below are 
some of the partners we’ve worked 
with recently to study the soil health, 
biodiversity, climate, and economic 
impacts of regenerative systems.Brand activations: We know that our 
consumers care about where and how 
the ingredients in their food are grown. 
We work to advance regenerative 
agriculture by developing products 
with ingredients using regenerative 
principles. As we continue our 
journey to communicate and establish 
the importance of regenerative 
agriculture to consumers, on-pack 
messaging is a powerful way for us 
to introduce commitments, progress, 
and the farmers with whom we 
are partnering in this journey.Market opportunities: We work to 
increase market opportunities for 
farmers using regenerative management 
techniques. General Mills is a Founding 
Circle member of the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC) and 
is working to advance market-based 
incentive mechanisms for farmers who 
reduce their environmental impacts
