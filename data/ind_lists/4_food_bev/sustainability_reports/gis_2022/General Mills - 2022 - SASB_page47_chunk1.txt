We continued reinforcing our safety 
programs in fiscal 2021:
n   Standards – We published our 
first-ever standard focused 
specifically on SIF prevention. 
n   Measurement – We leveraged our 
fiscal 2020 safety metrics change and 
improved our capability to identify 
and reduce SIF potential globally (we 
identified and took action to address 
over 1,100 potential SIF incidents in 
fiscal 2021). We also deployed new company environmental metrics 
and began data capture related to 
significant environmental incidents. 
n   Mitigation – We recalibrated the 
safety and environmental aspects 
of our capital expenditure process 
to prioritize funding and improve 
controls related to our critical 
safety and environmental risks. 
n   Learning and culture – We introduced 
additional global learning experiences 
focused on critical risk management 
and SIF prevention. We also began 
development of our next safety 
culture offering, Safety Leadership 2.0, 
which is based on current human and 
organizational performance principles.  
Leadership and responsibility:
n   Our Global Safety Governance Board, 
composed of regional operating vice 
presidents, oversees safety leadership, 
structure, processes and actions.n   Senior-level responsibility for workplace 
safety lies with the Director of Global 
Safety and Environment, who reports 
to the Chief Supply Chain Officer
