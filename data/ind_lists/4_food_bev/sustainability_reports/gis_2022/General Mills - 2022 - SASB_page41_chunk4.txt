Looking ahead: We see potential for 
regenerative agriculture to provide 
a paradigm shift in agricultureâ€™s 
approach to farm animal well-being, 
from incremental improvement to 
an animal- and ecosystem-centered 
approach. We are only just beginning to 
explore the opportunities here, starting 
in dairy. We are excited for the journey 
and learning opportunities ahead
