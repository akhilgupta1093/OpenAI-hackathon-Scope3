To view additional data about GHG 
emissions, energy usage in our 
directly controlled operations, and 
water and solid waste, see the 
Environmental data summary .Food waste: In 2020, we announced 
a goal to reduce food waste in our 
operations by 50% by 2030.*** In 
2021 we had reduced our food 
waste volume by 24% compared to 
2020. In fiscal 2021, 0.5% of our total 
production volume was food waste.**** 
We participate in numerous initiatives 
to decrease food waste in operations 
and beyond, such as the U.S. Food Loss 
and Waste 2030 Champions, Friends of 
Champions 12.3 and Consumer Goods 
Forum Food Waste Coalition of Action.
