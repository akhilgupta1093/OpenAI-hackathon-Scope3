Tier 1 suppliers: Tier 1 direct suppliers 
(suppliers that provide ingredients used 
in our food products or packaging) are 
rated by inherent country and goods 
risk using external data sources and 
are segmented into different risk levels. 
(See box for details.) From fiscal 2018 
to fiscal 2020, inherently high-risk Tier 1 direct suppliers were asked to complete 
a self-assessment questionnaire followed 
by an audit for the subset of those 
suppliers identified as highest risk. In 
fiscal 2021, we shifted management 
of our audit program to in-house and 
expanded the scope to additional 
geographies and business segments. 
We also simplified our program 
by eliminating the self-assessment 
questionnaire and only requiring a 
SMETA compliant audit to decrease 
supplier time and resource requirements 
and improve the effectiveness of the 
program. All suppliers are expected 
to comply and participate in the 
program by submitting a SMETA-
compliant audit when requested
