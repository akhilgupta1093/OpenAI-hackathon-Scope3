Risk management
Climate change is included as a risk in our company-wide Enterprise Risk 
Management (ERM) process. To better understand our climate risk, in 2020  
General Mills commissioned Trucost/S&P Global to assess its climate-related transition 
and physical risks and opportunities in line with the TCFD recommendations.The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) develops voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies to provide information to stakeholders. 
General Mills supports this initiative and is committed to providing our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. A summary of our approach to each of the key pillars can 
be found below. Additional details on how we address the recommendations can be found in the TCFD index on our website and in our CDP Climate disclosure . Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

The Board’s Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the company’s 
sustainability work — including our climate program. In addition, our Chairman  
and CEO convenes the Global Impact Governance Committee at least three  
times each year to review and approve climate-related strategies, programs  
and key investments.Strategy 
As more than 85% of our overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occur 
outside of General Mills operations, our climate strategy focuses on driving 
transformation and reducing emissions across our entire value chain. Our 
General Mills Policy on Climate outlines our approach to mitigation, adaptation, 
disclosure and advocacy
