r Some of General Mills products 
made with ingredients grown using 
regenerative principlesGeneral Mills, the Kansas Department 
of Health and Environment (KDHE) 
and the Ecosystem Services Market 
Consortium (ESMC) are partnering to 
pilot test ESMC’s program that rewards 
farmers for generating ecosystem 
services like greenhouse gas reduction 
and water quality improvement through 
regenerative agriculture. In the pilot, 
launched in 2020, General Mills and 
KDHE are testing ESMC’s protocols and 
processes to measure environmental 
impacts and pay farmers for soil carbon 
sequestration, reduced greenhouse 
gases, and improved water quality. 
The pilot is a 
leading example 
of public and private sectors coming together to 
quantify environmental improvements 
and compensate farmers for the 
environmental benefits they produce 
through regenerative agriculture
