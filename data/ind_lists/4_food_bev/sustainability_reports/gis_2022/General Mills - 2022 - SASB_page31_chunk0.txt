Advancing measurement and 
technology: General Mills believes that 
measuring environmental and economic 
outcomes is critical to ensure that 
implementing regenerative agriculture 
leads to desirable outcomes. We are 
leading the industry in developing robust 
scientific methodologies to monitor 
and study the outcomes associated 
with regenerative agriculture in order 
to ensure credibility of our efforts.In partnership with numerous scientific 
organizations, we are conducting in-depth 
research on the impacts of regenerative 
management on soil health and carbon 
sequestration, water quality and 
conservation, insect and bird biodiversity, 
and farm economics. In addition to this 
farm-level research, we are implementing 
technologies that will allow us to quantify 
environmental impacts across entire 
regions where we source key ingredients. Using satellite imagery, we have begun 
to track changes in agriculture practices 
such as cover crops and no-till on 
the landscape over time and model 
the resulting impacts on metrics like 
greenhouse gas emissions. We are also 
developing more scalable approaches 
to monitoring biodiversity across farms, 
utilizing microphones for recording birds 
and light sensors to detect insects
