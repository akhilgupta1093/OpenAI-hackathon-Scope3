The General Mills Political Action 
Committee (G-PAC) is run by employees 
and uses employee funds to make 
political contributions to federal and, 
in limited cases, state candidates. No corporate treasury funds are used for 
federal candidate contributions, but 
as allowed by law, the company pays 
G-PAC administration costs. All G-PAC
transactions are publicly disclosed
via reports available on the Federal
Election Commission website
