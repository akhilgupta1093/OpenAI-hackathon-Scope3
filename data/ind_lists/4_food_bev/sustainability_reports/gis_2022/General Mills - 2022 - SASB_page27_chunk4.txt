Cocoa: More than 90% of our cocoa 
supply comes from West Africa, and 96% 
of our global supply comes from three 
key suppliers — Barry Callebaut, Cargill, 
and Olam. We work closely with NGO 
and supplier partners on the ground in 
Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire and invest to 
scale sustainable sourcing programs with 
a focus on strengthening smallholder 
farmer livelihoods, empowering women, 
and improving ingredient quality. In 
2021, over 90% of our cocoa volumes 
were covered by these programs
