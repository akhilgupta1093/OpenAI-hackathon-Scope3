CEO. The Global Responsible Sourcing 
program has a dedicated team and is 
part of our Global Sourcing Operations 
and Capabilities (GSOC) group. GSOC 
reports to the Chief Procurement 
Officer and is focused on integrating 
key capabilities into Sourcing processes 
for General Mills globally. Responsible 
sourcing is integrated into our Source 
to Pay process, the workflow utilized 
by the Global Sourcing organization. 
In fiscal 2021, we further advanced 
our program in the following ways:
n   Shifted management of our Global 
Responsible Sourcing program 
from a third party to in-house 
n   During the bidding process, began 
requiring all suppliers to upload a responsible sourcing audit and 
corrective action plan if one has been 
conducted in the last three years 
n   Piloted addition of responsible sourcing 
metrics to co-packer scorecards, along -
side commercial metrics such as on-
time delivery and price competitiveness 
n   Expanded program to include Tier 1 
supplier locations globally, including 
Blue Buffalo in our Pet segment, 
supported by internal data systems
n   Leveraged holistic risk elements (such 
as financial, ethics and compliance, 
human rights and cyber) through the 
Global Supply Risk Center of Excellence 
(COE) to provide a more complete 
picture of supplier business practices n   Assisted in the launch of an internal 
dashboard that allows buyers to 
easily access internal risk scores 
of all General Mills suppliers
n   Launched the use of virtual audits 
as needed due to COVID-19
n   Piloted a new Risk Escalation and Reso -
lution process that incorporates Global 
Responsible Sourcing program critical 
findings and also investigates human 
rights concerns outside of audit data 
(learn more in our Human rights section)
n   Began requiring buyer risk resolution 
plans to be submitted and approved 
by the sourcing leadership team 
as part of the escalation processn   Launched a root-cause-analysis 
process with our suppliers to provide 
more robust corrective action plans
n   Began incorporating media alerts 
into our risk identification process
n   Partnered with the sustainability 
team to pull environmental data from 
our audits to help measure progress 
against our sustainability goalsAt the start of the COVID-19 
pandemic, General Mills wanted 
to ensure the health and safety of 
workers at all levels in our supply 
chain. We broadly shared a list of 
best practices and guidelines with 
our suppliers on how General Mills 
was approaching COVID-19 safety 
protocols in our own facilities. Our 
Sourcing and Quality teams came 
together to host a food safety 
webinar that was available to all 
external manufacturing sites and 
direct suppliers. The webinar was 
created to share human and food 
safety best practices in light of the 
changes that COVID-19 brought to 
our manufacturing operations. We 
began to work in new and different 
ways, such as allowing for virtual 
audits and product startups so 
we could continue working in a 
safe and productive environment. 
Finally, we implemented a supplier 
appreciation and recognition 
program to show our gratitude 
and support to our suppliers who 
were working through a situation 
that was changing day by day.Partnering with  
our suppliers to 
address COVID-19
