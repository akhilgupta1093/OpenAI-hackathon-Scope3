What is food 
recovery?Resources saved by recovering food
Also known as food rescue, 
food recovery is the practice of 
intercepting or gleaning good 
surplus food that would otherwise 
go to waste from places such 
as restaurants, grocery stores, 
produce markets, or dining 
facilities and distributing it to 
local emergency food programs.Food recovery reduces GHG emissions and conserves natural resources. General Mills donated 49 million pounds of food in fiscal 2021. Based on 
the ReFED Insights Engine Impact Calculator (see next page), the impact of keeping that food out of landfills is equivalent to 1,925 passenger 
vehicles driven for 1 year. Learn more in the Planet section of this report
