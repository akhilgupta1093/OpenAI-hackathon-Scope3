General Mills philanthropy ties  
closely to our company’s purpose, 
core business and food systems 
knowledge. We partner in innovative 
ways with nonprofits and other partners 
to grow our collective impact in 
targeted issue areas, while engaging 
employees through volunteerism. 
Leadership and governance: General 
Mills philanthropy and community 
engagement programs are led by the 
Chief Sustainability and Global Impact 
Officer with support from a team of 
experienced specialists who steward 
the company’s philanthropy. In addition, 
employee councils located across our 
key global operating communities —  
General Mills “hometowns” — help 
to inform our local grant-making 
by recommending nonprofits 
to be considered for grants. 
General Mills philanthropy is governed 
by the Global Impact Governance 
Committee , which includes the 
company’s Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer and leaders from law, 
finance, R&D, supply chain, marketing, 
strategy and growth, communications 
and innovation functions. Global focus areas:
Alleviating hunger – feeding those in 
need, promoting surplus food 
recovery and addressing racial 
disparities in food access
