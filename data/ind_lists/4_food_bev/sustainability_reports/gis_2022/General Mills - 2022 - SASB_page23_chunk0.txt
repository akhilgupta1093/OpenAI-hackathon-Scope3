At General Mills, our business depends 
on the health and resilience of our 
planet and its natural resources. We 
take the outputs of Mother Nature and 
turn them into great tasting products 
that help feed people around the world. 
But we are experiencing increased 
frequency, intensity and duration of 
extreme weather events that affect 
global food security and impact our 
ability to deliver quality products to 
our consumers. We need to take action 
now to help maintain planetary health
