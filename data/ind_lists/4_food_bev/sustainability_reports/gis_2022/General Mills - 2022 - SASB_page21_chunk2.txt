But we have a lot of work to do. Changes 
in agriculture take time, especially as weâ€™re 
building a program that is grounded in 
measurable outcomes and new science 
and technology. For the first time in many 
years, our greenhouse gas emissions actually 
increased in fiscal 2021 as our company 
produced more food in order to help feed 
the world during the global pandemic. We 
will need the help of our partners, both 
upstream and downstream, to advance our 
progress as our company cannot do it alone
