We are committed to gender equality  
in the workplace, including pay equity. 
In partnership with external experts, 
we regularly conduct thorough pay 
equity reviews to ensure equitable 
pay outcomes for each job group. As 
a result of this work, we are assured 
that our pay systems and practices are generally fair and equitable among all 
employees (+/- 2% of 100%) without 
regard to gender, race or ethnicity
