Employee engagement, development and training
Our ability to make food the world loves 
is driven by our strategy of engaging 
people in a culture of learning, growing 
and belonging. 
Employee 
engagement
Our approach: We know that  
engaged employees create value and drive business performance. 
We continually work to build a 
more agile, engaged organization 
by listening to employees, taking 
action and measuring progress. 
We survey employees annually to 
measure five drivers of employee 
engagement: proud of my company, 
inspired by my leaders, connected to my team, supported by my manager 
and energized by my work. 
In fiscal 2021, we continued to create 
more frequent opportunities for 
listening to our employees as we 
navigated remote work dynamics.
