We also work to reduce food waste 
in our office buildings. At our 
headquarters, 89% of total waste was 
recycled and 0.58% went to landfill. We actively participate in industry, nonprofit 
and government groups focused on food 
loss and waste reduction as well as surplus 
food recovery, including AMERIPEN, the 
Food Waste Reduction Alliance, the 
Consumer Brands Association, ReFED, 
Consumer Goods Forum Food Waste 
Coalition of Action, MBOLD, and the U.S. 
Food Waste and Loss 2030 Champions
