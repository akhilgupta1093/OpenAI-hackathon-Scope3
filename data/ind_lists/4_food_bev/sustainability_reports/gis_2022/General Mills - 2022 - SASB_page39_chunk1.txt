Audits: We expect all suppliers to 
uphold our Supplier Code of Conduct, 
and we use responsible sourcing audits 
to assess and understand suppliersâ€™ 
business practices. These audits, which follow the Sedex Members Ethical 
Trade Audit (SMETA) protocol, are 
distinct from food safety audits. The 
SMETA framework is widely recognized 
by companies across many sectors, 
which enables suppliers to share audit 
results with multiple customers to 
improve efficiency and reduce audit 
burden. Accredited third-party auditors 
perform these audits and ensure 
timely creation of corrective action 
plans and closure of noncompliances 
identified within a specified time 
frame. Due to the challenges of 
COVID-19, General Mills is accepting 
virtual SMETA audits in regions where 
physical audits are not permitted
