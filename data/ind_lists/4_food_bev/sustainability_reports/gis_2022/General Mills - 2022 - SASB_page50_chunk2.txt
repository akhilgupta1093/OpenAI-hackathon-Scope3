Through our partnership with our corporate peers, local and state government, community leaders and others, we are taking bold 
and leading actions needed to combat racism and social inequality and ensure our community is a place where all can flourish.  
We are proud to be a founding member of the Minnesota Business Coalition for Racial Equity to create sustainable and meaningful 
change around racial and social justice for Black Minnesotans. Learn more in the Community section of this report
