Greenhouse gas emissions: Greenhouse 
gas emissions from operations 
decreased by 30%* in 2021 compared 
to our 2020 baseline, primarily due 
to our ongoing progress in energy 
efficiency, consolidation of operations 
and application of renewable energy 
certificates (RECs) from our wind  
power agreement and purchases  of Guarantees of Origins (GOs) in  
Europe (see details in the Appendix). 
Energy use: During fiscal 2021, the 
energy usage rate at our production 
facilities decreased by 2% compared 
to the prior year, as efficiency 
improvements offset higher production 
of energy-intensive products. 
We identify and implement improvements 
through our Five-Step Energy Reduction 
Process (see graphic), by working 
with our manufacturing plants to 
establish energy programs, conduct 
energy analyses, develop and execute 
improvement plans, and validate results. 
This process historically focused on 
facilities with significant spending on 
energy. We have recently evolved it to 
include all General Mills manufacturing 
facilities, by focusing improvement efforts on common systems such as compressed 
air, lighting and steam/hot water
