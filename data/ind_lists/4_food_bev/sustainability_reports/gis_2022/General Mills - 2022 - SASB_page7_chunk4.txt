n      Delivering nutrition: We work to 
advance nutrition priorities, including 
support for strong Dietary Guidelines 
for Americans, the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration’s (USDA) efforts to 
reflect the newest scientific information 
on the definition of “healthy,” strong 
U.S. school nutrition standards, and the 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants and Children (WIC). 
n    Ensuring safe food: We strongly 
support the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and 
its goal of raising food safety 
standards across the food value 
chain. We have consistently called 
on Congress to continue adequate 
funding for FSMA implementation
