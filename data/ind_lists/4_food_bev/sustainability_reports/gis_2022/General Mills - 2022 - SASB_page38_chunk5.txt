Waste reduction: We also work to 
decrease waste, which saves money 
and materials and decreases our overall 
GHG emissions. In fiscal 2021, the solid 
waste generation rate at our owned 
production facilities decreased by 
1%. During the year, 62% of our total 
production solid waste globally was recycled, 26% was processed for energy 
recovery and 12% was disposed.*
Worldwide, at the end of fiscal 2021, 
11 General Mills production facilities 
(28% of the global total) met our zero 
waste-to-landfill criteria.** This changed 
from the previous year due to plant 
closures. We continue working to 
reach our target of 100% by 2025
