We have also long committed to refrain 
from marketing food to children in 
schools or at school events — and this 
commitment applies to all schools, 
even middle schools and high schools. 
This commitment covers all forms of 
marketing (beyond the identification of 
the brand and product on menus and 
packaging). For example, we do not 
depict or display food brands, products 
or logos on posters, signs, scoreboards 
or school equipment, nor do we 
market foods by distributing product 
samples or branded merchandise in 
schools. There are no exceptions to this 
commitment. In the U.S., we operate 
the Box Tops for Education™ school 
fundraising program which, through 
sales of our products and those of many 
other companies (primarily nonfood 
companies), has provided close to US$1 
billion to schools since the program’s 
inception in 1996. Though schools are the beneficiaries of this program, we 
refrain from marketing the program 
to school children (whether inside or 
outside the school environment)
