Pesticide use: We recognize that 
some consumers and stakeholders have concerns about the use of pesticides. General Mills maintains a comprehensive system of controls and processes to ensure the highest level of product quality and safety. We also work to reduce the need for synthetic pesticides in agriculture. We detail our work in this area on our comprehensive Pesticide, food safety 
and ecosystems health web page
