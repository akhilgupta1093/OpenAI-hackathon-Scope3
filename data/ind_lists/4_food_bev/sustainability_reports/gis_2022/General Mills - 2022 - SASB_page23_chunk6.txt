Looking ahead: Recognizing the need 
to accelerate our progress in reducing 
emissions, General Mills is working to 
advance our internal carbon focus from 
footprint accounting to decarbonization 
strategies and execution. We are starting 
to staff internal teams to build internal 
glidepaths for carbon reduction and 
investing in external support to bring 
in capabilities of carbon abatement, 
quantification, and training. We also have 
work in process to begin engaging with 
suppliers in key categories to encourage 
them on their decarbonization journey, 
including setting targets and developing 
carbon abatement strategies.Climate change

*Consistent with Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) guidelines, our goal focuses on the categories of GHG emissions that are the most impactful and actionable for General Mills (approximately 77% of our total value chain footprint in 
FY21). It excludes emissions such as low-volume ingredients, capital goods, employee commuting, franchises, downstream warehouse and storage at retail, consumer trips to store and end of life (consumer food waste).GHG emissions: goal and progress
