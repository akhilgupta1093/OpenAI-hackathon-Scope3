Based on this assessment, we 
identified 10 priority watersheds as 
the most material and at-risk (see 
map). Within these watersheds, 
we consider two types of risks:
Acute risks are tied to specific 
locations, where we are focused 
on risk mitigation by supporting 
key NGO partners implementing 
watershed health strategies. 
Widespread/diffuse risks are 
broader in geographic scope and 
not easily traceable to specific organizations. To help address these, 
we pursue holistic approaches such 
as regenerative agriculture pilots
