r Our leadership in piloting groundbreaking technology is advancing the industry’s understanding and measurement of regenerative 
agriculture impacts.Riani (Ray) Lourens grew up on a 
farm in South Africa before relocating 
to a remote farming community in 
Saskatchewan, Canada. Her family’s 
operation is part of the General 
Mills Northern Plains Regenerative 
Agriculture Pilot program which 
kicked off in 2019. Ray has been 
working with Understanding Ag to 
implement regenerative management 
techniques on the majority of the 
farms’ managed acres, specifically 
incorporating livestock, nutrient 
cycling and reducing inputs. 
After the first year of participation, 
Ray’s expertise and leadership was 
recognized by Understanding Ag. As 
a result, she was invited to serve as 
a field consultant for Understanding 
Ag and work with other pilot farmers 
in addition to continuing as a pilot 
participant. Ray also helps with 
overall program administration and 
farm data collection to document 
the impact of regenerative 
management on ecosystem functions 
and farm/community resilience.Farmer spotlight
“The best part about being in a project 
like this is the opportunity to meet 
other farmers who are like-minded and 
share thoughts and ideas. With our 
short growing season, we have unique 
challenges and have to find ways to 
incorporate the principles of soil health 
in context to our environment and 
individual operations.” — Ray Lourens
