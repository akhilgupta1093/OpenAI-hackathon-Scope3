Disaster relief: When disaster strikes 
in the communities where we operate, 
General Mills is ready to contribute 
in ways that provide relief and help 
communities recover. Through financial 
grants and General Mills food donations, 
we help to ensure that our humanitarian 
and disaster relief partners are resourced 
and equipped to help communities 
during their most urgent times of need
