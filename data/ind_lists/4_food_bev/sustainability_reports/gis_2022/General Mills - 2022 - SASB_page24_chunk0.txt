As agriculture drives our 
largest climate impact, 
we must adapt farming 
practices to reduce  
land-based emissions.Drive emission 
reductions across 
all aspects of dairy 
operations and value 
chains, including  
animal feed, enteric 
emissions, manure, and  
on-farm energy.Advance work to 
eliminate deforestation 
in supply chains 
across select high-risk 
ingredient categories.Achieve energy usage 
reductions and identify 
efficiency opportunities 
at General Mills owned 
production facilities.Source renewable 
electricity for 100% of 
General Mills owned 
operations globally and 
evaluate external supply 
chain opportunities.Work with transport 
carriers to leverage 
more GHG-efficient 
equipment, shift to lower-
GHG transport modes, 
optimize truck fill rates 
and reduce empty miles.Optimize manufacturing 
processes to reduce 
waste of ingredients, 
limiting agricultural 
emissions and waste.Our goals for 2030 and 2050 are aggressive, but needed, to achieve a stable climate. In order for General Mills to hit these targets, we need to collaborate across our value chain and 
drive systemic change. We have developed a multipronged strategy to enable General Mills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
