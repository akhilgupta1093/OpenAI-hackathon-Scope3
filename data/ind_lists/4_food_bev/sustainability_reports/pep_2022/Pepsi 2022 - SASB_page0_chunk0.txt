This report marks the second time PepsiCo has reported in alignment with the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards. We have reported the disclosures related to the two 
sectors that are most closely aligned to our business: Processed Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages. 
In certain instances, and as noted throughout this index, a specific SASB topic may be discussed 
generally in our ESG Report but we do not report on the corresponding SASB metric. In addition, certain 
disclosures may not be fully aligned with SASBâ€™s definition, but represent the closest approximation 
possible. Unless otherwise noted, our sustainability data reflects progress made during the calendar 
year (ending December 31), whereas our financial reporting corresponds with our fiscal year, which 
varies slightly from year-to-year. We are constantly evaluating our goals and progress, assessing the 
technical and regulatory challenges we face in achieving our ambitious objectives, and innovating new 
ways to keep moving forward, which may impact goals referenced in this index. Inclusion of information 
in this index should not be construed as a characterization of the materiality or financial impact of 
that information. Please see our Form 10-K for the financial year ended December 25, 2021 and other 
publicly-filed documents, which are available at www.pepsico.com/investors/investor-relations.PepsiCo
