Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 
physically-certified palm oil and 100% 
Bonsucro certified sustainable cane 
sugar globally.1
Approximately 50% of our key 
ingredients were sustainably-sourced, 
including more than 90% of grower-
sourced crops. For grower-sourced 
crops, sustainable sourcing refers to 
meeting the independently verified 
environmental, social and economic 
principles of PepsiCo’s Sustainable 
Farming Program (SFP). For supplier-
sourced crops, sustainable sourcing 
is achieved through a third party 
standard that has been benchmarked 
as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited 
regions, a continuous improvement 
program addressing the main 
environmental and social risks with 
growing the relevant crop.ESG Topics A-Z: Agriculture

FB-NB-430a.1Reported Quantitative RateIn 2021, more than 900 on-site audits 
or virtual assessments were conducted 
with first-tier suppliers using the 
industry standard SMETA 4-Pillar Audit 
Protocol or an equivalent assessment. 
Among our Tier 1 strategic suppliers in 
2021, the non-conformance rate for 
suppliers with highest risk — red audit 
results — was just over 8% of our total 
assessments. ESG Topics A-Z:  Sustainable
