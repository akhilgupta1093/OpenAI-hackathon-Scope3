analysisTo help provide nutrition guidance 
during the development of our 
beverages and foods, and diversify our 
product portfolio in the process, we 
deploy the PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria 
(PNC). These science-based criteria 
are based on recommendations 
for food and nutrient intake from 
leading global and national nutrition 
authorities including the World Health 
Organization, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, the National Academy of 
Medicine, and national public health 
authorities. The PNC set standards for 
nutrients to limit as well as nutrients 
and food groups to encourage that 
are based on the latest science and 
country specific dietary guidelines.
