analysisIt is our policy for suppliers of 
ingredients to achieve certification to 
a GFSI recognized standard, including 
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) 
for agricultural commodities, or to 
demonstrate equivalence through a 
PepsiCo pre-approval audit scheme. 
We continue to work with suppliers 
to increase the proportion of GFSI

food safety standards. We use qualified 
ingredients, approved suppliers and 
follow all applicable regulations issued 
by regulatory authorities. Our products 
are traceable, which enables us to 
quickly investigate and address any 
potential concerns in the marketplace. 
Our facilities conduct mock recalls 
on at least an annual basis to ensure 
readiness to respond to any incident.

occur, we take quick action, conduct 
robust investigations, implement 
corrective actions and share learnings
