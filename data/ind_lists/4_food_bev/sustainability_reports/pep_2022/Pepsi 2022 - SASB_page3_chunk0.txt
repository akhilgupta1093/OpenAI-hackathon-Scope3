discussionPepsiCo ensures that products 
containing bioengineered materials 
comply with local regulations for 
their use, including any labeling 
requirements. We want consumers to 
have clear and helpful information 
about their foods and beverages and 
believe that any labeling standards 
established in this regard should 
be clear and consistent so that 
consumers can better understand 
the safety, prevalence, and benefits 
of bioengineered ingredients and can 
make informed choices for themselves 
and their families.

bioengineered ingredients or labeled
