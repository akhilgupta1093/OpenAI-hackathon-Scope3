Times of great change also represent great opportunity. Our 2021 ESG Report – where we reflect on 
what we as a Company achieved over the past year, along with the progress we still need to make – 
serves as a testament to our approximately 38,000 global employees who went above and beyond to 
support our communities and each other during 2020. If the past year taught us anything, it is that we 
are all connected. We all feel the impact of each other’s actions and inactions – whether as a result of a 
global pandemic, systemic racial injustice, or environmental change. 
Looking ahead, we are committed to holding ourselves to a higher standard, stepping up to the plate 
to boldly address the challenges that lie ahead. We invite all of our stakeholders to join us on this 
journey to help transform the future
