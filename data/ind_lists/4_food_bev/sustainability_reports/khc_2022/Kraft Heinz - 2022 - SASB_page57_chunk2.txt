In the U.K., Kraft Heinz participates in the On-Pack Recycling Label 
(OPRL) program, which delivers simple recycling messaging on 
retailer and brand packaging to help consumers recycle more 
accurately and more often. The OPRL label appears on several 
Kraft Heinz products in the region, including Heinz Beanz , Heinz 
Spaghetti  and Heinz Soup  products.Flexible Packaging Recycled into Roofing 
Material 
In 2020, Kraft Heinz completed a pilot project to demonstrate the 
use of roof board made from recycled flexible packaging. The test 
was made possible by the Company’s participation in Materials 
Recovery For the Future  (MRFF), a non-profit research collaborative 
that set out to determine the technical and economic feasibility to 
collect, sort, bale and recycle flexible plastic packaging. 
The project installed roofing material made from post-consumer 
flexible plastic into two Kraft Heinz manufacturing plants, in Beaver 
Dam, Wisconsin and in Holland, Michigan. The materials were 
installed late in the year and comprised of 4’ X 8’ boards, with 94 
percent of each board made of post-consumer recycled plastic and 
fiber.

58“This Kraft Heinz project is a powerful example of environmental 
stewardship, reducing use of virgin materials by choosing roofing material 
made of recycled flexible plastic packaging. Working with recyclers, 
they’ve provided a model for addressing expectations for full life-cycle 
management of plastic while using an efficient, low-cost package for 
consumer product protection.”
