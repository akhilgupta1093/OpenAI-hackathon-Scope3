• Launching a new Supplier Diversity Program for businesses that 
are majority-owned by people of color, women, those in the 
LGBTQI+ community, people with disabilities, and veterans. 
The Program will help these businesses gain access to essential 
skills, tools, and networks – giving them the opportunity to 
become Kraft Heinz suppliers. We report annually on our ESG progress, and this Report serves 
as our Communication on Progress as part of our commitments 
to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the UNGC’s 
CEO Water Mandate. I invite you to visit our ESG website  – which 
includes videos highlighting our ESG and Diversity, Inclusion, and 
Belonging achievements, aspirations, and commitments – and read 
this Report, detailing how we are working hard to bring these goals 
to life.  
We believe in using our size, scale, and agility to drive real and 
positive change inside and outside the walls of Kraft Heinz – all to 
achieve our Company Vision “To sustainably grow by delighting 
more consumers globally.” 
That’s what stepping up to the plate is all about.
