Building off of that initial engagement, Kraft Heinz Pantry Day 
was established (pictured above). Pantry Day encourages 
Canadians to join the fight against food insecurity by 
purchasing a participating Kraft Heinz product at their local 
grocery store, which is then matched with a similar food 
donation to Food Banks Canada.  
Project Pantry and Pantry Day are part of Kraft Heinz Canada’s 
5-year, $20-million product donation commitment that will help 
bring meals to the tables of the 4.4 million Canadians affected 
by food insecurity. Kraft Heinz Project Pantry and Pantry Day 
mark another chapter in Kraft Heinz Canada’s long history of 
supporting food banks across the country. 
“We are thankful to have found a great long-term partner in 
Kraft Heinz Canada,” says Chris Hatch, Chief Executive Officer, 
Food Banks Canada. “The Kraft Heinz Pantry Day commitment 
makes them our largest consumer packaged goods supporter 
and this donation will go a long way in helping us to deliver vital 
food aid to Canadians in need.”Partnership with Babytree
The Kraft Heinz Company partnered with 
Babytree, one of the largest parenting websites 
in China, to donate more than 4,000 boxes 
of Heinz  infant food to families in need 
through the Shanghai Fosun Foundation. 
The Company’s products were delivered to 25 
hospitals in five Chinese provinces most severely 
affected by the outbreak including Hubei, Hunan, 
Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Henan. 
 
Feeding America  
Kraft Heinz also pledged $1.9 million in cash to Feeding 
America®, the largest domestic hunger relief organization 
in the United States, to help support food banks located 
in and near places where the Company has offices and 
plants, such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository and 
the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Feeding 
America’s COVID-19 Response Fund helps food banks across 
the country as they support communities impacted by the 
pandemic, enabling them to secure the resources they need to 
efficiently serve some of the most vulnerable people
