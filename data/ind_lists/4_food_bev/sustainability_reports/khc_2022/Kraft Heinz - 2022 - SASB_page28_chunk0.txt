29The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation (Kraft Heinz Foundation) pursues its 
mission through strategic partnerships with organizations that have programs 
aligned with hunger relief, nutrition support and self-sustaining food sources. 
Kraft Heinz employees from all corners of the world have passionately joined 
the Foundation through volunteer efforts towards our goals, highlighting the 
critical nature and immediacy of our work in alleviating world hunger. 
We are proud of the progress we’ve made upon our original goal to deliver 1 billion nutritious meals to those in need by 2021. At the end of 
2020, through a combination of financial support and product donations, we have delivered more than 745 million meals to those in need 
since 2016. We have put our foot on the accelerator, and in 2020 we provided more than 206 million meals to people in need. Our current 
total for 2019-2020 has now broached 345 million meals to those in need toward our new 1.5 billion meal target by 2025 – we’re 23 
percent of the way there. Working to Alleviate  
Global Hunger
We have aligned our current key partners towards this goal:
The Kraft Heinz  
Micronutrient 
Campaign
The Kraft Heinz 
Micronutrient Campaign, established by the H.J. Heinz 
Holding Corporation in 2001, aims to use the skills and 
compassion of our employees to develop a nutritional 
supplement to promote healthy growth and development 
of those in hunger in developing regions around the 
world. 
Understanding that nutrition and food are pivotal in the 
growth and success of a child, and especially significant 
for malnourished children across the globe, Kraft Heinz 
created this micronutrient sachet with essential vitamins 
and minerals, to be mixed in with more readily available 
food without all these benefits
