Eliminate Painful Procedures
We are working with farmers and the industry to develop and adopt 
practical alternatives that eliminate painful procedures. When painful 
procedures need to be performed, we encourage pain mitigation, 
such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. We expect our suppliers to 
adhere to industry guidelines, which were developed to provide safe, 
quality products while keeping both animals and humans safe
