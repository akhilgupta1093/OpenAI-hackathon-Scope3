Our food safety and product quality management process has 
been designed by us for us. We utilize leading methodologies to 
ensure food is manufactured safely, complies with local regulations 
and meets or exceeds the quality standards weâ€™ve set for our 
products. Compliance with our own internal food safety and product quality 
management system ensures our internal factories are also 
compliant with Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized 
certification (e.g. FSSC 22000). Many of our factories undergo third 
party audits and achieve third party certification to demonstrate 
this. In addition to complying with our internal food safety and 
product quality management system, we also monitor other 
external metrics including product recall, serious incidents and 
factory related consumer complaints.
