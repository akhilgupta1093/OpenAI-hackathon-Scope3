Animal Welfare Risk Assessments
Annually, all U.S.-based Kraft Heinz suppliers of animal and animal-derived products are required to complete an animal welfare risk assessment. The assessment was 
developed by a cross-functional internal panel that included animal welfare, procurement and quality team members and was reviewed by an external team of animal 
welfare scientists. The assessments review suppliers’ strengths and weaknesses on animal welfare policies, personnel training, transportation, stunning methods and 
auditing. Kraft Heinz’s animal welfare team works with lower performing suppliers, which make up a small percentage of our total supply chain. Together, they create 
action plans to develop policies and procedures that improve animal welfare. Low performing suppliers unwilling or unable to improve animal welfare may jeopardize 
their status as Kraft Heinz suppliers. In 2020, we expanded assessment requirements to all suppliers globally for the first time
