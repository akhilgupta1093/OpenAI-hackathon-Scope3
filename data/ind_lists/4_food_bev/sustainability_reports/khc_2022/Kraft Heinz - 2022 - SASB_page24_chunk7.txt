Our Value, We demand diversity , continues to guide our efforts 
across our global footprint and our employees are excited for the 
opportunity to bring this value to life in new ways. The increase 
in BRG participation is one of many powerful indicators that our 
employees are engaged in our diversity, inclusion, and belonging 
efforts. As a global organization, we are looking forward to 
continuing to create a diverse environment where all employees 
feel included, recognized, and supported, with a sense of 
belonging at Kraft Heinz.
