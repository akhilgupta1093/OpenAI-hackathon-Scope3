NOVA GOIAS, BRAZIL
Getting More out of Mayo 
Our Nova Goias facility in Brazil is a key producer of Heinz  and Quero  
mayonnaise for the region. In 2020, the site created a way to capture 
and divert unsaleable product to a third-party facility for beneficial reuse. 
At this facility, the mayonnaise is processed to extract the oil from its 
contents and then turned into biodiesel. Any leftover residue is also used 
to produce animal feed. As a result, the site successfully reduced waste 
by approximately nine percent year over year. In the future, we anticipate 
expanding this program to include different product lines and further divert 
waste from the landfill
