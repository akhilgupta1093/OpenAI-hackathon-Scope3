Waste Reduction
At Kraft Heinz, we think about waste holistically. To source, produce 
and package food and beverage products requires several inputs 
and outputs related to ingredients and byproducts, material flows 
and end-of-life package considerations. When we think about 
materials and food-related flows, detailed waste evaluations help 
us identify where we can ‘reduce, repurpose and recycle.’ In fact, 
our global owned manufacturing sites divert more than 90 percent 
of our solid waste to recycling or byproducts usage. We look 
forward to increasing diversion from landfill for the remaining less 
than 10 percent. 
As of December 31, 2020, about 10 percent of Kraft Heinz global 
manufacturing facilities had achieved zero-waste-to-landfill 
status. We’re working to achieve zero-waste at additional sites by 
standardizing, replicating and rolling out these best practices as 
broadly as possible across our network in partnership with third-
party service providers.  
We are committed to finding creative solutions to reduce waste 
bound for the landfill. Much of our organic waste or byproducts, 
for example, can be used as animal feed, fertilizer or processed 
to generate fuels. Our cardboard and plastic waste can also be 
repurposed to produce new products. For our most challenging 
waste categories, we are actively looking into developments 
around pyrolises and other innovative ways of recycling
