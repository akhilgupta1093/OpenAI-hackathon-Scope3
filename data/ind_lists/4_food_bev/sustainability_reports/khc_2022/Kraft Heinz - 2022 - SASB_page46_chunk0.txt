ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP
RESPONSIBLE SOURCING
INTRODUCTION
HEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORT
APPENDIXAt Kraft Heinz, environmental stewardship begins with our operational 
footprint, where we actively strive to conserve water and energy, reduce 
emissions, minimize waste and make our packaging sustainable. From 
there it extends to initiatives in our supply chain and takes shape as 
collaborative projects with customers at the other end of the spectrum. 
Notwithstanding, our manufacturing sites can consume substantial 
amounts of resources, and are controlled by us, so we focus significant 
efforts around environmental stewardship inside of our walls.Environmental
