Kraft Heinz Management System
In 2020, we consolidated the Kraft Heinz 
Management System (KHMS) program across 
our global manufacturing operations. These 
practices are based on our Company’s Values 
and are reflected in our daily routines. Each 
component of the KHMS framework has a 
function that drives excellence in different areas 
of the organization. For example, as part of the 
‘Employee & Environmental Health’ and the 
‘Maintenance, Reliability & Engineering’ pillars, we have developed clear 
procedures that focus on the management of our utilities and waste practices. 
These processes establish the program’s ownership and accountability matrix, 
define the functions that need to be engaged in the platform, along with 
routines, best practices, KPIs and targets. They also include detailed guidance 
on how to drive improvement in these areas via the implementation of what 
we call Good Operational Practices (GOPs). This framework is an essential part 
of driving progress towards our global ESG commitments in real time. Since 
adopting this framework, we have made significant positive progress toward our 
ESG commitments. 
Our KHMS GOPs include areas such as:
•  Boiler efficiency and performance
•  Management of air compressor systems
•  Efficiency and operation of chillers
•  Heat recovery
•  LED Lighting 
•  Replacement of low efficiency equipment
•  Assets accessibility, capacity and functional optimization
•  Waste and recycling process, byproducts streams and optimization 525252Energy Use
