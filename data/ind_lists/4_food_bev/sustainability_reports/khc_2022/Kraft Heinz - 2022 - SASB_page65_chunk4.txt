Humane Endings
We believe animals should be provided a respectful and humane 
death. Compromised animals must be euthanized in a timely manner 
that aligns with the American Veterinary Medical Association  (AVMA) 
or World Organisation for Animal Healthâ€™s  (OIE) guidelines. Similarly, 
slaughter should also align with these guidelines. Efficient stunning 
prior to slaughter is important for animal welfare. One hundred percent 
of our U.S. Oscar Mayer  product suppliers report that they comply with 
our product specifications which require an annual third-party humane 
slaughter audit and weekly internal animal welfare audits
