Community Support
We provided $1 million in financial support to social justice 
organizations and food-focused programs that supported 
communities hardest hit by social inequities in 2020. Those 
organizations included the United Negro College Fund, My 
Block My Hood My City, Second Harvest Heartland Food Bank, 
and 412 Food Rescue, among others. Employee Development
To further the development of our Black employees, in 
2020 we launched a Black BRG Mentoring Program and 
the WeLead Accelerator Program. WeLead was designed 
to drive accelerated career growth for our Black employees 
and those who identify as two or more races at the individual 
contributor level. During this five-month immersive program, 
36 participants in the first cohort learned critical business and 
communication skills, built connections, and activated our 
Values through our leadership principles. WeLead is now an 
ongoing, annual program. Participants in this program now 
include employees of color from throughout the U.S
