Water Use  
& Conservation
Water is fundamental to all life and business either directly or indirectly. Making high-quality products requires that we begin with 
high-quality ingredients of which fresh quality water is a key input. Kraft Heinz is committed to water stewardship in every facet of our 
business, from our quality controls to the relationships we have with our growers and suppliers. As a food and beverage company, 
having access to sufficient amounts of quality fresh water, both now and in the future, is critical to our business. Water is used in many 
areas of our value chain. It is a vital input for growing various agricultural ingredients we use in our products. We also use water as a 
direct ingredient in many of our products and as a key utility in our manufacturing, cleaning and sanitation processes. Access to high-
quality water is pivotal for us to achieve our high standards of food safety and quality. High-quality water will continue to be a vital 
component throughout our value chain.
