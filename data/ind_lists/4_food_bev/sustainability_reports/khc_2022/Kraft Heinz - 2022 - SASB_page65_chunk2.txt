Dairy Cattle
North America: We require our U.S. suppliers to follow the 
National Milk Producers Federation’s Farmers Assuring Responsible 
Management (FARM) Animal Care guidelines . This program 
establishes best on-farm animal management practices and includes 
second-party evaluations and third-party verification. Most of our dairy 
supply comes from U.S. farms. Our Canadian suppliers follow the 
National Farm Animal Care Council’s Code of Practice for the Care and 
Handling of Dairy Cattle. Third-party audits are required to ensure that 
the U.S. and Canadian programs’ guidelines are followed
