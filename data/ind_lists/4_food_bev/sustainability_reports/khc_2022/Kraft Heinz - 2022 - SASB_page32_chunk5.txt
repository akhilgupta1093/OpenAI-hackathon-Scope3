2020 was marked with a special fundraiser to support whānau and 
tamariki (children) across New Zealand. To celebrate this long-
lasting relationship, during our anniversary week in July 2020, 
Wattie’s  committed to donating a baby food pouch to Plunket for 
every Stage 1 and 2 Wattie’s  baby food pouch sold at Countdown 
and New World grocery stores in New Zealand. This resulted in 
approximately 50,000 pouches of baby food being donated to 
Plunket to help support whānau across New Zealand.
