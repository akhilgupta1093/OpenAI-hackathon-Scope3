Kraft Heinz continues to leverage innovation through science-support-evidence and clinical trials. 
Nutrimune, utilized in milk formula in Italy, offers a unique ingredient derived from a proprietary 
Lactobacillus paracasei strain that, pending completion of clinical studies, we believe can help support a 
healthy immune system in infants and young children
