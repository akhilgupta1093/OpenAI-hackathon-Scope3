Child Aid
In 2020, the Kraft Heinz Foundation awarded a $75,000 grant 
(approximately 579,600 meals) to support Guatemalan children 
and their families as part of Child Aid’s White Flag Hunger Relief 
Campaign. The spread of COVID-19 added additional challenges 
to a country already grappling with inflation and food insecurity 
issues. In addition, two powerful hurricanes hit the region in quick 
succession in November 2020, which further crippled a nation 
under siege. Families who normally teeter on the edge of extreme 
poverty found themselves, without immediate intervention, 
facing starvation. Through Child Aid, children and families in 
need received boxes of emergency food supplies to help them 
through these difficult times. Each box feeds a family of five or six 
people for approximately three weeks and contains one pound of 
beans, one pound of rice, one liter of oil, one pound of noodles, 
powdered milk, salt, sugar, hand sanitizer, vitamins for children, and 
one Spanish-language children’s storybook
