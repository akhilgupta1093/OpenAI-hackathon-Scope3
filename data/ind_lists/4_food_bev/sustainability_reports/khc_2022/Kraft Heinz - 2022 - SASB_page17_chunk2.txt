Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the factory produced approximately 3 
million boxes of Kraft  Dinner , five days per week. With our lines running 
24/7, we pumped out more than 4 million boxes daily. We continued this 
increased production schedule from March 2020 to the second quarter of 
2021. 
During this time, plant manager Danielle Nguyen was also committed 
to making sure that appropriate safety protocols were followed and that 
employees received the adequate rest time to avoid burn out. Employees 
prepared business continuity protocols to ensure continued production in 
the event anyone tested positive for COVID-19 or began showing symptoms
