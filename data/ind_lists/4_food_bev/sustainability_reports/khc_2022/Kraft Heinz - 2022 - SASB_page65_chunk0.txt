Laying Hens 
The ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting, 
and dust-bathing is important to laying hen welfare, which is why we 
support housing options such as cage-free housing with perches and 
nest boxes. In Europe, we achieved our commitment to exclusively 
purchase free-range eggs by the end of 2020. This represented a 
significant improvement year over year and was the result of many 
hard-working Kraft Heinz team membersâ€™ dedication to good animal 
welfare, business investment and alignment with our values as a good 
corporate citizen. Throughout the rest of the world, we are transitioning 
to purchasing only cage-free eggs or better (e.g., free-range) by 
2025. Having achieved our free-range egg commitment in Europe, 
we have now updated our reporting to grouping cage-free or better 
farm systems together in one universal metric, which we feel reflects 
a more comprehensive picture of the level of animal welfare we strive 
to achieve. Globally, our supply of eggs and products was 66 percent 
cage-free or better in 2020. For more details on our regional egg data,
