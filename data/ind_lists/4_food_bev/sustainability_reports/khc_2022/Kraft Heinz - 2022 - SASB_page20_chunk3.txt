Kraft Heinz also donated $1.5 million worth of products to impacted 
people in Australia and New Zealand, and 1 million servings of 
Lunchables  and Capri Sun  products to school children in the Dallas, 
Texas area. Kraft Heinz brands, including Heinz  ketchup and Oscar 
Mayer , have responded to the crisis in their own ways, expanding the 
companyâ€™s impact. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we continue to 
evaluate our response and adapt to ensure the health and safety of our 
employees, and support for impacted communities
