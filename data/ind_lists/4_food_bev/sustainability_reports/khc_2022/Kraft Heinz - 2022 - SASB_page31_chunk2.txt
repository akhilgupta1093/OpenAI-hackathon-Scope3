Pantry Day  
On October 16, 2020, World Food Day, Kraft Heinz Canada 
launched Pantry Day , encouraging Canadians to join the fight 
against food insecurity by purchasing a participating Kraft Heinz 
product at their local grocery store, which was then matched by 
Kraft Heinz with a donation to Food Banks Canada. Kraft Heinz 
Pantry Day supports Food Banks Canada with a 5-year, $20 
million product donation that will help bring meals to the tables 
of the 4.4 million Canadians affected by food insecurity across 
the country. The scope and donation effort of Kraft Heinz Pantry 
Day makes it the largest one-day donation matching event for 
Food Banks Canada. Supporting Communities in Need  (cont.)
