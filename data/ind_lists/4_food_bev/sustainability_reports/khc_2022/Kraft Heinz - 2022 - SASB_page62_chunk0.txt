INTRODUCTION
RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGSustainable Soy Sourcing
In partnership with The Rainforest Alliance, in 2019 Kraft Heinz 
expanded its forest risk commodities supply chain assessment 
to include soy. The first phase of this work focused on our global 
direct soy-based ingredient suppliers, with the purpose of carrying 
out a baseline evaluation to understand their sustainable soy 
sourcing policies and commitments. As part of that process, we 
evaluated any existing sustainable product certifications and 
sourcing risks based on countries of origin. We also established 
greater visibility to their overall chain of custody. 
Based on results obtained from our direct global suppliers that 
completed the survey, we learned the following about our global 
soy volume, approximately:
• 47 percent is sourced from low-risk countries of origin in regard 
to environmental and social risk
• 5 percent sourced from potential medium-risk countries of 
origin
• 38 percent sourced from potential high-risk countries of originAdditionally, 49 percent of the suppliers that participated in the 
exercise reported having a sustainable sourcing policy in place 
while 33 percent of the suppliers that indicated they do not have a 
policy in place, communicated they could develop and implement 
a policy in the future. This initial assessment helped us gain visibility 
into and increased transparency of a considerable portion of our 
global soy supply chain. Further engagement is needed in our soy 
value chain to investigate potential risks. The assessment produced 
a number of key recommendations that we are in the process of 
evaluating to help determine next steps
