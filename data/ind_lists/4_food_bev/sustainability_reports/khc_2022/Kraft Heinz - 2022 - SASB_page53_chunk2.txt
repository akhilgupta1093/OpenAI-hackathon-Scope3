For example, our Shanghai manufacturing facility found a novel 
way to divert waste from the landfill. A common byproduct of the 
wastewater treatment process at the site is a form of biological 
sludge. The facility produced approximately 250 – 300 tons of this 
sludge each year. Unfortunately, the sludge is not easily recyclable 
and comes with a high cost of disposal. The team then found a 
local earthworm-breeding company that could turn the biological 
sludge into organic fertilizer. The organic fertilizer is sold to farmers 
for usage in fruit and vegetable farms. Through this program, the 
site significantly reduced their waste to landfill while reducing 
overall waste costs by up to 40 percent. 
Reduce waste to landfill intensity  by 20%  across our 
manufacturing facilities by 2025  (per metric ton of product made).
