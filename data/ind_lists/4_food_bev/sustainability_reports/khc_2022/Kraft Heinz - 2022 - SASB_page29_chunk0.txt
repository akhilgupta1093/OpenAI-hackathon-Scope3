3030Rise Against Hunger 
The Kraft Heinz Foundation has been a partner of Rise Against Hunger since its inception. Originating 
from the desire to provide nutritious and efficient meals to those facing hunger across the world, our 
partnership with Rise Against Hunger now impacts a wide variety of issues ranging from addressing 
global hunger from localized, urgent needs to wider systemic, long-term projects. Today, we are Rise 
Against Hunger’s largest partner. 
30“Rise Against Hunger impacts millions of lives each year, and we would not be able to do so without the  
dedicated support of Kraft Heinz. In 2020, as the world faced the pandemic’s unprecedented effects, our top priority  
was — and always will be — supporting the people we serve, working to alleviate hunger around the world. Rise Against Hunger 
served over 2.8 million people facing hunger in 41 countries last year. Our continued partnership with Kraft Heinz will allow us  
to impact more lives and continue the crucial fight to end global hunger.”
