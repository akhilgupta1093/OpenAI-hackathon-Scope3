Supplier Guiding Principles 
Kraft Heinz has developed a set of Global Principles applicable to 
its supply chain referred to as the Supplier Guiding Principles . In 
2020, Kraft Heinz set out on an ambitious path to update these 
Supplier Guiding Principles in accordance with our commitment 
for improved efficacy and due diligence with our valued suppliers 
around sustainable business practices. The Supplier Guiding 
Principles will apply to all suppliers and we have plans to include 
external manufacturers and joint venture partners in the near 
future. They ensure consistency across operations for upholding 
fundamental values and all applicable laws. They also require 
compliance with local labor, human rights and environmental 
standards. If requested, suppliers must certify their compliance 
and undergo audits to ensure they meet our Supplier Guiding 
Principles.

process to help shape public policies that impact our business

value chain, including employees, suppliers, customers, consumers 
and shareholders are fairly represented at all levels of government.
