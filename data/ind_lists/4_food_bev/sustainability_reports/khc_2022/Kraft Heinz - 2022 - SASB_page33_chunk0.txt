In countries where we live and work, Kraft Heinz stood up for social 
justice in many ways. For example, Kraft Heinz Canada became a 
signatory to the BlackNorth Initiativeâ€™s CEO Pledge  against anti-
black systemic racism. Canada Zone President, Bruno Keller signed 
the pledge in 2020 and Kraft Heinz Canada has been working 
towards actions and commitments across the various pledge 
components, including bias interruption training, partnering with 
local organizations like the Canadian Black Chamber of Commerce, 
and outreach to Black university student organizations
