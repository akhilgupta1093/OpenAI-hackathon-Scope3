RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGSustainable Agriculture
As a food and beverage company, we recognize 
the importance of sustainable agriculture in all of 
our products. Through the work of our experienced 
agronomists and procurement teams, we are proud 
to work with our suppliers to advance sustainable 
agriculture practices knowing that these commodities are integral to our business and to the well-being 
of our consumers and communities in which we operate. 
At Kraft Heinz, sustainable agriculture has been a history of working with growers to drive rotational crops to promote multigenerational 
fields, increase yield at the field and in processing, drive next generation breeding through our seed business and find ways to help 
increase water efficiency. 
Through thorough research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, we strive to stay at the forefront of 
sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn to additional parts of our business
