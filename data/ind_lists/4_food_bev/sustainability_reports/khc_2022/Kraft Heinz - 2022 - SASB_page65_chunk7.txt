Hormones
While studies conclude hormone supplements in cattle are safe for 
animals and for humans, we support ongoing research efforts to further 
demonstrate the safety and usefulness of supplemental hormones. For 
example, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is a hormone that can 
increase milk production in dairy cattle. Globally its usage varies widely 
in accordance with government regulations. In the United States for 
example, hormones (including rbST) are not allowed to be used for growth 
promotion in pigs or poultry for example. In some countries, growth 
hormones are approved for use in beef and dairy cattle. We do not restrict 
their use in those instances. However, we support wider, industry initiatives 
to eliminate rbST from the supply
