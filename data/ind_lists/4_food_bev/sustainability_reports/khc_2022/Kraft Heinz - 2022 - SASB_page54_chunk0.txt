Reducing Food Waste
Food waste is a global problem. Globally, 1.3 billion tons of food 
is wasted annually accounting for roughly one third of all food 
produced globally. That is approximately 2.2 trillion meals that 
could be feeding the almost 800 million hungry people around the 
world. Beyond this, food waste is detrimental to our environment, 
leading to wasted resources like energy, water and land. And as our 
population grows, the pressure on our water, land and energy to 
feed all those people will only increase
