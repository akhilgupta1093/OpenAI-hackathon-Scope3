Stepping up to the Plate: Kraft Heinz 2021 ESG Report                 2525Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging: Impact Across Our Global Footprint  (cont.) 
Recruiting  
We committed to strengthening our partnerships with Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities. As just one example, we partnered 
with Clark Atlanta University, through the CEO Academy, to work 
with over 100 junior and senior students on networking, LinkedIn 
best practices, and learning about a day in the life of a marketer. 
Kraft Heinz employees from across the organization participated 
in six class sessions throughout the winter 2020 term. We also 
partnered with Howard University, through its 21 Cap program. In 
this program, we worked with 25 students on a semester long case 
study. The winning team was awarded Kraft Heinz branded prizes 
and the top two students, voted on by their peers, were each 
awarded a $1,500 scholarship from Kraft Heinz. In Canada, we enhanced our inclusive recruitment processes to 
increase the diversity of our talent pools. We introduced blind 
resume reviews, bias interruption training, and scanning our job 
descriptions through a gender bias decoder. 
Like our BRGs in the U.S. and International Zones, our Canadian 
Diversity Committee shifted to a virtual environment which was 
instrumental in connecting employees throughout 2020. We 
celebrated cultural diversity through educational opportunities. 
Various events were held throughout the year including, 
International Womenâ€™s Day, Juneteenth, Orange Shirt Day, Day for 
People with Disabilities, and Pride Month
