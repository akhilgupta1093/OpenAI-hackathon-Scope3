Additionally, we focused on the communities in which we operate 
to make an impact. We joined other top-tier Canadian corporate 
partners and became a proud signatory of the BlackNorth Pledge. 
The BlackNorth Initiative is on a mission to end anti-Black systemic 
racism in Canada by leveraging the strength of corporate Canada 
to demand and lead change. Kraft Heinz Canada also established 
a partnership with the Hockey Diversity Alliance (HDA) to further 
the HDAâ€™s mission by creating opportunities for racialized Canadian 
youth to access and experience the sport of hockey at the 
grassroots level through various HDA-sponsored programs, 
events, and initiatives
