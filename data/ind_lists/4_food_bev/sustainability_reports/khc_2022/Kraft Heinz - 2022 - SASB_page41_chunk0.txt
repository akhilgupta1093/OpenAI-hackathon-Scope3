Similarly, in Canada, Kraft Heinz participates in the Canadian 
Childrenâ€™s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative  (CAI), which 
requires participants to commit that 100 percent of advertising 
directed primarily to children under the age of 12 promotes only 
products that represent healthy dietary choices, or to commit to 
not advertising directly to children under age 12. Our company 
does not advertise to children under the age of 12 in Canada as set 
out in the CAI report
