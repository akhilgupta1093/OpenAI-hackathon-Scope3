23Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging (cont.) 
232020 was a year that amplified our focus on diversity, inclusion, and belonging. We expanded our Company 
Values to affirm, We demand diversity , and launched our Global Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO, Miguel 
Patricio. The Council comprises executive leadership from across the Company and members of our Board 
of Directors. The Council creates strategic accountability for results, and provides governance, oversight, and 
reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is also a critical driver in fostering real organizational change, 
establishing priorities, managing integrated and cross-functional initiatives, and thoughtfully considering how to fully 
live our Company Values
