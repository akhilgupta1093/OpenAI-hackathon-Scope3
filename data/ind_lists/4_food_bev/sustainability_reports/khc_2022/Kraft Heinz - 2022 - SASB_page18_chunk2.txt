The #WeGotYouAmerica  campaign culminated in a video, shot entirely by employees at our Fremont, 
Ohio and Champaign, Illinois facilities using only their smartphone cameras. The video was then 
featured as a commercial to show the world that Kraft Heinz was here to stay and that together, we can 
get through COVID-19. See the full commercial here .#WeGotYouAmerica:
