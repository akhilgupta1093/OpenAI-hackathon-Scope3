Magic Breakfast 
In the United Kingdom, Heinz  partnered 
with Magic Breakfast , a charity that 
provides healthy school breakfasts to 
hungry and malnourished children in 
disadvantaged areas of the U.K., to 
secure 12 million free breakfasts for school 
children who needed them the most. The 
partnership equated to one breakfast per day, 
five days per week over eight weeks, for school children in the 
U.K. who would usually benefit from access to breakfast club 
programs that were cancelled as a result of schools closing
