Manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and 
maintaining our highest standards around safety, quality and 
sanitation, all while providing a comfortable and secure environment 
for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of 
energy. In this type of interdependent environment, we know 
many opportunities exist to reduce energy consumption through 
operational optimization. We are on a journey of continuous 
improvement to identify our opportunities in this area and capitalize on them. 
For instance, in 2020, our Alfaro facility in Spain successfully reduced their electricity usage by nine percent compared to 2019 by 
upgrading their chiller systems. Chillers and other cooling machinery can consume up to 20 percent of a siteâ€™s overall energy usage. 
Alfaro produces a variety of sauces and condiments, including Heinz  ketchup, mayonnaise and tomato frito. These products need 
to be chilled to the correct temperature before being packaged to ensure food safety guidelines are met. In 2020, the site replaced 
its existing five-chiller system with two larger, more efficient chillers. These newer chillers save over 658 megawatt hours of energy 
each year through better regulation and automation during the chilling process. This optimizes energy use and reduces potential 
manual control inefficiencies. Moving forward, we plan to adopt this initiative across more of our global sites.As a leading global food and beverage company, our scale provides a unique ability to 
test concepts at various sites, learn from ourselves, prove outcomes and then implement 
successful energy savings initiatives across our business
