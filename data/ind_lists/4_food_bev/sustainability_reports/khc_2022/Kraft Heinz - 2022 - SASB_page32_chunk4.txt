In 2020, Plunket and Wattie’s , celebrated an amazing milestone – a 
30-year partnership working together to support Kiwi whānau – 
the extended family of New Zealanders. In 1990, Wattie’s -Plunket 
Baby Foods was co-launched. Today, Wattie’s  continues to support 
Plunket and New Zealand whānau. Along with providing funds to 
help keep Plunket’s services running, Wattie’s  and Plunket also work 
together providing helpful information and resources for whānau 
about infant nutrition and starting solids, in line with the New 
Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines
