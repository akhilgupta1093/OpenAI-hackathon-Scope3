immune, microbiota and metabolome maturation in infants in a clinical trial of Lactobacillus paracasei 
CBA L74-fermented formula,” demonstrated that a fermented infant formula favors the maturation of 
the immune system, microbiome and metabalome. 
Bioengineering (BE) Position 
Providing our consumers and their families with quality, great-tasting, safe products in a transparent 
and socially responsible way is and will always be our highest priority. Although the safety of genetically 
modified (GM) ingredients or bioengineering (BE) has been affirmed by virtually every major scientific 
authority worldwide, we know some consumers may have questions about this technology. We respect 
their desire to know more about the foods they eat. 
We believe BE technology can help increase the food supply, keep costs affordable, and decrease the 
use of pesticides, water and overall production costs. In fact, several types of bioengineered food such 
as soy, corn and beet sugar are currently being cultivated and exported worldwide. These crops are 
used to make a wide variety of food and beverage ingredients and are not typically segregated from 
food made without BE
