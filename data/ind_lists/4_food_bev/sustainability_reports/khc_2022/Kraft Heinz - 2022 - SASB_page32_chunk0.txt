Supporting Communities in Need  (cont.) 
The Lunchbox Fund
Founded in 2005, the Lunchbox Fund provides impoverished 
and food insecure children aged 1 - 18 with nutrient fortified food 
daily, at school to incentivize attendance, across South Africa. 
These children would otherwise go hungry. This meal encourages 
children to attend school and enables them to concentrate and 
learn while they are there. Children are supported at all stages 
of their education – from pre-school through to primary and 
secondary school and after-school programs. In 2020, The Kraft 
Heinz Foundation supported this organization’s laudable efforts at 
feeding malnourished children in need, made even more dire by 
COVID-19 impacts
