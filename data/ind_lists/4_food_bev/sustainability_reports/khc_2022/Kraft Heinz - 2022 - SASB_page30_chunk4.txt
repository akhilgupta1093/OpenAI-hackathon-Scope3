“Strategic partnerships like this one between Heifer International and Kraft Heinz 
will enable us to connect more people in need with fresh, healthy food, while 
building food systems to support long term availability and a more equitable 
future for producers and consumers. Non-profits and for-profits doing the right 
thing together will provide a greater impact in helping to alleviate hunger and 
poverty. Together, we will be providing 81.1 million meals (in 2020) to families 
in rural communities across the world. We are proud of this partnership and the 
good we are doing together.”
