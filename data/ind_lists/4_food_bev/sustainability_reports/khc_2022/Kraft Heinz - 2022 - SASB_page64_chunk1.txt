Our Expert Committees  
In 2019, we established an advisory committee composed of 
livestock, poultry, aquaculture, and fisheries welfare experts. This 
committee provides guidance on science and best practices, 
animal welfare assessment, and emerging topics in animal welfare. 
In 2020, our advisory committee helped guide Kraft Heinz across 
these areas for immediate efficacy as well as for future planning. 
Our animal welfare specialist provides training on farm animal 
production and welfare to cross-functional team members within 
the company. Our animal welfare specialist also leads our ESG 
Steering Group Subcommittee on Animal Welfare, as well as 
conducts quarterly meetings with an expanded multi-disciplined 
team. Together, these various committees join into what is a 
powerful system supporting sound practices and implementation 
of our animal welfare objectives. For example, in 2020, we laid 
the groundwork for improvements to our animal welfare policies. 
Externally, our specialist serves on the animal welfare committees 
of the North American Meat Institute and the National Turkey 
Federation.Our Supply Partners
Our suppliers are our partners in humane animal care and its 
continuous improvement. We expect suppliers to maintain strict 
standards of animal care and raise animals in accordance with the 
laws and ordinances in their locale. We require our suppliers to 
have a zero-tolerance policy for animal abuse and neglect, and to 
train all individuals working with or around live animals. In addition 
to the Global Animal Welfare Policy, animal welfare expectations 
are delineated in the Kraft Heinz Ingredient Supplier Quality 
Expectations Manual and product specifications. When evidence of 
non-compliance exists, Kraft Heinz may suspend the supplier 
until corrective actions have been implemented. Suppliers 
who do not align with the requirements or do not 
make continuous and positive improvements to 
meet them risk losing Kraft Heinz as a customer
