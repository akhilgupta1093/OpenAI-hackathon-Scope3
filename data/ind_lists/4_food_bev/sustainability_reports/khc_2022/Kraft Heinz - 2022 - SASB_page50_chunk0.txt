Water Risk Assessment
In early 2018, we completed a water risk assessment of our global manufacturing operations. This 
work was completed by Antea Group, a leading global sustainability consulting firm and provider of 
water resource expertise to the food and beverage sector who is also certified by CDP . The assessment 
leveraged both WRI’s (World Resources Institute) Aqueduct data and methodology along with the 
subject matter expertise of our consulting partner. We then evaluated our watershed conditions 
from a business perspective in order to validate ‘economic scarcity’ factors not fully addressed by the 
database indicators. The completed assessment resulted in identification of physical, reputational/
social and quality water risks, as well as composite scores for each area associated in our direct 
manufacturing operations. In 2020, we updated our water risk assessment again led by Antea Group. 
At the end of 2020, we owned 78 manufacturing sites globally and leased 3 sites. Of the total 81 sites 
that we operated in, we completed a watershed risk assessment of 79 sites. Water use from these 79 
sites derived from 66 percent municipal, 25 percent bore and nine percent surface.  
After an internal expert committee evaluation, it was determined that 19 of the 79 sites 
evaluated had some degree of elevated water stress (see map to the right). In addition to our 
new water reduction targets, we have also developed a plan that focuses on these high-risk water 
areas to drive improvements and mitigate risks, and to provide updates into our risk evaluation on an 
ongoing basis. Moreover, we will evaluate any interim mitigation strategies as needed
