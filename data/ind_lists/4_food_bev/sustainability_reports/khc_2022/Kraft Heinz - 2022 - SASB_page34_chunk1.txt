We aim to achieve our overall nutrition compliance target by: 
• Reducing total sugar in our products by more than 60 million 
pounds across our global portfolio based off of 2019 volumes 
by 2025. In 2020, we nominally decreased total sugar in our 
products by less than one percent of our 2025 commitment, 
and set initial roadmaps for key projects that we anticipate will 
enable us to achieve this challenging target in years to come
• Reducing sodium by an additional five percent in our BBQ 
Sauce and Kraft Salad Dressings in North America by 2025. 
• Simplifying ingredients. 
• Increasing our offerings of plant-based proteins. 
We have set up a cross-functional team to also evaluate how 
our products can be simplified by using more ingredients that 
consumers recognize and are likely to use at home in their kitchens. 
Our teams have initially focused on artificial flavors, preservatives 
and colors. More information on our progress in this space can be 
seen on page 3 7
