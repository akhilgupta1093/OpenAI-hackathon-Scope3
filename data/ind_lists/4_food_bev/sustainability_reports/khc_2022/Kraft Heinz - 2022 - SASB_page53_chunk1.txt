SPOTLIGHT ON MONT ROYAL
Improved Recycling at Mont-Royal 
In 2020, our employees at our Mont-Royal manufacturing site in Canada 
helped to develop and carry out a complete overhaul of our materials 
sorting system on each of our production lines. We were able to improve 
the percentage of materials recycled and better segregate them. This led 
to a reduction of contamination that otherwise can cause recyclables to 
instead be landfilled. We achieved a 10 percent reduction year over year 
in the amount of waste sent to the landfill at Mont-Royal. Moreover, we 
have reached an 83 percent recycle rate
