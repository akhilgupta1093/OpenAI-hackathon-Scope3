Stewardship
Environmental stewardship begins with our 
operational footprint, where we actively strive  
to conserve water and energy, reduce emissions, 
minimize waste and make our  
packaging sustainable. 
Our manufacturing sites can consume substantial 
amounts of resources, and are controlled 
by us, so we focus significant efforts around 
environmental stewardship inside of our walls
