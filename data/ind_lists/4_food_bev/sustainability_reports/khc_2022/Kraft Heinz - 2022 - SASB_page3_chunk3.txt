Last year, we introduced the cross-functional approach we are taking to Environmental Social 
Governance (ESG) at Kraft Heinz as we work to deliver on our commitments by the year 2025. Three 
broad pillars center our ESG commitments and goals: Healthy Living & Community Support , 
Environmental Stewardship , and Responsible Sourcing . Our ESG strategy also brings to life one of 
our six Company Values, We do the right thing . We are committed to making this real in every aspect 
of our business. We are focusing on high-priority issues in areas where we can make the greatest 
impact. Doing the right thing is essential to how we operate â€“ and it is essential to the success of our 
long-term business strategy
