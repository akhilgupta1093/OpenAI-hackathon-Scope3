Our Ownerversity learning experiences include opportunities 
for employees to learn more about diversity, inclusion, and 
belonging, and we deliver a multitude of offerings throughout 
the year aimed at empowering employees, developing inclusive 
leaders, interrupting bias across the employee experience, and 
fostering inclusion and belonging. We also collaborate with our 
Business Resource Groups across the globe to deliver compelling 
programming that connects employees, increases allyship, and 
elevates diversity, inclusion, and belonging across Kraft Heinz. 
The Leadership and Culture Academy is for all Kraft Heinz 
employees and focuses on leadership development, manager 
excellence, and provides opportunities for employees to learn 
how to live our Purpose and Values every day. 
27The nine Functional Academies target employees 
within a specific function, providing a learning home 
for everyone at Kraft Heinz. Each Functional Academy 
helps facilitate the development of functional 
capabilities for employees and their teams to thrive  
in their roles, which delivers value to Kraft Heinz.  
The Functional Academies focus on Finance, IT, Legal, 
Marketing, Operations, People, Procurement, R&D, 
and Sales. 
In September 2019, we launched the 
#LearnLikeAnOwner Challenge to the entire  
company and invited employees to join leadership  
in this movement to encourage a culture of continuous 
learning, bold creativity, and intellectual curiosity. The 
movement is truly global as anyone can learn anywhere  
and at any time.
