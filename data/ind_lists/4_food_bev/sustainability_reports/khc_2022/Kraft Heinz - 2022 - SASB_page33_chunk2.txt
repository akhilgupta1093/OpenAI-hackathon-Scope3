Second Harvest Heartland  
Minnesota Central Kitchen (MCK) is an initiative of Second  
Harvest Heartland, harnessing the power of the food bank  
to bring nutritious, prepared meals to communities facing the 
biggest meals gap.  
MCK was born in the early days of the pandemic to rescue 
abandoned food, re-employ furloughed workers, and get urgently 
needed meals to people facing hunger. Today, through a robust 
community network of more than 100 partners, they are ensuring 
ready-to-eat meals are available in communities and to families 
who need it most
