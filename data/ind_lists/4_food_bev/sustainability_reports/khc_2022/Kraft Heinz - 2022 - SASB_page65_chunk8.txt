Testing of Food Ingredients
Kraft Heinz does not support or condone the use of animals for research 
that is not essential to food safety, and we do not maintain any testing 
facilities. When required by governmental agencies, ingredient safety 
testing is completed by accredited third-party facilities following 
appropriate animal welfare guidelines. We do not support unnecessary 
testing and are advocates for replacing animal testing with other validated 
research methods
