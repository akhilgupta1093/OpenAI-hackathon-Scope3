Safety in the Workplace 
Kraft Heinz is committed to providing a healthy, safe and secure 
workplace for employees, contractors and all people who visit our 
facilities. Safety Management is built into our fully integrated Kraft 
Heinz Management System (KHMS), combining best-practice 
safety principles with other operational functions in a continuous 
improvement framework. KHMS states clear expectations 
and practical steps to manage risk and avoid injuries, and 
requirements are followed in every Kraft Heinz Facility. 
We track and measure implementation through internal audits, 
with results reflected in Management-by-Objectives KPIs 
and Factory Championship rankings. Due to robust site-level 
implementation, Kraft Heinz improved its safety KPIs over the last 
year, representing some of the best results among our food and 
beverage industry peers. Total Recordable Incident Rate 
Our compiled worldwide Total Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) is a medical incident rate based on the 
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 
hours). 2020 was a very successful year in our Worldwide Safety 
Performance, resulting in a 0.74 TRIR. Kraft Heinz is proud of 
its safety track record, having delivered year-over-year incident 
reductions since its inception.
