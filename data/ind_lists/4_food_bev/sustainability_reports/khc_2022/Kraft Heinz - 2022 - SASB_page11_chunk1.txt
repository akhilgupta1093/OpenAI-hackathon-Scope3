Reporting a Concern 
To help employees report potential misconduct, the Company 
provides several ways to report this, including through managers, 
Human Resources, Legal and the Ethics & Compliance team. In 
addition, we have a confidential Ethics & Compliance Helpline 
for reporting an ethics or compliance concern. The Helpline has 
multilingual staff available 24 hours a day. It is accessible globally 
by a toll-free phone call or online at KraftHeinzEthics.com . We do 
not tolerate retaliation against an employee who reports potential 
misconduct in good faith
