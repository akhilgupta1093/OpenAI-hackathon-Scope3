Employees not only #MakeTimeForLearning , they also share what they learn with other employees through a Kraft Heinz 
internal communications platform called KetchApp. 500 Kraft Heinz learners made commitments in Q4 2019; these 500 
learners completed over 3,000 hours of learning in that quarter. In 2020, the movement grew, and over 1,100 employees 
made a #LearnLikeAnOwner commitment and engaged in over 44,000 learning experiences.

custom Kraft Heinz learning experiences and curated playlists to help employees find training more easily. We launched the 
next evolution of Ownerversity in December 2020. The new Ownerversity experience was designed to motivate employees

realization of the enterprise strategy
