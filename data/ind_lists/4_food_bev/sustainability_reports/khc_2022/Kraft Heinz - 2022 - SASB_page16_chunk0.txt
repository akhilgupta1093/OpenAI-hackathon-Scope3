HEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORT
APPENDIXKraft Heinz has a diverse portfolio of products to suit a vast array of eating 
occasions and lifestyle choices. A key part of our corporate strategy is naturally 
a commitment to people, to nutrition and health, and to live our purpose 
‘Let’s Make Life Delicious .’ Some of the actions we are taking to support this 
commitment include ongoing improvements to the nutrition of our product 
portfolio, transparent and responsible marketing and communications, and 
alignment with credible science and public health goals. Through these 
actions, we aim to contribute to the key priorities and target achievements 
outlined by the World Health Organization’s Global Action Plan for the 
Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases, as well as several 
of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aim to 
promote responsible production and consumption as well as overall health 
and well-being. We are specifically targeting achievement of the SDG Zero 
Hunger through our partnership with organizations such as Rise Against 
Hunger, Heifer International and Feeding America, and through our 
operational food donation programs. Our communities are the foundation 
of our society, and reflect what’s best in us as we lean in and support their 
everyday needs. Moreover, during challenging times, whether from impacts 
from catastrophic weather events, social inequity unrest, or a devastating 
pandemic, Kraft Heinz strives to rise to the occasion and provide relief 
wherever we can.Healthy Living  &
