The Kraft Heinz Sustainable Agriculture Practices guides our engagement strategy with our 
growers through 2025. We aim to dig deep in our roots to use 150 years of forward-looking, 
responsible agricultural and human rights practices to build on our agricultural legacy 
with our farmers. We are committed to bringing forward our sustainability heritage, as 
Henry J. Heinz (founder of the H.J. Heinz Company) famously noted, “Protect the 
consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil to the table.” 
We are excited to begin reworking this program and commit to sharing our 
progress
