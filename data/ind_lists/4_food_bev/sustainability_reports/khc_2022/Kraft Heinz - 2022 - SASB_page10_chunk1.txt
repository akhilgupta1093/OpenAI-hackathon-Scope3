Enterprise Risk Management
Kraft Heinz has an established, comprehensive approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). 
Annually, senior management evaluates changes and required updates to the top enterprise risks. The 
ERM process covers a broad spectrum of risks across several dimensions: strategic, financial, operational, 
legal & regulatory, human capital, and hazard/catastrophic. Senior management prioritizes the risks and 
develops the Kraft Heinz risk profile, which is shared with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
annually. Each risk owner provides regular updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
