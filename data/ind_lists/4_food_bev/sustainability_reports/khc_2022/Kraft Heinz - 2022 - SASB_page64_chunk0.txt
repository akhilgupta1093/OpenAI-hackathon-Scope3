INTRODUCTION65When painful procedures need to be performed, we encourage 
pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. Kraft 
Heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue 
continuous improvement consistent with the Five Freedoms and 
good animal welfare. 
Kraft Heinz believes animals deserve to be treated humanely. 
Public interest in farming and animal care is continually increasing 
and consumers desire farming practices that match their values and 
expectations. Good animal welfare, environmental sustainability, 
and healthy people form an interconnected system, and well-
managed farms reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food 
supply. Knowing this, we integrate science and societal ethics in 
our animal welfare decisions. Kraft Heinz is transparent about our 
supply practices and progress. These are disclosed via our Global 
Animal Welfare Policy , website  and through our ESG reports. 
Our Animal Welfare Policy applies to the entire global company 
and all its business units that use animals or animal products. A 
global steering group monitors compliance to this policy and 
reviews it biennially to ensure it remains consistent with current 
science, best production practices, and societal values
