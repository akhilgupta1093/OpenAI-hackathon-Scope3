We are committed to providing better products through reformulation and new developments. We aim 
to provide more natural products, more fruits and vegetables and smaller serving sizes, and are focused on 
including important nutrients. We make all Kraft Heinz products conform with applicable local laws and codes in 
the country of manufacture and marketing. If national legislation is not available, Kraft Heinz products adhere to 
the Codex Alimentarius (Codex), a collection of internationally recognized food standards, codes of practice and 
guidelines
