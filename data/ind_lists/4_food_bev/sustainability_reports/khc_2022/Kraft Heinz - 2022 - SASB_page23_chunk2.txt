Impact Across  
Our Global Footprint
2020 was a year of transformational growth for Kraft Heinz – and in the U.S., we had 
an opportunity to put our new Value, We demand diversity , to the test. As the spotlight 
intensified on racial and social injustice across the country, here at Kraft Heinz, we felt 
compelled to take action. In the second quarter, we announced several commitments to 
positively impact Kraft Heinz and our communities. Our Black Business Resource Group (BRG) 
was instrumental, partnering with Company leadership to establish our commitments and 
contributed to bold and honest conversations across the Company. These commitments focused 
on four areas – recruitment; employee support and development; leadership and representation; 
and community support. Here are a few highlights from our commitment areas during the year:
