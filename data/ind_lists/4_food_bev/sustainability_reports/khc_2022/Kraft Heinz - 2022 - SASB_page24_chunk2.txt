in local chapters and started initiatives 
in their respective locations across the 
globe. Within our International BRG, 
membership rose in 2020 to over 250 
employees, setting the foundation for 
a continued roll-out across the globe 
in the years to come. 
Our BRGs in the International Zone include:
