“Thanks to the support of Kraft Heinz Foundation, MCK partnered with Chef Sean 
Sherman and his Indigenous Food Lab team to provide meals to those most 
affected by COVID-19 and the social uprisings following George Floyd’s death. In 
addition, Kraft Heinz Foundation’s grant supported meals produced by Appetite 
for Change for families in North Minneapolis that had urgent food needs.”

The Brotherhood Sister Sol
“Kraft Heinz has been an invaluable partner to The 
Brotherhood Sister Sol in our work to respond to the 
disparate impact of the COVID-19 crisis on low-income 
communities of color. From generous in-kind donations of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, 
as well as Thanksgiving food items for our Fall food drive, to critical financial support 
of our emergency food distribution, Kraft Heinz has been an indispensable friend to 
BroSis and our youth members. Our work in the past year - including 700,000 meals 
provided and robust support services to hundreds of young people to achieve change - 
would not be possible without Kraft Heinz.” 
– John Dumey, Director of Development, The Brotherhood Sister Sol
