ESG Materiality Assessment  
To inform our ESG strategy and goal-setting, Kraft Heinz conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality 
assessment every three to five years, with respective smaller interim updates as appropriate. This 
assessment allows us to identify and prioritize the environmental, social and governance issues that are 
of greatest concern to our stakeholders and which impact the success of our business. We reevaluate 
these results on an ongoing basis to reflect any changes in standing on these priority issues and allow for 
the inclusion of new or emerging issues. 
We treat our ESG materiality matrix as a living assessment based on participant input. We continue 
to evaluate material ESG issues to our key stakeholders and the respective impact on our business 
operations across dynamic global markets. 
Our ESG materiality matrix depicts the outcomes of the following assessments:
2016: We developed our first ESG materiality assessment as a new company. 
2019: We added several issues to reflect their rising importance to our stakeholders and potential 
business impacts, including Consumer Trends and Innovation, Food Waste, Diversity and Inclusion, and 
Ingredient Transparency and Responsible Labeling. 
2020:  As a result of additional engagement with key business partners and employees, we adjusted 
the weight of “Human Rights” materiality, as well as separated out “Sustainable Sourcing/Agriculture,” 
adjusted the nomenclature to more accurately reflect the area of impact for Kraft Heinz, and weighted 
accordingly, into the two distinct areas of “Responsible Sourcing” and “Sustainable Agriculture.” We 
also adopted the nomenclature of Environmental Social Governance (ESG) as the overarching framework 
for the Kraft Heinz sustainability platform
