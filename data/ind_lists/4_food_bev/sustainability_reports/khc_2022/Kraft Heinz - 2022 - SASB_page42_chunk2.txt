Facts Up Front: U.S.  
We have widely implemented the  Facts Up Front  program for key 
Kraft Heinz products to help consumers plan nutritious meals for 
their family. This voluntary program was developed in the U.S. in 
2011 to increase nutrition transparency and access by displaying 
calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium on the front of each 
package. The visual informs our consumers about the nutrients in 
each product and how they fit into a balanced and healthy diet as 
part of the federal daily dietary advice.Health Star Rating: Australia & New Zealand 
Kraft Heinz has participated in Australia  and 
New Zealandâ€™s  voluntary Health Star Rating 
front-of-pack labeling program since 2014. The 
Health Star Rating system is a government-
backed system developed in collaboration with 
public health experts, the food industry and 
consumer groups. The rating system helps consumers compare 
food options and make more informed food choices. Kraft Heinz 
continues to support and implement Health Star Ratings on a 
wide number of our packaged food products. In 2020, the Health 
Star Rating front of pack label was included on 23 percent of our 
eligible Kraft Heinz products in Australia and New Zealand
