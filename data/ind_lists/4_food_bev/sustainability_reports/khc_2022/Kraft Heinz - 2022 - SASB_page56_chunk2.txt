In 2020, we began a partnership with Loop, a waste-free online shop, that allows consumers to responsibly buy 
products in refillable packaging which is collected, cleaned and refilled after use. We launched a special Heinz  
tomato ketchup bottle adorned with the Loop logo to select U.K. 
customers. Heinz  sells approximately 650 million bottles of tomato 
ketchup around the world every year and this partnership marks 
a significant step forward towards our sustainable packaging 
commitments. We plan to expand this collaboration to cover 
more products and regions in the coming years
