Board of Directors 
Comprised of diverse, experienced and qualified leaders with 
strong credentials, our Board of Directors establishes corporate 
policies, sets strategic direction and oversees management, 
which is responsible for our day-to-day operations. Guided by its 
Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board aims to foster the 
Companyâ€™s long-term success and provides strategic direction to 
help us achieve meaningful results worldwide. 
The Board of Directors helps establish and oversee our global 
ESG objectives and framework, including matters related to 
operations, our supply chain, animal welfare, climate change, the 
environment, nutrition and well-being, and social issues. In 2020, 
the Board of Directors moved primary responsibility for overseeing 
ESG objectives from the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee to the Operations and Strategy Committee. Members 
of the committee reviewed all significant ESG policies, processes 
and commitments, and received regular updates from the ESG 
team on progress against key performance indicators and other 
relevant developments
