SmartLabel ®
In the U.S. and Canada, we provide product information through 
the SmartLabel  website. Responding to the information needs of 
today’s consumer, the SmartLabel™ initiative enables Kraft Heinz to 
provide consumers with the detailed information they seek about 
our products. More than 3,400 Kraft Heinz products have been 
listed on smartlabel.org , with plans to add more for both the U.S. 
and Canada. See www.smartlabel.org/products  to find Kraft Heinz 
products. Traffic Light: 
United Kingdom
Our journey toward more transparency 
involves listening to our stakeholders. By 
participating in the Traffic Light  program in 
the U.K., we hope to provide consistency 
in labeling to U.K. consumers. Under the 
traffic-light system, food and drink labels 
show whether levels of sugar, salt and fat are high, medium or low 
using red, amber and green traffic light colors – and is based on 
the amount per 100g
