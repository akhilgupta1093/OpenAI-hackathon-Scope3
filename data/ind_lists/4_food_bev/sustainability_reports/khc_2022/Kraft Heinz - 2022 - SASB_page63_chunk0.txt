INTRODUCTION
RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGA Culture of Animal Welfare
Kraft Heinz believes that animals deserve a good quality of life and to 
be treated humanely. We have an unwavering commitment to the care 
of animals in our supply chain. Although we neither own nor manage 
farms, we align with our suppliers in requiring their animals be treated 
with care, understanding and respect. 
Kraft Heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements 
which guide our animal welfare policies and initiatives: 
• Health and Productivity:  healthy animals that are provided with 
quality shelter, feed, and water 
• Emotional Well-Being:  negative experiences minimized and 
positive experiences enhanced 
• Naturalness:  animals perform important species-specific behaviors 
This concept of animal welfare builds upon the internationally 
recognized “Five Freedoms” of animal welfare which include the 
fundamental principles of 1) freedom from hunger and thirst, 2) 
freedom from physical and thermal discomfort, 3) freedom from pain, 
injury or disease, 4) freedom to express normal behaviors, and 5) 
freedom from fear and distress. 
We support housing designs that support an animal’s ability to perform 
species-specific behaviors. Examples include, but are not limited to, 
cage-free housing with perches and nest boxes for laying hens and 
group housing for gestating sows.
