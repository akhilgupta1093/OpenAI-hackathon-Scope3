Sustainability Goals  
in Manufacturing
We previously set 2020 intensity targets in 
water conservation, energy use, greenhouse gas 
emissions and waste reduction, to reduce by 15 
percent per metric ton of product made against 
a 2015 baseline, that we failed to meet as we 
contended with former supply chain challenges. 
Water use decreased by 0.02 percent. Energy use 
decreased by 2.69 percent, while GHG emissions 
decreased by 8.56 percent. Our waste increased 
significantly by 12.42 percent. We recognize the 
shortcomings in our execution in these areas and 
we have both identified and learned from the gaps, 
as well as committed to substantially improve in 
these areas in part through greater accountability, 
prioritization and real-time management. Our 
more comprehensive approach is paying off with 
our new targets. We made significant progress towards all of these goals in our first year of the journey. We reduced water use intensity by 2.8 percent 
for all sites, and by 5.2 percent in high-risk watershed areas. We also reduced the intensity of energy use by 2.2 percent, GHGs by 
3.4 percent, and waste by 6 percent.   We are now confident we have set up the proper management systems (read more about our Kraft 
Heinz Management system on page 52 ) and governance structure, while leveraging appropriate resources to keep us on course toward full 
achievement of our manufacturing goals by 2025
