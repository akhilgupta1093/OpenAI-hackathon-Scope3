Heinz  Australia, found there is increasing interest among consumers 
in reducing their meat intake. The Plant Proteinz soup range offers 
these consumers tasty plant protein-based alternatives to meat at 
an affordable price, so that everyone can make a choice and pick 
up a convenient plant-protein based meal that doesn’t compromise 
on tastiness and heartiness.Organic
