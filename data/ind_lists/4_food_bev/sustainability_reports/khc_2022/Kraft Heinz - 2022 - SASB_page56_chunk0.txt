Better Packaging 
We consider the appearance, functionality, cost and environmental impact of packaging design, focusing on 
product integrity through production, distribution, shelf life and end-of-life. 
In 2020, we launched a Maxwell House  100 percent compostable coffee pod in Canada. Made from plant-based 
materials, all pod components and its inner bag are 100 percent compostable, plus the outer carton is 100 percent 
recyclable. The compostable coffee pods are made up of 85 percent coffee grounds with a paper lid, a coffee 
filter made from cornstarch and a plant-based compostable ring made from over 20 percent coffee bean husks. 
Certified by the Biodegradable Products Institute, this designation verifies that the compostable coffee pod meets 
global scientific standards for industrial compostability and is formulated to break down in a period of about seven 
weeks. So itâ€™s really Good to the Last Drop
