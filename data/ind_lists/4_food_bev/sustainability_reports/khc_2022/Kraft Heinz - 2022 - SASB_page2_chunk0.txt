ABOUT THIS REPORT
This 2021 Environmental Social Governance Report (“Report”) is the third Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report 
issued by The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz” or “Company”). This Report reflects our commitment to transparency 
and provides details for our stakeholders on progress to date against our ESG goals and objectives, which are based on our 
most material ESG issues. These issues were reviewed and updated based on our ESG Materiality assessment. 
This Report does not include details on our financial performance. Details on our financial performance can be found on 
our corporate website  and in our public filings available through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Materiality and its relevant definition as used in this report, sometimes referenced as “ESG materiality,” and our ESG 
materiality review process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material 
for purposes of this Report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies may not be considered material for SEC 
reporting purposes
