Innovating New Health and Consumer Conscious Products...  (cont.) 
At Kraft Heinz, we see challenges as opportunities for innovation 
and a way to provide better products for our consumers. We aim 
to create innovations that satisfy consumer demand for new and 
health conscious brands that they can feel good about. We do that 
by constantly researching, developing and launching products that 
reflect modern tastes, leading trends, and consumer preferences. 
Our focus is on incremental volumes and mix improvement coming 
from new products. We are investing into and developing technologies to address 
several areas, including:
Sweeteners and Reduced Sugar 
Developing innovative plant-derived sweetener bundle 
technologies to achieve up to 50 percent sugar reduction in Kraft 
Heinz products
