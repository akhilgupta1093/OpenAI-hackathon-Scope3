Responsible  
Sourcing
At Kraft Heinz, we not only believe in striving  
to be better every day within our own operations, 
but we aspire to work with our entire value 
chain to continually improve on social and 
environmental factors. 
We are dedicated to responsible sourcing  
and related impacts in critical areas to Kraft Heinz 
and our stakeholders. These include areas of 
focus such as human rights, deforestation, animal 
welfare and sustainable agriculture. We are also 
committed to strengthening our due diligence 
and management programs, while keeping the 
needs of our suppliers and our customers  
a top priority.
