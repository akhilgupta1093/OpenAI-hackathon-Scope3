“In 2020 Kraft Heinz committed funding that is going to support 1,260,000 hot 
meals to 6,690 children in 27 Schools in South Africa. On average Lunchbox Fund 
schools see a 30 percent increase in attendance where our meals are provided. For 
the majority of these children it is their only guaranteed meal of the day.”

Heinz’s Support for U.K. Government  
Care Packages
At times of such upheaval, our concerns must always turn to those 
most in need of support. During the early days of the pandemic, 
our Heinz brand took a leading role with a U.K. Government 
sponsored program to protect the vulnerable. We helped to shield 
these individuals from the food shortages many experienced 
during the initial lockdown, by supplying some of our best loved 
canned food staples as part of the food packages delivered weekly 
to those in need. Moreover, we partnered with peer companies, 
retailers and foodservice wholesalers to plan and activate the 
initiative. In total, we supplied over 15 million cans of beans, soups 
and pasta, becoming the largest provider in the initiative
