Keeping Food on the Shelves
Kraft Heinz is committed to providing nutritious meals to those 
in need and eliminating global hunger --- and the need has been 
unparalleled during the COVID-19 global pandemic.  
In the early days of the pandemic, the food value chain 
experienced unprecedented supply shortages. Across the world, 
our plants stepped up to meet this moment - from soy sauce 
in China to baby biscuits in Italy to Heinz  Beans in the U.K., our 
employees have responded by making the products people know, 
love and trust. Faced with all sorts of challenges, our employees 
have been agile, resourceful and creative. People, working as a 
team, are doing extraordinary things.Looking Out for Each Other
In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 
2020, we immediately launched a global taskforce, 
provided enhanced benefits and implemented 
additional robust workplace safety programs and 
processes in all of our facilities â€“ which became 
a leading benchmark with many agencies. As the 
circumstances and impacts of COVID-19 evolved, we 
continued to adapt our response to protect the health and 
safety of our employees. Read more about our enhanced 
wellbeing programs as part of our LiveWell program 
including benefits, disability and employee assistance
