In September of 2020, we launched Honig  Pulses Pasta.  This pasta is made with 50 percent pulse powder, 
durum wheat and egg albumen. The product has the bite and appearance of regular pasta, but is lower in 
carbohydrates while being a source of protein and is higher in fiber respective to the particular SKU, than regular 
pasta. It is available in three different shapes with different type of pulses: yellow lentil penne, chickpea fusilli, and 
yellow pea macaroni
