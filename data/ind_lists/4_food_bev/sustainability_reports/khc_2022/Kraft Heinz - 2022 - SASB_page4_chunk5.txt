In 2020, we amplified our focus on Diversity, Inclusion, and 
Belonging, which furthers our ability to fully live another two of our 
Company Values – We demand diversity  and We are consumer 
obsessed . We expect our employees to look like the consumers 
we serve. We want the voices within our Company to reflect and represent our consumers as we innovate our products, create 
our marketing, and partner with customers and suppliers. We 
created Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging aspirations  to grow our 
Company’s underrepresented talent around the world and foster a 
more inclusive company culture. 
By the year 2025, we aim to achieve gender parity – which means 
increasing the representation of women in management from 37% 
to 50%. We also aim to reach demographic parity in the countries 
where we operate by 2025. In the United States, for example, our 
aspiration is for people of color to represent 30% of our salaried 
employees by 2025 – whereas this population stands at 24% today. 
We also aspire to nurture a culture of inclusion, so all employees 
from all backgrounds feel that they belong at the Kraft Heinz table.  
In addition, last year in the United States, we made 10 specific 
commitments to demonstrate our solidarity with and provide equity 
for African Americans at our Company and in the communities we 
serve. Although the commitments originated in the United States, 
our actions have expanded across the globe. Open and honest 
conversations with members of our Black Business Resource Group 
and Company leadership led to these commitments, which include: 
• Launching the Kraft Heinz Global Inclusion Council , which  
I chair, to create true accountability for results and oversight
