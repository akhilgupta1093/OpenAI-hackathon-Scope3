RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGCultivating High-Quality  
Ingredients
Sustainable farming practices do more than save important natural 
resources. They also have the potential to considerably increase 
crop yields and provide growers and their families with greater 
economic opportunity. Kraft Heinz has taken significant steps to 
strengthen its supply chain by evolving its Sustainable Agriculture 
Practices Manual (SAP)  and working in partnership with growers to 
implement those practices. 
In 2020, we made progress toward the relaunch of our SAP 
program. The first step was revising the manual, which is divided 
into seven sections:
1. Location Selection and Ecosystem Management
2. Seeds, Seedlings and Rootstock Variety Selection
3. Soil Health and Nutrient Management  
4. Integrated Pest and Disease Management
5. Water Management
6. Energy and Waste Management
7. Responsible Labor Practices, Ethical Conduct,  
  Occupational Health and SafetyWe also became a member of the Sustainable Agricultural 
Initiative with the objective to get 3rd party validation for our 
SAP manual. To this end we contracted SureHarvest which 
will audit the manual against SAI Platformâ€™s Farm Sustainability 
Assessment . Upon successful completion of the assessment in 
2021, we will roll out the program to key tomato growers and 
paste suppliers, navy bean suppliers and our Global Agricultural 
teams.
