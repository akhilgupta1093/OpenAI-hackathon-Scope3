Today Kraft Heinz helps Feeding America achieve its mission in 
a three-pronged approach. First, we help them meet immediate 
hunger needs through food donations from our corporate 
operations. In 2020, we donated more than 20 million pounds 
of food to Feeding America through 33 local food banks aligned 
with our U.S. manufacturing sites, bringing our total since 2016 to 
more than 102 million pounds of food donated. Second, through 
The Kraft Heinz Foundationâ€™s philanthropic giving we are able 
to significantly amplify food donations to families in need on a 
planned basis. Third, we furthermore partner with Feeding America 
through cause marketing and volunteerism, all aimed at our shared 
mission to end hunger
