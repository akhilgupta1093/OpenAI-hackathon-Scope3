Pigs 
In accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe 
that pregnant sows should be safely housed in social groups with 
enough space to perform normal behaviors. The industry faces 
challenges to meet the demand, especially for pork that complies with 
strict regional legislation. Kraft Heinz is working with our pork suppliers 
to transition pregnant sows from conventional gestation stall housing 
to alternative gestation housing. In 2020, 19 percent of our global and 
100 percent of our European pork supply came from sows housed in 
alternative gestation systems. 
Broiler Chickens 
We have committed to improving broiler welfare by 2024. We 
continue to incorporate leading science into our assessment of broiler 
welfare, while we engage with the industry at-large as it redefines 
its guidelines for enhanced broiler welfare. We will incorporate a 
combination of outcome-based and practice-based metrics that 
are shown to demonstrably increase animal welfare. Targets include 
stocking density, litter quality, enrichment provision, and controlled 
atmosphere stunning and will incorporate supplier verification, such 
as auditing. We continue to engage with our United States supply 
partners in meeting enhanced broiler chicken welfare standards. European Chicken Commitment 
In late 2019, Kraft Heinz expanded its animal welfare 
commitments to improving chicken welfare by 2026 as part of the 
European Chicken Commitment . Kraft Heinz continues to assess and 
work to transition its European supply chain accordingly. Though this 
commitment faces some challenges related to supply for example, 
we remain steadfast in our commitment to require 100 percent of the 
fresh, frozen and processed chicken in our European supply chain to 
meet this standard. We look forward to continued engagement with 
our suppliers toward this objective
