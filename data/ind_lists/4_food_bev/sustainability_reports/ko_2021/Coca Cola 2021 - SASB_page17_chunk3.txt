Ingredient Sourcing Percentage of beverage ingredients sourced from regions 
with High or Extremely High Baseline Water StressFB-NB-440a.1
Nearly all of our products contain water as the most critical main ingredient. Additionally, it is essential to growing the agricultural ingredients of our products as well. As reported in our 2021 CDP Water Security Response, approximately 94% of corn sugar, 9.6%, of sugar cane, 30.1% of sugar beet and 4% of oranges we source by volume is grown in watersheds with extremely high water stress.
