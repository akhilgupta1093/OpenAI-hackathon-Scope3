Animal protein production from 
concentrated animal feeding  
operations (CAFOs)Farms that supply Tyson’s U.S.-based poultry operations and 
Tyson’s wholly owned subsidiaries of the Pork Group, Inc. and Cobb 
Vantress, Inc. farms would be considered concentrated animal 
feeding operations (CAFOs) as defined by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. Due to lack of supply chain traceability, we are 
unable to provide a quantitative value related to the livestock and 
outside meat we procure that may be raised in CAFO production 
systems. We invite you, however, to review the Environmental and 
Agriculture sections of tysonsustainability.com to learn more about 
the environmental and animal housing and raising practices of our 
poultry and livestock supply chain partners. Additionally, our Supply 
Code of Conduct establishes the environmental and animal welfare 
expectations we have of our supply partners.
