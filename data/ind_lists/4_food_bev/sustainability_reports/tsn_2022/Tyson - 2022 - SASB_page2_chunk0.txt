Animal Care &  
WelfarePercentage of pork produced without the 
use of gestation cratesWe support housing systems that are well managed and maintain good 
animal health and welfare. Tyson owns and raises less than 10% of the 
pigs used in our pork business, and we work hard to make sure they’re 
as comfortable as possible in their housing environment. We support 
our farmer partners in continuous improvement of the housing they  
use for pregnant mother pigs, known as sows. We also verify good 
management practices by the independent farmers who supply us.  
We do this through our FarmCheck® program, which is an extensive 
audit process involving a third-party auditor that ensures pig farms are 
monitored for proper access to food and water, human-animal interaction 
and worker training
