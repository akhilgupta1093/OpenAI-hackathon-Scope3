Ongoing stakeholder engagement
We have established direct and easy-to-access channels 
for engagement with different types of stakeholders. 
These engagements provide valuable insights on 
stakeholder concerns and topics that they consider 
important. In 2021, we engaged with stakeholders via 
customer feedback, NGO inquiries and dialogue with 
shareholders. We also met with several customers and 
entered into partnerships on sustainable agriculture and 
environmental topics. In  December, during our annual 
Global Investor Day, we highlighted our sustainable 
growth strategy and the importance of sustainability to 
our long-t erm planning. The presentation included a 
Q&A session for our investors
