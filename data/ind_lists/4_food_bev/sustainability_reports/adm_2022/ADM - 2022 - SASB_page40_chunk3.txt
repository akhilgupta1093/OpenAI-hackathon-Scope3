We prohibit all forms of corruption, including bribery, and we abide 
by all anti-corruption laws in every country we do business. We 
have a robust anti-corruption program that includes a global Anti-
Corruption Policy and other compliance procedures and controls 
designed to minimize the potential for corruption in ADMâ€™s global 
business dealings, such as enhanced due diligence, screening, 
monitoring of high risk third parties, and pre-approvals before hosting 
or entertaining government officials. We train employees and third 
parties to raise awareness of corruption risks and applicable anti-
corruption laws in order to both avoid inadvertent violations of the law and enable early recognition and handling of potential issues. Our 
Anti-Corruption Policy is updated periodically to address new risks 
and incorporate continuous enhancements, including an updated 
version of the policy which was published in 2021
