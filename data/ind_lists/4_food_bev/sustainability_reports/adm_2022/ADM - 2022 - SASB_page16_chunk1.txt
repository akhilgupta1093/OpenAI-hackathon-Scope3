In 2021, we announced our new commitmen t to 
be 100% deforestation-free by 2030 along with 
an updated policy to help us achieve that target.  
Throughout the year, we focused on traceability 
and are now excited to announce we have 
moved our target date to 2025. Last year, we also 
announced a new part of our Strive 35 goals â€“ 
a 25% reduction of our Scope 3 GHG footprint 
by 2035
