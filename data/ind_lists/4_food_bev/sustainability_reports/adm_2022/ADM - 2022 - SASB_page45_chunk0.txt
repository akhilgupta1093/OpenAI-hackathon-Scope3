ADM Cares
At ADM, we believe in the concept of shared value creation. ADMâ€™s 
corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns corporate 
giving with our business strategies and sustainability objectives. 
Through the program, we work to sustain and strengthen our 
commitment to communities where we work, live, and operate by 
directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful 
social, economic, and environmental progress. 
The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for 
funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives 
that support education, food security and hunger relief, or safe, 
responsible, and environmentally sound agricultural practices in 
critical growing regions around the world. The impacts from projects 
receiving ADM Cares support are measured through biannual 
outcome reports to allow for ongoing community needs assessments 
and to ensure critical issues are addressed
