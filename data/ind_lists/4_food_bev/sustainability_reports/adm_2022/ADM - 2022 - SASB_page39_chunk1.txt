Our human rights policy applies to our employees and facilities as 
well as our suppliers. To demonstrate compliance, we host Sedex 
responsible sourcing audits at our facilities around the globe. These 
audits allow us to track key risk indicators. At the ADM facilities visited 
in 2021, there were no fees charged to job-seekers in exchange for 
employment, and no collateral was taken in the form of money, 
identification or other personal belongings without workersâ€™ consent 
as a condition of employment by ADM or contracted companies. No 
human trafficking was observed. ADM sustainability, legal, operations, 
and compliance teams work with the locations to identify and 
implement corrective actions. In 2021, ADM conducted 35 Sedex 
audits across all three business units and in eight countries
