In 2021, we launched the first of our Employee Resource Groups 
(ERGs) focused on women as part of our DE&I vision and strategy. 
The ERGs, also known as Affinity Groups, are voluntary, employee-led 
groups where colleagues with shared experiences, interests or goals 
can come together in a safe space to provide support, build a sense of 
community, and promote personal and professional development. 
We also held a Global Women’s Leadership Summit – a two-day 
virtual event aimed at inspiring and motivating ADM’s female 
leaders, as well as providing them with tools to help navigate career 
development to advance more women into senior leadership roles. 
The summit, which took place in March 2021, featured motivational 
speakers and roundtable discussions with members of ADM’s top 
leadership, Executive Committee, and Board of Directors, as well as a 
representative from Paradigm for Parity®
