Designed as the backbone infrastructure needed to support the 
regionâ€™s lower carbon transition, the 350-mile steel trunk line will be 
capable of transporting 12 million tons of CO 2 per year. The pipeline 
will off
er dedicated capacity to transport CO 2 from our facilities in 
Clint
on and Cedar Rapids to be stored permanently underground at 
our sequestration site in Decatur, Illinois. The pipeline would have 
significant spare capacity to serve other third-party customers looking 
to decarbonize across the Midwest and Ohio River Valley
