Environmental Footprint
GHG Emissions - Scope 1 + 2
Each year, we inventory and calculate Scope 1 (direct emissions from 
our equipment) and Scope 2 emissions (from the electricity and 
steam we buy from local utilities) globally for facilities under our 
operational control. With global operations, we select regionally-
appropriate factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA), 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), or 
The Climate Registry (TCR), unless the facility has Continuous 
Emissions Monitoring Systems which take precedent. Our assessment 
includes all six Kyoto protocol gases, plus additional refrigerants and 
is based on The Climate Registry, except where otherwise required by 
law, such as the U.S. EPA Part 98 Mandatory Reporting Rule. 
We have identified several projects to help us achieve our Strive 35 
reduction targets, some of which are highlighted below:
â€¢ Renew
able Energy Procurement: In Brazil, we have signed a 
15-year agreement to purchase 31.9 MWh of energy from a wind 
power plant that will reduce our carbon emissions by 19,000 metric 
tons per year
