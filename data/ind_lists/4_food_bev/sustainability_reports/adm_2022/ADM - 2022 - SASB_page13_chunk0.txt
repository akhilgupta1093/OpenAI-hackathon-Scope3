To support the implementation of our 
sustainability strategy, we issued our 
first sustainable bond in February 2022. 
We intend to use the net proceeds from 
the offering to finance and/or refinance 
projects that meet certain criteria set 
forth in our Sustainable Financing 
Framework. Eligible projects will fall 
under one or more of the following 
categories: (i) green projects related to 
sustainable aquaculture and animal 
husbandry, sustainable agriculture, 
green buildings, energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, clean transportation, 
water and waste management, and 
pollution prevention and control; and (ii) 
social projects related to socioeconomic 
advancement and empowerment, 
and food security and sustainable 
food systems. Strategy
We believe sustainability is critical to our future growth strategy. 
Our strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and 
technologies in sustainability to help us grow and create value for 
our stakeholders. Our Ag Services and Oilseeds business unit is 
focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working 
with growers on low carbon agricultural products. Carboh ydrate 
Solutions is focused on decarbonization as a business, and 
biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions from 
agricultural products to replace petroleum-based products. 
Nutrition is focused on developing alternative proteins that can 
reduce the amount of animal-based proteins that are sources of 
methane and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The growth of 
these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the 
objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 
1.5Â°C threshold indicated by the United Nations
