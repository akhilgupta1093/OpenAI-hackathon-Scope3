Digital Dung Assessment
ADM has made the process of evaluating cattle digestive health 
through manure evaluation easier and faster for farmers in the EU 
by developing the first mobile app that analyzes the risk of ruminal 
acidosis in a dairy herd. Ruminal acidosis is a metabolic disease 
related to the digestibility of certain animal feeds. Cereals like corn, 
barley and wheat are rapidly fermentable carbohydrates that support 
increased milk production but can also generate excess quantities 
of volatile fatty acids in a cowâ€™s rumen as feed is digested which can 
negatively affect feed intake and milk production. Unfortunately, 
afflicted cows may not show any clinical signs before they go off feed, 
lose weight, become lethargic and suffer diarrhea
