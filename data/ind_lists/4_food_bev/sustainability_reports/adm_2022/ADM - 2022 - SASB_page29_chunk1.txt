ansportation Fleet Upgrades: As a U.S. EPA SmartWay Certified 
carrier, our trucking fleet is implementing several fuel economy 
improvements, including upgrading to vehicles with automatic 
transmissions that use adaptive cruise control and governed speed 
to optimize fuel economy as well as swapping out dual tires for 
super single/wide base tires. The lighter weight and reduced rolling 
resistance increases fuel efficiency. In addition, we blend our own 
fuel with ADM-produced biodiesel allowing our fleet to run on a 
20-30% biodiesel blend rather than the standard 5% blend available 
at commercial fuel stations. We are continuing with our trials of 
compressed natural gas and 100% biodiesel fueled trucks with 
positive initial results.TARGET
