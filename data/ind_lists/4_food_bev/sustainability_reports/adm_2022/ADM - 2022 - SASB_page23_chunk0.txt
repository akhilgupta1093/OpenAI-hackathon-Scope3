Transparency and Traceability – We source palm products from 
13 direct suppliers coming from 22 refineries and 1,666 mills. We 
maintain high levels of traceability to the mill – over 99%  - and have 
been working to increase traceability back to the plantation of origin. 
We engage a third-party to verify our traceability data
