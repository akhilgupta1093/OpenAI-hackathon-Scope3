At ADM, we have a robust Environmental Management System 
(EMS) aligned with ISO to manage our operations and facilities. We 
minimize our impacts to the environment by following different foundational procedures and ensure we meet our environmental 
obligations. We launched the company-wide EMS in 2012, and 
since then we have worked to continually improve and standardize 
the structure across all operations and align with other company 
initiatives such as Performance Excellence (PE) and Quality
