Goals, Targets and KPIs
The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end poverty, 
protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. 
The 17 SDGs provide clear guidelines and targets for countries and 
governments, although industry still has a vital role to help achieve these 
goals. At ADM, we have undertaken a mapping exercise to determine 
which SDGs align with our business objectives and in turn, allow us to make 
the greatest contribution toward achievement. Specifically, we are focusing 
our efforts toward Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work 
and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land. 
Below are highlights of some of our activities that support our commitment 
to these SDGs, as well as some of our other company goals
