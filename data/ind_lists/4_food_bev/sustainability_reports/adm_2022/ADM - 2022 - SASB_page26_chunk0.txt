Responsible Pesticide Management
We recognize that pesticide use in the agricultural sector has led 
to concerns regarding the potential for unintended environmental 
and health impacts. We also recognize that worldwide an estimated 
45% of crop production is lost to pests annually. While we do not 
own farms and can not mandate practices, we do strive to work 
with growers across our diverse global supply chains to support 
sustainable practices that substitute natural controls for some 
agrochemicals, foster ecosystem balance, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, and mitigate crop losses
