â€¢ Control
 - If action threshold indicates pest control is required, 
IPM plans outline control methods to balance effectiveness and 
risk. First, growers can use pheromones to disrupt pest life-cycles 
or mechanical control. If these methods fail, targeted spraying of 
weeds would be implemented. Broadcast spraying of non-specific 
pesticides is a last resort.
