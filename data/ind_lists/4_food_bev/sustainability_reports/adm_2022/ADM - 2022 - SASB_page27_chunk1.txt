Sustainable, Certified and Organic 
Product Sourcing
We source sustainable, certified and organic commodities to meet 
customer demand and sustainable sourcing objectives. Several of 
these programs have components that specifically impact pesticide 
usage. Through Field to Market, we are incentivizing adoption of 
cover crops, in addition to other regenerative agriculture practices. 
The ADM Responsible Soy, Doing It Right, Food Alliance, ISCC, RSPO, 
and RTRS programs all require the development, implementation 
and monitoring of IPM plans. Organic farming prohibits the use of 
synthetic pesticides. In 2021, we sourced volumes as follows:
