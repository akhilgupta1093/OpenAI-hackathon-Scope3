We recently set a new, ambitious goal: by 2025, we aim to reduce 
our Total Recordable Incident Rate and Lost Workday Incident 
Rate by 50% over a 2020 baseline. We continue to take steps to 
further enhance the safety of our workplaces. We have launched or 
enhanced efforts to improve occupational safety, including:  
• “T
ake Control” program, which identified over 65,000 machine 
access and guarding opportunities globally
• Near-miss r
eporting and investigation
• New c
olleague integration program
Through these actions, we aim to achieve continuous improvement 
in 2022, which will help us on our path to achieve our five-year target
