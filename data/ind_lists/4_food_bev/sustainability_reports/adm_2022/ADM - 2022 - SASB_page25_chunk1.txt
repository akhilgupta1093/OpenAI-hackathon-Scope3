We leverage regional programs to offer growers in our supply chain 
solutions that work for their operations. In the U.S., we are members 
of Field to Market, and we have regenerative agriculture programs 
that work with growers to plant cover crops. In Brazil, we are working 
with Produzindo Certo to help growers identify best management 
practices for their farms
