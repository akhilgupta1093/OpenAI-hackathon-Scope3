• Our corn w
et mill in Cedar Rapids, Iowa began shipping previously 
landfilled biomass from its wastewater treatment operations to 
a local farmer to help return nutrients to agricultural fields. Each 
month, the site averages four loads of wastewater treatment 
biomass sent for beneficial reuse, diverting approximately 
1,200 metric tons per year of wastewater treatment biomass 
from landfill.WASTE DIVERSION FROM LANDFILL

source separation awareness campaign with its cleaning staff and 
plant colleagues to promote recycling. To support the campaign, 
the facility’s waste vendor provided an extra container that remains 
onsite to facilitate further separation of recyclables from waste 
destined for landfill. The newly implemented program has helped 
improve the site’s landfill diversion rate from 75% in 2020 to 88% 
in 2021
