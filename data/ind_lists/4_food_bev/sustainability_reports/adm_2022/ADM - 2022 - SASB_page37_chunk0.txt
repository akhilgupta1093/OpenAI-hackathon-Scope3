Bio-based Fertilizer Additive
A rising global population and shrinking arable land are increasing 
pressure on improving agricultural output and achieving “more from 
less”. Add in increasingly extreme climatic events and a tightening 
regulatory landscape, and the magnitude of the problem becomes 
quite clear. 
Bio-based ingredients can play a pivotal role in helping the industry 
rise to these challenges. With global pressure mounting against the 
use of pesticides and biocides, using more natural and plant-based 
ingredients are an effective alternative. These components deliver the 
same functional benefits while helping to reduce the carbon footprint 
of the agriculture industry. 
ADM CS43 is a next-generation bio-based crop input that improves 
corn yields. It is formulated to boost the natural power of beneficial 
soil microbes. By stimulating microbial activity, it increases nutrient 
use efficiency, enhances plant vigor and boosts yields. 
This cutting-edge crop input provides the energy source needed 
by soil microbes to boost their activity, resulting in greater nutrient 
availability. In addition, years of research have shown it can increase 
corn yields by seven bushels per acre when used in combination with 
starter fertilizer
