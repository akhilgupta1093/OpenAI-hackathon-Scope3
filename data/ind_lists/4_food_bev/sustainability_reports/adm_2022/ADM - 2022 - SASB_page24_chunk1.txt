Recognizing the role agriculture can play in protecting biodiversity, 
we began working with Parque Vida e Cerrado in Brazil, a regional 
hub for the restoration of native vegetation, scientific ideation and 
biodiversity education. Together, we have developed a project aimed 
at restoring degraded areas along streams and springs in the Cerrado 
of western Bahia, promoting biodiversity corridors within soy farms 
and protecting community water resources. The project is providing 
sustainable agriculture education to growers and local schools, as well 
as creating local jobs that work on collecting native seeds, producing 
seedlings at the nursery, or giving technical assistance on restoration 
to farmers. Going forward, the project will conduct biodiversity 
assessments in Barreiras and Luís Eduardo Magalhães, two of the 
major soy producing municipalities in Brazil. Specialists will capture 
maned wolves and other large mammals to monitor them via radio 
collars and carry out a survey to evaluate the habits of these species 
found in forested set-asides within soy farms. The project plans to 
create environmental education projects in two local schools and 
carry out a campaign to educate the community about the project 
and the wolves.Parque Vida e Cerrado
