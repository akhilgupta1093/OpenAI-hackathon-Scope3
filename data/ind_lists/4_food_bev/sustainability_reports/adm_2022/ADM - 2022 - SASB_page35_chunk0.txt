Operational Waste
In 2020, we launched our Strive 35 waste diversion goal, establishing 
a commitment to beneficially reuse, recycle or otherwise divert from 
landfill at least 90% of our waste by 2035. To achieve our goal, in 
2021 we engaged a third-party waste management vendor in North 
America, tapping into an extensive network of beneficial use and 
recycling outlets. Our operations in Europe and South America are 
currently piloting similar programs. 
Last year, we improved our landfill diversion rate to 83.8%. Some 
examples of landfill diversion projects include:
â€¢ As an alterna
tive to coal, our facility in Cebu, Philippines began 
using wood briquettes to fuel its steam boilers, creating a 
high-phosphorous ash suitable for land application by local 
farmers, reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and waste to 
landfill. The site is now diverting approximately 200 metric tons of 
waste annually
