The project centers on two main activities: installing water tank 
systems for disadvantaged households, and organizing small 
seminars to educate farmers about the best usage methods in 
water conservation and management. 
ADM Cares has donated and supported the installation of water tanks 
for 218 households to strengthen their climate change resilience. 
These water tanks can hold up to 2 cubic meters of water, which 
is enough to cover the needs of one person for four weeks. Clean, 
fresh water is pumped directly to these tanks from drilled wells or 
from rain. The project also provided education to farmers and the 
community on water management, tank maintenance, child nutrition 
and gender equity.TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT
