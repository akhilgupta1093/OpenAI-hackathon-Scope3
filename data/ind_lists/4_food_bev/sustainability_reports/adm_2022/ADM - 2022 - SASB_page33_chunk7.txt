• Compressed Air S
ystem Improvements – We conducted 10 
system audits and 11 leak surveys, repurposed idle equipment, 
and replaced inefficient equipment in our compressed air systems 
at facilities in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. These repairs and 
adjustments are expected to result in around 6,000 MWh of annual 
energy savings
