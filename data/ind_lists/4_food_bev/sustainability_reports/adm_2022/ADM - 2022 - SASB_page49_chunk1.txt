We have a safety and health management system made up of a 
robust list of policies, standards and other supporting documentation, 
including life-critical standards governing our high-risk work. We use 
incident investigation processes and tools to continuously improve 
our management system and operational practices. Internal safety 
audits are an essential part of our governance and serve as an 
important tool to identify opportunities for improvement, reduce risk, 
support our compliance commitments, and share lessons learned. 
In 2021, about 80% of our sites completed the year without 
recordable injuries, and about 90% without lost workday injuries. We 
completed the year with no fatalities and a 50% reduction in serious injuries. Our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) decreased from 
0.77 in 2020 to 0.73 in 2021, while our Lost Workday Incident Rate 
(LWIR) increased from 0.17 in 2020 to 0.21 in 2021
