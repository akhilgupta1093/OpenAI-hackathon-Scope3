ADM Cares grants target three focus areas that align 
with ADM’s mission of feeding the world: sustainability, 
hunger relief, and education, with a focus on agricultural 
education and science, technology, engineering and 
math (STEM) disciplines. In addition to these focus areas, 
ADM Cares programs advance ADM’s sustainability goals, 
with special attention to partnerships that advance. The 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
aligned with ADM’s sustainability and business objectives. 
Specifically, ADM Cares partnerships will support 
Goal 2: Zero Hunger; Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation; 
Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth; Goal 13: 
Climate Action, and Goal 15: Life on Land, sustaining 
and strengthening communities where ADM colleagues 
work, live and operate by directing funding, volunteerism, 
and industry knowledge to initiatives and organizations 
that are driving meaningful social, economic and 
environmental progress worldwide. ADM Cares optimizes 
our social impacts around the world through partnerships 
that advance multiple ADM Cares focus areas, while 
advancing several of the United Nation’s Sustainable 
Development Goals. Through these partnerships, we are 
able to exponentially leverage our philanthropy to make a 
meaningful impact in the lives of many around the world.
