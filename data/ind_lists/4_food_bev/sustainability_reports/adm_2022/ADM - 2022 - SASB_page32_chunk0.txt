GHG Emissions - Scope 3
We have announced a new commitment to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions across our supply chain by 25% by 2035 
against a 2019 baseline. We are focusing our reduction efforts on five material categories: purchased goods and services, fuel and 
energy related emissions, upstream transportation and distribution, waste, and the processing of sold products/goods. This target 
builds on our ambitious Strive 35 sustainability goals. 
To achieve our Scope 3 reduction goal, we will continue to work in close collaboration with farming communities, suppliers and 
customers. We are working with partners in the industry to implement projects that focus on supporting growers in adopting 
practices that address water quality and soil health, such as cover crops, reduced tillage, complex crop rotations, and nutrient 
management to reduce soil erosion, nutrient run-off, and greenhouse gas emissions. We also recognize the importance of 
protecting forests and watersheds as critical carbon sinks. Ensuring we only source deforestation-free commodities in our supply 
chains will reduce land use change emissions
