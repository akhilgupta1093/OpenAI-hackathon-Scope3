We published over 80 global and regional compliance 
communications in 2021 to improve employee understanding 
of ethics and compliance expectations, enhance awareness of 
compliance risks, provide guidance on courses of action, and increase 
transparency into how ADM investigates and remediates issues of 
concern. The communications covered topics such as anti-corruption, 
data privacy and records retention, conflicts of interest, trade 
sanctions, speaking up, and more. We also launched the Compliance Compass, which is an internal bi-monthly awareness campaign that 
features case studies highlighting real-world, anonymized compliance 
and ethics challenges faced by ADM colleagues. 
We conducted eight virtual Vendor Compliance sessions to manage 
risk related to our third-party relationships around the world. In 
these sessions, regional business leaders and compliance personnel 
provided training and engaged in rich discussions with approximately 
300 vendors, joint venture partners, customers and other business 
partners on topics such as anti-corruption, conflicts of interest, 
accurate books and records, supplier expectations, human rights, 
privacy, security, and sustainability. And consistent with our 
commitment to ongoing compliance monitoring of third-party service 
providers acting on our behalf, in 2021 we conducted 16 compliance 
audits of third-party intermediaries around the world
