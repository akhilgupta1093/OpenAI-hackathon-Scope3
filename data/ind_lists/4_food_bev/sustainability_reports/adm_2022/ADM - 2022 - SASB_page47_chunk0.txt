Nutrition and Wellness for All
Alternative Proteins
The world’s population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up 
from 7.8 billion in 2020, according to data from the United Nations. 
Assuming this growth rate continues, current projections indicate that 
we will need to produce more food in the next 40 years than we have 
in the past 8,000 years to feed the world’s population. This is going 
to require alternatives that extend well beyond conventional protein 
sources. ADM is a global leader in nutrition and powers many of the 
world’s top food, beverage, health and wellness brands. 
To enhance our capabilities in food grade fermentation and develop 
alternative protein products, we are partnering with the Asia 
Sustainable Foods Platform, which provides precision fermentation 
consulting and technology development to companies serving the 
growing consumer demand in the wider Asia-Pacific region for bio-
based products, notably alternative proteins. Joint efforts, such as this 
one, are one of many ways we are trying to meet the skyrocketing 
demand for microbial fermentation solutions
