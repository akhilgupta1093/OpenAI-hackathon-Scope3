Enhanced Pesticide Protocols
Every ADM facility has a standard operating procedure to manage 
risk from incoming raw materials with oversight and expertise 
provided by the ADM Quality Center of Excellence (CoE). Facilities 
constantly monitor for pesticide residue as an integral part of food 
safety assessment protocols. In addition, the products we make in 
corn processing facilities are put through various process steps like 
ion exchange which ensure any residues from the farm are removed. 
Results are audited by ADMâ€™s robust internal auditing teams, regulatory 
auditing agencies, and oftentimes the customers of finished products. 
In addition to the strict food safety protocols that apply to incoming 
grain, ADM manages pests in its facilities through strict adherence to 
an approved list of pesticides, utilizing the Pesticide Action Network 
resources and guidance, logging all substances used and training of 
third-party pest control operators who adhere to strict protocols at 
all facilities
