In 2021, we engaged a reputable professional 
services firm to undertake a reassessment of key 
topics to guide our sustainability strategy, program 
implementation, and reporting efforts. The assessment 
team applied its knowledge of the GRI methodology 
and our industry to select an initial set of topics 
for discussion. During the engagement phase, 
stakeholders provided additional topics relevant to 
ADM either due to impact to the company or impact 
to stakeholders
