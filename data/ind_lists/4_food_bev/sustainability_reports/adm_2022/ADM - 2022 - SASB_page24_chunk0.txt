Nature-based solutions (NbS) are defined by the International Union 
for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as “actions to protect, sustainably 
manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address 
societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously

communities. Connecting these natural areas provides species a safe 
passageway to reach other breeding population s
