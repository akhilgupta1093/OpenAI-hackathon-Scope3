We’re building a better future. We’re continuing to scale 
up our global efforts. This year, we issued our first-ever 
sustainability bond, representing $750 million in capital to 
support efforts ranging from sustainable agriculture and energy 
efficiency to food security and socioeconomic empowerment. 
The bond exemplifies our broad approach to sustainability. 
Enriching the quality of life means supporting communities, 
such as through our work with the World Food Programme in 
Madagascar, or our support for veteran farmers. It’s about doing 
business the right way, as exemplified by our third consecutive 
recognition by Ethisphere as one of the World’s Most Ethical 
Companies. It’s about safety – always our highest priority, and 
even more so as we support and protect our 650 colleagues in 
Ukraine. And it’s about our work day in and day out to ensure 
the world’s nutritional needs are met
