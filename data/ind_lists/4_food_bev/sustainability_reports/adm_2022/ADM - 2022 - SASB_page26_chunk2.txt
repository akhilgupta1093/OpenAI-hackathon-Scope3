Integrated Pest Management
IPM is designed to reduce risks to human health and the environment 
from the use of pesticides. According to a study published in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, IPM can reduce 
insecticide usage by 95% with no effect on yield. These programs 
use current, comprehensive information on relevant pest species, 
including their life cycles and interaction with the environment. 
Combined with available pest control methods, the information is 
used to design a plan to prevent and manage pest damage by the 
most economical means, with the least possible hazard to people, 
property, and the environment. IPM includes four steps:
â€¢ Set A
ction Threshold - Growers first determine the threshold at 
which pest populations or environmental conditions indicate that 
control actions must be taken
