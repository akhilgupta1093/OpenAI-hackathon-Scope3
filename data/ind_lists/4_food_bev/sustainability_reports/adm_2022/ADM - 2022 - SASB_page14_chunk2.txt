Transition Risks
• Emerging regulation and carbon pricing mechanisms could result in 
incr
eased operational costs in the short to medium term. 
• Changes in poli
cy or introduction of new policies could introduce 
additional tax requirements at our facilities. For example, in South 
America, introduction of the national legislation on biomass based 
power generation units, which requires additional certification and 
taxes , could limit our ability to operate our assets and increase our 
operating costs. 
• Marke
t demand has a direct effect on production, as well as demand 
for certified sustainable commodities. Changes in consumer demands 
could result in additional cost of implementation that may not be 
overcome by product sales. 
• ADM uses coal-
fired cogeneration technology to meet a portion of its 
energy demand. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint of our 
operations, but transitions can be time intensive and costly.Physical Risks
• Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such 
as cy
clones, wildfires and floods could lead to increased direct costs 
from the disruption of supply chains and impair our ability to deliver 
products to customers in a timely manner
