Fuels of the Future
Demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to increase as 
major U.S. airlines, airports, shippers and the U.S. government have 
agreed to work together to advance the use of cleaner sustainable 
fuels. The U.S. and the EU have set goals that together would support 
almost 4 billion gallons of annual SAF production by 2030, and more 
than 45 billion by 2050
