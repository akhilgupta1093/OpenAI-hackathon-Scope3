Scenario Analysis
In 2021, we began the process of conducting a Scenario Analysis following the TCFD guidelines. The analysis looked at the potential impact of three warming 
scenarios: 1.5°C (latest recommendation from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to prevent the worst effects of global warming), 2°C (aligned 
with the Paris Climate Accords), and 2.6°C (status quo). The first scenario assumes a rapid transition to a low carbon world in the next decade, limiting temperature 
increase to 1.5°C. This involves a high degree of transformation across the economy. Under this scenario, the worst anticipated physical impacts of climate change 
are avoided. The second scenario involves ambitious actions to mitigate climate change, limiting temperature increase to 2°C. This scenario requires greater policy 
action; however, there is still an increase in physical climate-related impacts. The third scenario is based on the current status quo with no changes to policies 
or actions and an anticipated increase in global temperature by 2.6°C resulting in increased physical impacts of climate change. ADM used these scenarios as 
written by the sources, except in the case of the third, status quo scenario, where transition risks were evaluated based on our existing Strive 35 commitments and 
implementation plan
