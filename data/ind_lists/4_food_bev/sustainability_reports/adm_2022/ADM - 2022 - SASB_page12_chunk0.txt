and Strategy
Our commitment to change and growth goes beyond our products 
and services. At ADM, sustainable practices and a focus on 
environmental responsibility are not separate from our primary 
business: they are integral to the work we do every day to serve 
customers and create value for shareholders. We are committed 
to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable 
solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, energy, and packaging 
materials while pursuing ways to continually improve our efforts 
in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental 
and social sustainability. That is why our current strategic plan is 
called “Sustainable Growth”
