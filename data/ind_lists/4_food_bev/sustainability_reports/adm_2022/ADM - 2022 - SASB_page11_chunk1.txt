ADM has set forth several key social and environmental commitments 
and policies that collectively outline our expectations for our 
colleagues, business partners and contractors, and our organization 
as a whole with respect to our sourcing operations. They establish 
clear standards that govern our approach to raw material sourcing, 
environmental stewardship and employee conduct, among other 
areas, and they state our positions on issues of widespread public 
interest. These standards were developed with input from our 
operations, law, compliance, environmental, and health and safety 
teams, and were approved by Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano. 
In 2021, we updated two of these policies to more clearly define our 
objectiv es and expectations: our Human Rights Policy and our Policy 
to Protect Forests, Biodiversity and Communities. We also issued a 
Managing Supplier Non-Compliance procedure which describes our 
approach to address non-compliances with these policies.• Policy to Pr otect Forests,

We recognize the role engagement plays in preventing, addressing, 
and remedying concerns. For that reason, we engage with employees, 
communi ties, civil society and other stakeholders to address risks 
along our value chain.  All allegations of potential non-compliances are 
investigated in accordance with our grievance and resolution protocol. To 
promote transparency, we maintain a grievance log on our website and 
post regular updates
