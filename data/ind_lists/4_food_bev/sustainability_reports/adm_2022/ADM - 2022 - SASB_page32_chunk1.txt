Our transportation business unit has been working to reduce upstream transportation emissions by contracting with U.S. EPA 
SmartWay Certified shipping companies. We are also assessing emissions from ocean freight through our membership in the 
Sea Cargo Charter which, aligned with the ambitions of the International Maritime Organization, aims to reduce shippingâ€™s GHG 
emissions by at least 50% by 2050
