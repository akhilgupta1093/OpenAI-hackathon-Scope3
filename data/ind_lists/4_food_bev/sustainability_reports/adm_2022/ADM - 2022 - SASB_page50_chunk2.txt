We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion are key business priorities 
that will enable us to continue innovating, driving growth through 
customer focus, and delivering outstanding performance for 
shareholders. We promote a diverse workplace with equitable 
opportunities for all employees within an inclusive culture so that 
all colleagues globally feel they belong and are empowered to make 
meaningful contributions to the success of the company. With diverse 
backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences, our global teams drive 
innovative thinking, creating growth opportunities through diversity 
of thought. Our DE&I strategy includes four focus areas: Leadership Engagement 
& Communication, Recruitment, Advancement & Retention, and 
Networks & Sponsorships. To ensure our strategy aligns with our 
overall business strategy, we have a global DE&I council. In 2018, we 
made a commitment through Paradigm for ParityÂ® to achieve gender 
parity in our senior leadership team by 2030, and since then, we have 
improved our gender diversity from 21% to 26%. We are proud of our 
achievements to date, and we will continue to strengthen diversity 
within middle management and entry-level hiring to ensure long-term 
parity at the senior leadership level. This key strategic priority will 
continue to strengthen our ability to innovate and drive growth.
