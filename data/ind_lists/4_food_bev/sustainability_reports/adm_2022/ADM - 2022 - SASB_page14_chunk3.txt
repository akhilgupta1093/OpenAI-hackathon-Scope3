• Increased
 severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as 
cyclones, wildfires and floods could lead to increased sourcing costs 
due to limited availability of agricultural commodities and impact our 
ability to produce goods, which would directly affect sales and revenue. 
• Increased
 calls for preserving and enhancing biodiversity by taking 
acres out of production—at a time when the world’s supply of raw 
materials is in great demand—may challenge ADM’s sourcing of raw

• Developing enhanced transportation and warehousing scheduling, 
r
outing and tracking technologies can reduce carbon footprint and 
costs while improving customer delivery satisfaction. 
• Dev
elopment and expansion of low-emission goods and services 
could lead to increased revenues resulting from increased demand. 
As various renewable fuel standards are implemented around the 
world, we have an opportunity to capitalize on the increased demand 
through the production and sale of ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable 
green diesel. 
• As more busin
esses and consumers look to renewable products, 
development of new products or services could lead to increased 
revenues through access to new and emerging markets
