Certified organic foods are grown and processed according to strict

the use of artificial herbicides and pesticides and prohibit the use 
of ionizing radiation and genetically modified organisms. Organic 
growers adopt several approaches to maintain soil fertility and plant 
health including crop rotation, pest-resistant varieties, and natural 
pest control techniques such as IPM
