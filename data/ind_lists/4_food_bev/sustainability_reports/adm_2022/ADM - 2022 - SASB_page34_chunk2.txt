Our water use reduction efforts are focused on 45 of our largest sites, 
which collectively account for more than 95% of our global water usage. 
We refer to these sites as our Major Water Users Group (MWUG), and 
we measure water usage at these sites using a combination of flow 
meters and utility bills. We exclude once-through cooling water from our 
withdrawal numbers because we return the water to its original location 
with only a change in temperature. Although we reuse and recycle 
water through various processes such as cooling tower recirculating, for 
calculation purposes we only include the water reused after it has been 
processed in our onsite wastewater treatment facility. 
To reduce the use of fresh water, we practice the three Rs: reduce, 
reuse, and reclaim. Our sites have adopted best management 
practices for minimizing water use and maximizing its reuse before disposal. Further, we have advanced a number of reclaim operations 
where wastewater is further treated and returned for use within our 
facilities. Across our MWUG locations, we are regularly investigating 
new technologies that could increase water reuse and reclaim 
opportunities and further reduce our fresh water intake
