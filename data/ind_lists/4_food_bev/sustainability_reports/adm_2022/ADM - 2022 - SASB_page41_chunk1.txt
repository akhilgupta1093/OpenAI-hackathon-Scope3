such as employee relations, environmental, health and safety (EHS), 
diversity, equal opportunity and respect in the workplace, and misuse

reports we receive. Each is classified by type and then assigned to 
an investigator to conduct an independent and objective review into 
the concerns raised. If an allegation is substantiated, we implement 
corrective and disciplinary actions which can include coaching and 
counseling, process or control improvement, verbal or written 
warnings, financial penalties, or termination
