Energy
We continue to identify, assess, and implement innovative ideas 
that reduce our energy intensity, allowing us to produce more while 
using less energy. In 2020, we announced our goal to reduce energy 
intensity per ton of product by 15% by 2035 over a 2019 baseline, 
as a part of our Strive 35 goals. To ensure we are on track to meet 
our goals, we set a 5-year interim target to reduce energy intensity 
6% by 2025. 
Our facilities have implemented an energy management program 
based on ISO 50001, with 16 facilities ISO certified. In 2021, we began 
the process to certify another ADM facility, which will increase the 
total number certified production facilities to 17
