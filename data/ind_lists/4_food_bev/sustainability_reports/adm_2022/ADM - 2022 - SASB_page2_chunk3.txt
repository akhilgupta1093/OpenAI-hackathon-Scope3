We’re expanding the universe of planet-friendly products. 
Customers and consumers today are looking for responsible 
production, clean labels, and partners and providers they 
trust align with their values. And last year, we showed how 
we’re meeting that demand. We were proud to announce 
the industry’s first carbon neutral wheat milling footprint. We 
advanced projects to widen the world of low-carbon, plant-
based fuels, including renewable diesel and sustainable aviation 
fuel. We moved forward with partnerships to capture and store 
carbon from some of our largest US facilities. We expanded our 
capacity to meet fast-growing global demand for alternative 
protein. And we continued to grow our BioSolutions portfolio of 
plant-based replacements for petroleum-derived products. 
We’re going to the root of the issue. Our value chain stretches 
from seed to fork, and we’re working with growers around 
the globe to enhance the sustainability and reduce the carbon 
emissions from their critical work. In 2021, we committed to 
a new, aggressive goal of eliminating deforestation from all 
of our supply chains – a goal we have accelerated even since 
our original announcement: We now are working toward a 
completely deforestation-free supply chain by 2025. We were 
also proud last year to unveil our new goal to reduce our 
Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2035 – a goal we’re 
aggressively working toward as we continue to expand the 
number of acres involved in our regenerative agriculture efforts. We’re scaling up our 
work to live our purpose 
and power our continued 
growth and success
