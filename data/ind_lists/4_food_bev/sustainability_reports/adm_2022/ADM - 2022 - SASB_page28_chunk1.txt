Working at the farm level and with smallholder growers, many 
advanced agricultural practices have been identified and 
implemented, including planting a winter cover crop to reduce soil 
erosion; using integrated pest management practices; and using 
technology solutions to identify high production potential fields and 
avoid those with flooding risks. These practices, among others, have 
enabled the successful completion of the Sustainable Agriculture 
Initiative (SAI) – Farm Sustainability Assessments resulting in SAI Gold 
ranking – the first and only peanuts in Argentina with this distinction. Golden Peanut ArgentinaTRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT
