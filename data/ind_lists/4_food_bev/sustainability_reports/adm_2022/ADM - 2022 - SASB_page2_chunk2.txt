But our focus on a sustainable future is broader than that. Our 
purpose is to unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of 
life. And we cannot achieve that purpose without a strong and 
unrelenting focus on protecting our planet, our communities 
and our people. 
With an irreplaceable footprint that spans food, feed, 
agriculture and more, ADM is scaling up its sustainability 
leadership around the globe. When I look back at ADM’s 
accomplishments over the last year, and ahead at our plan 
and our future, I see a company that views sustainability as 
integral to all that we do, from our strategic planning, to our 
relationships with farmers, to how we meet customer needs 
every day.We’re taking on the biggest challenges. In 2020,  we 
announced our Strive 35 goals to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, water and energy intensity, and increase our landfill 
diversion rate. In the pages that follow, you’ll see how we’re 
making progress toward our key milestones with innovative new 
initiatives from heat recovery projects, to wider use of cleaner 
energy, to expanding our water reuse capabilities
