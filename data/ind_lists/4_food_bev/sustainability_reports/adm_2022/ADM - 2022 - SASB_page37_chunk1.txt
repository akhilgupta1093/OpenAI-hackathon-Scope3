Leveraging CCS as a Transition Pathway
As we look to a low carbon future, we are mindful of the role 
technology can play in the transition. Our carbon capture and 
sequestration facility in Decatur, Illinois has allowed us to safely and 
permanently store more than 3.5 million metric tons of CO 2 a mile and a half under the surface of the earth. We recently signed a Letter 
of Intent with Wolf Carbon Solutions US LLC to enable additional 
decarbonization via the construction of a pipeline – developed, 
owned and operated by Wolf Carbon Solutions – which, together with 
a commercial agreement, will allow for the capture, compression and 
transportation of carbon dioxide produced at our Clinton and Cedar 
Rapids, Iowa, facilities
