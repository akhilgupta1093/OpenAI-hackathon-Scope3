We achieved net carbon neutral status through a combination of 
energy efficiencies, purchase of renewable energy certificates, and 
sequestration of carbon dioxide at our commercial carbon capture 
and storage facility. 
Around the world, we have been working to reduce the 
environmental footprint of our operations. At U.S. flour mills, our 
initiatives included energy efficiency projects, technology updates, 
and the replacement of older facilities with new state-of-the-art mills. 
Further, we lowered the carbon footprint of our U.S. flour milling 
network through the purchase of renewable energy certificates which 
represents electricity generation from renewable sources, such as 
solar, wind or hydro. Lastly, we are using carbon capture and storage 
technology to compensate for emissions generated at the flour mills, 
a unique way we have been able to achieve net carbon neutral status.TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT
