Protecting Forests, 
Biodiversity and 
Communities
ADM is fully committed to ending deforestation, and to preserving 
biodiversity and water resources in our supply chains. This includes 
holding our suppliers accountable for producing commodities in ways 
that do not further deforestation in order to reduce impact on 
climate change. We believe that sustainable, ethical and responsible 
production by the food industry is an important part of curbing global 
warming, conserving native biodiversity, and upholding the rights of 
indigenous communities and smallholders. In 2021, we announced 
our aim to eliminate deforestation from all of our supply chains by 
2030, aligned with the United Nations’ New York Declaration. We 
have now announced an accelerated target date of 2025, which 
we will strive to meet through the following:
• Increasing the g
eographical scope of our satellite monitoring in 
supply chains 
• Int
egrating and automating purchase controls in higher risk regions 
• Selecting suppliers based on de
forestation-free scores and 
alignment with our policies
• Increasing pur
chases of certified materials 
• Continuing c
ollaboration with industry peers and associations to 
develop standardized actions 
• Further engag
ement with indirect suppliers
Though we are not a grower of crops, we work independently and 
with other stakeholders to ensure the crops we source globally follow 
a socially fair and environmentally sustainable standard that can 
contribute to the livelihood of the communities where they are grown 
and protect the environment we all share.In 2021, we released our Policy to Protect Forests, Biodiversity and 
Communities , which covers the overarching commitments applicable 
to all of our supply chains, as well as specific commitments to address 
the complexities of the palm and soybean supply chains
