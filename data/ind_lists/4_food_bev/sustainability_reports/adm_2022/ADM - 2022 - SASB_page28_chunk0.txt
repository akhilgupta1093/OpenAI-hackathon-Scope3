Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nut colleagues in Argentina have been 
on the leading edge of sustainability for many years. They started 
their journey by implementing recycling programs and training onsite. 
That first step led to broader initiatives, including sending peanut 
hulls to a local utility to produce electricity, reducing waste to landfill 
and providing a renewable energy source. We have a biodiversity plan 
to protect native species, and since 2016, we have collaborated with 
local high schools to plant more than 800 native trees
