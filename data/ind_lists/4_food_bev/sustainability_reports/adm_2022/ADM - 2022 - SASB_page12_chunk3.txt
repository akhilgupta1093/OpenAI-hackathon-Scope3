The Executive Council of ADM, our highest strategic and 
operational body, provides close supervision of our ESG efforts and 
an in-depth review of sustainability issues. Because we consider 
sustainability critical to our strategic planning and mergers and 
acquisitions efforts, the CSO reports to the Chief Strategy Officer 
and is an important part of the strategy team. Furthermore, 
regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate 
sustainability team, support the CSO to drive sustainability efforts 
in our facilities and supply chains around the world. Our sustainability efforts 
are also supported by the Centers of Excellence (CoE) that drive efficiency 
programs in their areas of focus such as the Utilities CoE, Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion (DE&I) CoE, and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) CoE
