• Waste Heat Optimization
 – At our facilities in Decatur, Illinois; 
Bazancourt, France; Adana, Turkey; and Des Moines, Iowa, we 
have improved waste heat recovery by optimizing energy usage, 
eliminating waste, and adding new heat recovery loops. These 
projects are expected to save over 45,700 MWh of energy annually
