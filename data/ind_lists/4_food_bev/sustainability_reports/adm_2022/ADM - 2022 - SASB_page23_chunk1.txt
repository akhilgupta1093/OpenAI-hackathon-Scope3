Supplier Engagement – We  use the Palm Scorecard implemented 
by a third-party assessor to evaluate the performance of our direct  
palm suppliers. Our findings for 2021 show that we nearly reached 
our target to have 100% of our volumes from suppliers with a publicly 
available NDPE policy, a grievance management system, a responsible 
sourcing implementation plan, and a human rights due diligence 
process in place. The scorecard tool provides valuable insight of past 
performance data and provides us feedback on how to make better 
decisions in the future. We have identified the need to create an 
additional supplier assessment tool to enable proactive screening of 
suppliers prior to sourcing from them to ensure they align with our 
sustainability criteria and standards. 
Monitoring and Verification – ADM continues to participate as an 
active member in the No Deforestation, Peat or Exploitation (NDPE) 
Integrated Reporting Framework (IRF) Active Working Group to drive 
progress on reporting against NDPE criteria. ADM has engaged with 
all its direct suppliers on the provision of their respective NDPE IRF 
profiles. A total of 94.3% of volumes are covered under the reporting. 
In July 2021, we completed verification of each individual site profile 
by an independent third-party. We also report certified sustainable 
palm oil supplies using the volumes of PO and PKO certified by the 
Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Certified supplies are 
driven by market demand
