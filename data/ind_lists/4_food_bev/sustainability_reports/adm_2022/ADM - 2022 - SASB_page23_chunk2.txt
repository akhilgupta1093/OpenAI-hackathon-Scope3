Reporting – In 2021, we began to report the percentage of our 
sourced volumes that are delivering against the No Deforestation 
criteria defined by IRF. These profiles are reported alongside our 
supply chain traceability information on our website.Soy
Transparency and Traceability – We have traceability for 100% 
of our direct and indirect soy suppliers in Argentina, Brazil and 
Paraguay. For direct suppliers, we map to the farm level using digital 
satellite mapping (polygons). This database enables measurement 
of Deforestation and Conversion Free (DCF) volumes, which in 2020 
equaled 97%. For indirect suppliers, we trace to the first aggregation 
point and then monitor a radius around that location for indications 
of deforestation. In areas with a high risk of conversion to soy, indirect 
parties will also be required to show compliance with the company’s 
policies on the volumes sold to ADM
