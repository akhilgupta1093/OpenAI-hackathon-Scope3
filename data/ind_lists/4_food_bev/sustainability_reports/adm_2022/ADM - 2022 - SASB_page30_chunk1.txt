â€¢ NET P
ower: We are exploring efforts to purchase energy from a 
planned NET Power cogeneration facility to be built adjacent to our 
processing complex in Decatur, Illinois. This cutting-edge technology 
uses a semi-closed loop technology that combusts natural gas with 
oxygen instead of ambient air to produce low or zero-emission 
power. Oxy-combustion results in a more pure CO 2 exhaust stream 
that is recycled through the system to drive turbines instead of 
steam. After being recycled through the unit, the CO 2 will be 
captured and sequestered in our onsite sequestration well. Through 
this project, we expect to reduce our annual GHG emissions by 1.5 
million metric tons
