Moreover, we have a large industrial footprint and believe it 
is important to reduce GHG emissions related to our business 
activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. We aim to 
mitigate climate change through renewable product and process 
innovations, supply chain commitments, and a strategic approach 
to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency 
of our production plants globally. We will continue to use internal 
and external resources to identify opportunities and take action 
to reduce our environmental footprint globally to meet our 
commitments and to mitigate the effects of climate change. At ADM, we believe a stronger workforce and community are 
the keys that drive our success and growth. Attracting the right 
talent is important to us, and we strive to create an environment 
that supports our employeesâ€™ safety, growth and contributions. 
Similarly, we aim to ensure the wellbeing of the communities 
where we operate. We assess the needs of communities 
individually and prioritize programs by directing funding to 
initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, 
and environmental progress
