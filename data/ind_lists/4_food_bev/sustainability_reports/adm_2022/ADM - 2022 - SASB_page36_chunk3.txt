Our Columbus, Nebraska and Cedar Rapids, Iowa dry mills as well as 
ethanol from our Decatur, Illinois operations could transition from fuel 
ethanol to serve growing demand for lower-carbon aviation fuel. The 
MoU contemplates the production of both ethanol and isobutanol 
that could then be transformed into renewable, low carbon-footprint 
hydrocarbons, including SAF, using Gevoâ€™s processing technology 
and capabilities. About 900 million gallons of ethanol produced at 
these three locations could be processed utilizing this technology, 
resulting in approximately 500 million gallons of SAF and other 
renewable hydrocarbons. 
The companies intend to work together to determine full 
commercialization plans and enter into definitive agreements 
enabling a timeline such that production of SAF can begin in the 
2025-2026 timeframe
