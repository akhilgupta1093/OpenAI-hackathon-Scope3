In addition to our focus on prebiotics and probiotics, one key area of 
interest, and where ADM has some of the world’s first technology, is 
postbiotics. These functional bioactive compounds are generated during 
the fermentation process. Unlike probiotics or prebiotics, postbiotics 
can be heat-treated, which allows us to combine the biotic with 
other ingredients, opening up a world of possibility when it comes to 
personalizing a wide range of functional food and beverage products. 
ADM Ventures, the venture capital arm of ADM, is one of the key 
investors in Remedy Health, a revolutionary new personalized 
health tech company that specializes in 3D printing an assortment of 
wellness solutions, notably gummy vitamins which now incorporate 
a science-backed ingredient from ADM. ADM’s proprietary HT-BPL1™ 
postbiotic is the latest addition to the Nourished portfolio of 31 
vitamins, minerals and nutrients. It’s another example of how we are 
leveraging innovation and technology to deliver personalized nutrition
