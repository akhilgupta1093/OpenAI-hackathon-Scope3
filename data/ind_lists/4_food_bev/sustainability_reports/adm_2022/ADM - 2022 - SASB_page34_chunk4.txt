• Expansion of Decatur 
Water Reuse Program – We made 
significant improvements in the Decatur water reuse system and 
now have the capacity to supply over 22,700 m3 of reuse water 
per day to our cooling tower operations around the campus. This 
expansion project will enable us to reduce our fresh water intake by 
3.45 million m3 annually in Decatur alone
