Monitoring and Verification â€“ Since 2018, specialized firms with 
GIS technology (satellite imaging) have been cross -referencing 
planted within the farm polygons of our direct suppliers in high-risk 
areas to determine if the soy being sourced is compliant with local 
legislation and our No-Deforestation Policy. Farms are also verified 
to make sure there are no environmental issues (embargoed areas), 
encroachment into protected areas or Indigenous Territories, or labor 
issues which violate our policy
