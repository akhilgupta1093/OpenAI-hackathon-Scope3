Grower Engagement
We work with growers around the world on implementing sustainable 
and regenerative agricultural practices, including integrated pest 
management (IPM) and cover crops. For example, in the U.S., we 
engage growers using the Field to Market metrics and framework. 
Four of the eight metrics are impacted by pesticide application: 
Water Quality, Biodiversity, Energy Use, and GHG Emissions. Through 
these programs, we connect growers with agronomy experts who can 
support the adoption of advanced agricultural practices such as cover 
crops and IPM. In Brazil, our ADM Responsible Soy program as well 
as the Doing It Right program both have IPM as a key component. 
Further, ADM is one of the sponsors of the Soja Plus Program, a 
program organized by the Brazilian Oil Industry Association and 
the Soy Farming Association, that provides training on farms, 
including training on the “conscious usage and correct handling 
of agrochemicals.”
Cover Crops 
Environmentally sustainable pest management starts with building 
healthy soils. Research has shown that crops grown on biologically 
active soils resist pests better than soils with low fertility, extreme 
pH, poor structure, and low biological activity. In addition to 
increasing soil health, specific cover crops can directly assist with 
pest management. For example, cover rye can control some diseases, weeds, and nematodes. Cover crops also provide valuable habitat and 
protection for predators that naturally control pest populations. They 
can act as a key prevention measure of an IPM plan. In a recent study, 
predatory insect populations were 7-10 times higher in cover cropped 
fields. These predators reduce the insect pest population, allowing for 
reduced pesticide application
