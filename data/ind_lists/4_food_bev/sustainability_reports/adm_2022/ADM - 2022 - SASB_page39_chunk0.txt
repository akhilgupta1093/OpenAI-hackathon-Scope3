Human Rights
At ADM, we are committed to doing business with integrity. 
We believe in paving the way with good business practices, 
progressive solutions and mindful actions that make a 
positive impact. 
We actively work to protect human rights in our operations and 
supply chains, taking corporate actions that make a measurable, 
sustainable difference for communities and ecosystems around the 
world. While governments have the primary duty to protect and 
ensure the fulfillment of human rights, we have a role to play in 
protecting human rights in our operations, our supply chains and the 
communities where we operate. We have the opportunity to enact 
change globally, and our 2021 efforts demonstrate our commitment 
to protect human rights throughout our supply chain. 
Our updated Human Rights Policy reflects our commitment to embed 
human rights protections in all aspects of our global operations. The 
new version of our policy aligns with the United Nations Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. It emphasizes the creation 
of a robust human rights due diligence process, mitigation of risks 
and access to remedy. 
The mitigation and prevention of human rights risks in our supply 
chains are at the core of our risk assessment strategy. In 2021, we 
began developing a standard operating procedure to formalize our 
human rights due diligence program. The procedure will define 
a consistent risk ranking methodology, mitigation strategies, and 
action plans. Leveraging third-party tools such as Elevate EiQ and 
Sedex Radar, as well as frameworks like the United Nations Human 
Development Index, we will identify the highest-risk geographies and commodities in our supply chain. As we continue to develop this 
framework, mitigating human rights risks will be at the forefront; 
working with our suppliers to assess and address risk increases 
transparency and enables collaboration to protect human rights 
throughout our supply chain
