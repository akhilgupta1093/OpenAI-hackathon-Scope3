Water and Wastewater
With global water resources becoming increasingly scarce, the water 
crisis has become a pressing issue. The availability of water is vital 
for our operations, which is why we have factored it into our risk 
management framework and developed programs to respond to 
current and potential future water shortages. 
In 2020, we announced our target to reduce water intensity by 
10% per ton of product produced at our largest sites by 2035 over 
a 2019 baseline. To ensure we are on track to achieve this goal, 
we have set a 5-year interim target of a 5% reduction by 2025. In 
addition, to support the health and wellbeing of the communities 
where we operate, we are developing a global improvement strategy 
in priority watersheds by 2025
