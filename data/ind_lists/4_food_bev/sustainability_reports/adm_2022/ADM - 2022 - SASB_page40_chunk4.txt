We have a strong “Speak Up” culture at ADM, which helps us handle 
issues and address problems in a timely manner, building trust 
with one another and with our customers, suppliers and business 
partners and protecting the company from legal, financial and 
reputational risks. We encourage employees to voice concerns or ask 
questions through multiple channels, including by talking with their 
supervisors, Human Resources, or Compliance, or at any time through 
additional reporting channels such as The ADM Way Helpline , which 
is available by phone or web in more than 30 languages. We also 
added a QR Code in 2021 to further enhance accessibility to our 
Helpline. Reporting via the Helpline can be done anonymously, where 
permitted by law. We do not tolerate any form of retaliation for 
making a good-faith report of actual or potential misconduct. The 
ADM Way Helpline may also be used by stakeholders outside of ADM 
to raise questions or voice concerns
