In 2021, we implemented over 75 energy-saving projects across our 
business units. These projects are expected to reduce more than 
175,000 MWh of energy while achieving an annual cost savings of 
$4.4 million. We also continued our global Energy Treasure Hunt 
Program through which we were able to identify additional energy 
reduction opportunities of around 177,000 MWh annually. Some 
examples include:
• Heat Recov
ery Studies – We completed heat recovery studies on 
several of our boilers and cogeneration facilities which identified 
Renewable Fuel 4.0 million MWh
Non-renewable Fuel 49.0 million MWh

reliability. We implemented suggested improvements at our 
facilities in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Gomez Palacio, Mexico; Kershaw, 
South Carolina; and Hamburg and Straubing, Germany. Collectively, 
these improvements are expected to result in annual energy 
savings of over 57,000 MWh
