â€¢ Coal Conversion: At o ur Mank ato, Minnesota; Des Moines, Iowa; 
and Lincoln, Nebraska oilseeds facilities, we have started conversion 
projects to replace existing coal-fired boilers with high pressure, 
natural-gas-fired boilers which allow efficient cogeneration of steam 
and power using a lower carbon fuel. This project is estimated to 
reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by over 150,000 
metric tons per year, and the upgrades will also allow us to pivot to 
other lower carbon fuels such as renewable natural gas or hydrogen 
when they become commercially available
