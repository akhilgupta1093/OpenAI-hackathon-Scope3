Supplier Engagement â€“ We participate in several multi stakeholder 
initiatives worldwide that are leading the transformation of the soy 
supply chain. We participate in the Soft Commodities Forum (SCF) of 
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 
along with other industry/trading companies who share the same goals 
of eliminating deforestation and exploitation in their supply chains. 
Our objectives focus on defining common standards that will bring 
more transparency to the sector as a whole, and searching for financial 
incentives that will protect forested areas and promote the use of 
previously cleared land. We are engaging with our indirect suppliers in 
Brazil to identify and test digital tools that will enable verification of their 
supply with the Brazilian Forest Code and our corporate commitments. 
We also engage with growers through sustainable farming extension 
programs including Produzindo Certo, Sustentagil, and Soja Plus
