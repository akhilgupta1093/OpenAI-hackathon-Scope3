Key Topic Assessment and 
Stakeholder Engagement
Following the guidelines from the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI), we use a third-party to conduct a 
formal assessment to identify and prioritize our key 
sustainability topics that reflect our most significant 
impacts to the economy, environment, and people, 
including human rights. Because these impacts 
may change over time as our activities, business 
relationships, and assets evolve, we update this 
assessment on a regular basis
