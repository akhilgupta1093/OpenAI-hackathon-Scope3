Food Safety and Quality 
We believe food is fundamental to quality of life, and expanding access 
to nutrition is a fundamental piece of how we fulfill our brand promise. 
And the safety and security of our world’s food and feed supply chain 
is of critical importance. That’s why at ADM, we continually review 
and improve our food safety systems and procedures, including 
good manufacturing practices for human and animal food and the 
development and implementation of risk-based preventive controls 
or critical control points for human food based on hazard analysis. 
Our facilities, processes and procedures undergo regular evaluation to 
assess the risk of product contamination, and we implement a variety 
of safeguards and security concepts to reduce those risks. 
We’ve built our Food Safety and Quality program around three pillars: 
achieving best in class food safety, maintaining a culture of quality, 
and leveraging innovation and technology
