Our user-friendly digital tool can estimate the risk of ruminal acidosis 
by uploading a picture of cow dung and answering a few yes or no 
questions. The app draws on the expertise of ADM technicians and 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology to evaluate the quality of cow 
digestion. ADMâ€™s nutritional advisors evaluate the AI-generated 
preliminary diagnostic and then discuss potential solutions to address 
acidosis, including neutralizing acids in the rumen and adjusting the 
feed formulation. Antibiotic Reduction Program
It is estimated that global antimicrobial use in poultry, cattle, and 
swine (which account for 93.75% of all food animals) will increase 
to 104,079 tonnes by 2030, equivalent to a growth of 11.5% since 
2017. In alignment with the global trend to regulate the overuse of 
antibiotics as growth promoters, ADM is dedicated to maintaining 
animal health and welfare through natural nutritional solutions and 
encouraging the reduction of antibiotics in livestock farms
