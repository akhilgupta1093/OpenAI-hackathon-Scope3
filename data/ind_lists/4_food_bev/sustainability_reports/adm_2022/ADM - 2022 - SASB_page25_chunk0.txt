Sustainable and 
Regenerative Agriculture
We believe in taking action for climate change, integrating sustainable 
practices into every facet of our global operations in an effort to minimize 
our footprint worldwide. We recognize the opportunity we have to work 
together with growers in our supply chain to identify and implement 
farming practices that can reduce environmental impact, sequester 
carbon in the soil, and improve on-farm economics and labor conditions. 
Our sustainable and regenerative agriculture programs work to 
identify and implement customized and targeted projects focusing on 
outreach, education, and continuous improvement to drive adoption 
of practices. We have identified five key advanced agricultural practices 
that have multiple positive outcomes such as reducing GHG emissions, 
improving soil health, and protecting water quality. These practices 
include nutrient management, year-round soil coverage, minimized soil 
disturbance, integrated pest management, and diverse crop rotations.

and processor of commodities, we can leverage the relationships we 
have with our customers, upstream and downstream, to implement 
sustainable agriculture programs. Our approach recognizes and 
accommodates the variances in commodities and geographies from 
which we source; not all practices are a good fit for every farm
