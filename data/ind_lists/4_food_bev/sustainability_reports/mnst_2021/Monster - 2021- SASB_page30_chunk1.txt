At AFF , water use is tracked for total volume con-
sumption and is broken down into three usages: (i) 
finished product usage, (ii) effluent water and (iii) 
process equipment water consumable for boilers, 
cooling towers and refrigeration condensers. Be-
cause of the nature of AFF’s business, it does not 
use recycled water in its facilities and instead uses 
100 percent source municipal water from the city 
of Los Angeles. Water quality is checked through 
both in-house testing and use of annual water 
quality reports for the Los Angeles County Water -
works District. Effluent parameters, such as pH and 
total discharge, are also monitored.AFF - A Cycle of Efficiency
AS PART OF THE RESOURCE-EFFICIENT DESIGN, OUR NEW AFF PRODUCTION 
FACILITY WILL INCLUDE AN ANAEROBIC FLUIDIZED BED DIGESTER SYSTEM. 
THIS INNOVATIVE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE BIOLOGICAL 
OXYGEN DEMAND (BOD) LEVELS BY 80 PERCENT AND TOTAL SUSPENDED 
SOLIDS (TSS) BY AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT FROM WASTEWATER. A 
COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM PRODUCING ELECTRICITY AND 
STEAM FOR USE WITHIN THE AFF FACILITY WILL BE PARTIALLY FUELED 
FROM BIOGAS GENERATED BY THE ANAEROBIC FLUIDIZED BED DIGESTER 
SYSTEM AND WILL ULTIMATELY HELP REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AS 
WELL, CREATING A CYCLE OF EFFICIENCY THROUGHOUT ITS OPERATIONS. 
THE WASTEWATER FROM THE FACILITY WILL BE PROCESSED BY 
AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTER BEFORE BEING DISCHARGED TO THE CITY 
WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. IN THE FUTURE, ADDITIONAL 
FILTRATION PROCESSES MAY BE EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL USE AS GRAY 
WATER FOR LANDSCAPE IRRIGATION AND OTHER EXTERNAL USES
