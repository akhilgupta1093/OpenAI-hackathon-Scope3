In EMEA, we continue to investigate ways to in-
crease our use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) 
certified paperboard, and certain markets and part-
ners utilize FSC grade paperboard exclusively. We 
are also evaluating our stretch wrap and shrink film 
to increase their levels of recycled content. 
Our key packaging suppliers are leaders in the use 
of recycled content materials and in the promotion 
of recycling. In 2021, we collaborated with several supply partners to expand lightweighting efforts 
and significantly reduced the amount of material 
required to deliver our products to consumers. 
Using recycled aluminum to manufacture new 
cans requires 95 percent less electricity than virgin 
primary metal. Currently, recycled content levels in 
Monster Energy cans range from 62-73 percent. We 
are striving to ensure that all of our packaging is 
recycled and have implemented extensive recycling 
efforts at most of our office locations to promote 
recycling internally as well
