We also encourage our team members to explore 
their philanthropic passions by providing each full-
time member of the Monster Family with one paid 
volunteer day off per year to work with their cho-
sen charities. We are proud of our team members 
who hold positions of leadership throughout the 
community and donate their time, expertise and fi-
nancial resources to an array of initiatives. In 2021, 
U.S. team members completed more than 1,300 
hours of volunteer work. In EMEA, team members 
completed almost 350 hours
