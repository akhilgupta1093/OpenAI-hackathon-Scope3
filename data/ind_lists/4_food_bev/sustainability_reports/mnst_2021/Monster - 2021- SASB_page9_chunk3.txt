In late 2021, Monster also conducted a review of 
commercially-available ESG software to enhance data collection and analysis. As a result, we en-
gaged a leading ESG software developer who 
created a bespoke data collection tool for Mon-
ster: EcoBeast™. EcoBeast™ will allow us to mea-
sure and manage ESG data for our bottlers and 
co-packers, as well as our own operations. Monster 
is committed to obtaining supplier metrics through 
EcoBeast™, starting in late 2022 and continuing in 
2023
