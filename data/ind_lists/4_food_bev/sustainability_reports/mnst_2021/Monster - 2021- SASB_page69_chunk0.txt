MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT67EXECUTiVE 
COMPENSATiON
Our executive compensation program is designed 
to reinforce ownership and overall entrepreneurial-
ism, and to link rewards to measurable corporate 
and qualitative individual performance. The pro-
gram’s primary objectives are to:
 ›Motivate and retain executive talent;
 ›Reward executives fairly over time for perfor -
mance relative to business plan goals; and
 ›Create sustainable stockholder value through 
continued profitable growth. 
The executive compensation program is overseen 
by the Board of Directors’ Compensation Commit-
tee, which is comprised entirely of independent 
directors. In 2021, we continued the implementation of our 
revamped executive compensation program, which 
is more objective than our historical approach to 
the program. Each of our named executive officers 
(NEO) once again had a pre-established target 
bonus opportunity as part of our annual incen-
tive award (AIA) program for short-term annual 
incentive compensation. In addition to the AIAs, 
the Compensation Committee approved long-
term annual incentive compensation, specifically 
grants of performance share units (PSUs), which are 
the Company’s first grants of PSUs eligible to be 
earned based on the Company’s three-year cumu-
lative adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) 
from 2021 through 2023, together with time-vest-
ed stock options and time-vested restricted stock 
units to all of our NEOs.
