AND DEVELOPMENT
Monster empowers team members to perform at 
their highest potential. To foster this growth, we 
offer many opportunities for team members to 
take their skills and careers to the next level. 
Mentorship
We offer mentorship programs which are de-
signed to inspire, motivate and guide talent 
within our operations. From 2020 to 2021 alone, 
Monster saw a 25 percent increase in the num-
ber of program participants in the Americas, 
APAC and LATAM regions. Approximately 600 
team members participated in this program in 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, a global 
committee reviewed all steps in the annual mentor 
program with the aim to enhance the program. 
In December 2021, the committee provided final 
recommendations for 2022, including the addition 
of EDI criteria in the application process and the 
inclusion of peer-to-peer mentoring for new hires 
to accelerate the onboarding process
