For the 2021 World Oceans Day, EMEA teams 
worked with our bottling partner, Coca-Cola 
European Partners, on their project Mares Circu-
lares, or “Circular Seas.” A total of 97 employees 
across nine countries spent the day participating in 
marine clean-ups to help protect our oceans from plastic pollution. Over 300 kilograms of waste was 
collected in Spain alone as part of this initiative. 
U.S. teams were also involved in World Oceans 
Day clean-ups, with 25 team members working at 
the Chattahoochee River in Atlanta and five more 
at the Ohio River in Louisville. Additionally, we de-
veloped a video with the theme, What Does Water 
Mean to You? to encourage team members to think 
consciously about this resource, and shared water 
efficiency tips that could be easily implemented at 
home, including information on incentives offered 
by local government and utilities for water-efficient 
equipment purchases.
