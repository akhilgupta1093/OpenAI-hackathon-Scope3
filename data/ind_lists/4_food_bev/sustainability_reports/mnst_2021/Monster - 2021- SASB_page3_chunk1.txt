In 2021, meaningful efforts were made to measure 
and report energy use and greenhouse gas emis-
sions across our value chain. Building upon these 
efforts, we are committed to setting a target by the 
end of 2023 to reduce our environmental impacts. 
In addition, planning began across our facilities 
to test and implement additional energy efficien-cy solutions. Plans for the new American Fruits 
& Flavors LLC (AFF) production facility include a 
combined heat and power system partially fueled 
by solar energy and biogas from an anaerobic 
digester, as well as ENERGY STAR® and LEED™ 
Certification. By 2023, solar panels will be installed 
on our Corona, CA, headquarters buildings and on 
our 1,000,000-square-foot Monster Energy ware-
house in Rialto, CA. These projects demonstrate 
our commitment to a sustainable future. 
Our commitment to a sustainable future is further 
demonstrated through our products you see in 
the marketplace. We have committed to supplying 
our vendors with ENERGY STAR certified refriger -
ation equipment. In 2021, 97 percent of Monster 
products were packaged in 100 percent recyclable 
aluminum cans
