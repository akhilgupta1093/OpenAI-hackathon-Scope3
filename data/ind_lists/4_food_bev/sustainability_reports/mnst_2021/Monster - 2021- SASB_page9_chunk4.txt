On February 17, 2022, we completed the acqui-
sition of CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC 
(CANarchy), a craft beer and hard seltzer company. 
CANarchy will function independently, retaining its 
own organizational structure. This report does not 
cover CANarchyâ€™s ESG activities, as the acquisition 
closed in the 2022 calendar year. We recognize 
that our growth into alcoholic beverages brings 
new responsibilities, and we will address these 
issues in future reports
