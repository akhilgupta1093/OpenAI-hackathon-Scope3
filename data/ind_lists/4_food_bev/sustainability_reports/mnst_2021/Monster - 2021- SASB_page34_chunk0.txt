MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT32Working Together on Water
Although many of our offices remained closed 
throughout 2021, that did not stop us from seek-
ing everyday solutions on how we can positively 
contribute to solving water-related issues. In 2021, 
for the first time, Monster engaged with Living 
Lands & Waters, a nonprofit that aids in the pro-
tection, preservation and restoration of the natural 
environment of the nationâ€™s major rivers and their 
watersheds. We donated to the organization with 
the support of our employee match program and 
allowed our employees to use their Volunteer Time 
Off day to participate in river and shore clean-up 
activities. In addition, on Earth Day, Living Lands & Waters Founder and President, Chad Pregracke, 
spoke to our company team members as part of 
our Monster speaker series
