Athlete Charities
Monster is proud to sponsor some of the most 
talented athletes on the planet. While these ath-
letes have won numerous championships in their 
respective sports, we are equally impressed by their 
commitment to helping those in need. Paul Thacker 
is one such Monster athlete who was paralyzed in 
a snowmobile accident in 2010. After surviving this 
accident, he started the Paul Dean Thacker Spinal 
Cord Recovery Foundation to help fund research 
focused on finding cures for spinal cord injuries. 
Thacker also runs a program that hosts Veterans at 
backcountry snowmobiling, utility task vehicle (UTV) 
and fly-fishing events to aid in their battlefield 
recovery. We donate to his foundation each year 
and are proud to work with someone as resilient as 
Thacker.
