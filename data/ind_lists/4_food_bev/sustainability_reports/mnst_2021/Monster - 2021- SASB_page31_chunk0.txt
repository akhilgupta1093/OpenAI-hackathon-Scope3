MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT29APPROACH TO OUR 
WATER ACCOUNTiNG
Monster completed its annual water inventory for 
direct operations for 2021. Some of our sites — mainly 
our AFF production facilities — have metered water 
withdrawal and discharge. For these facilities, usage is 
based on empirical data from utility bills. To estimate 
water withdrawal and discharge at our non-metered 
sites, we calculated the average intensity based on 
square footage and facility type (e.g., production fa-
cility or office) using data from our metered sites. We 
were able to improve the quality of our data this year, 
and we aim to keep improving in future years
