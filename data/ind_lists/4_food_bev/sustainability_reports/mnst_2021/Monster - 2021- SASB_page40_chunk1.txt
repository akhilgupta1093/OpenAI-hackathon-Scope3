Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we conduct-
ed pulse surveys to evaluate team member morale, 
created wellness hotlines and introduced incentive 
bonuses for essential workers. Additional programs 
that were implemented in 2020 and continued 
through 2021 include:
 ›“Beast Your Day”– A resilience training program 
providing team members with tools and resourc-
es to be resilient in the current climate, to stay 
healthy and to focus on “you.”
 ›Monster Legends Speaker Series – A series 
accessible to all team members covering a wide 
range of important and relevant topics, includ-
ing motivation, equality, diversity and inclusion, 
sustainability, wellness and resilience. 
As part of EMEA’s Family Matters Community and 
Well-being Program, we implemented female- and 
male-specific health talks that covered topics such 
as gender-specific cancers and lifestyle behavior 
changes
