MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT17Reuse
 ›U.S. — Our kitchens have switched from polysty-
rene to recyclable containers, and almost all  our 
single-use tableware is compostable. In 2021, we 
installed refillable water stations at our Coro-
na offices so that team members can fill their 
reusable water bottles throughout the day. This 
project is estimated to eliminate over 750,000 
plastic bottles annually and will help transition 
the elimination of single-use plastic water bottles 
on our corporate site. We plan to expand upon 
this in 2022 by providing all office-based team 
members in North America with refillable water 
containers
