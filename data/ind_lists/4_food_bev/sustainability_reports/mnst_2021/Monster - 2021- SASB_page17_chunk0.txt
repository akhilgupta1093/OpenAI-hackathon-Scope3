MANUFACTURING STRATEGY
Monsterâ€™s ingredients and products often travel 
long distances, as our freight partners transport 
them from procurement sites to separate manu-
facturing, co-packing, bottling or distribution sites. 
Longer miles spent on the road can equate to high-
er costs and negative environmental impacts
