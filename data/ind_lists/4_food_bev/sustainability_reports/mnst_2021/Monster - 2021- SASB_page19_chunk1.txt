 ›EMEA — Our U.K. team has developed several 
environmentally conscious initiatives that incor -
porate sustainable sourcing and the principles of 
reuse, reduce and recycle. For example, the team 
salvages cardboard from inbound shipments 
or waste products (e.g., bean bags) to use for 
outbound shipments in instances where reused 
packaging is acceptable. The team also uses 
pressed wood pallets that are made from recycla-
ble materials.
