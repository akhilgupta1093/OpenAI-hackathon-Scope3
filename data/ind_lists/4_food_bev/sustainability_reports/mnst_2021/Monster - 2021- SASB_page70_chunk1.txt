Our objective is to prove that Monster competes 
fairly and with integrity. Team members should not 
take any anti-competitive actions which may violate 
antitrust or competition laws, such as entering into 
an agreement or understanding with a competitor 
to set prices, coordinate bids, divide markets or 
obtain competitive information in an illegitimate 
way. 
We aim to comply with all national and local 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. The com-
pany prohibits its employees from paying, giving, 
offering, promising or authorizing the payment or 
the giving of money or anything of value to gov-
ernment officials in order to assist in obtaining, 
retaining or directing business. Monster’s anti-brib-
ery and anti-corruption policy and procedures are 
overseen by the company’s Compliance Officer.
