MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT9
Outsourced Manufacturing Operations
In 2021, as in previous years, we did not oper -
ate our own manufacturing facilities for finished 
goods, but rather outsourced the manufacturing 
process for finished goods to third-party bottlers 
and contract packers throughout the U.S. and 
abroad, under separate arrangements with each 
party. Our products were generally manufactured 
regionally in domestic and international locations, 
in or near the markets where they are sold. This 
strategy reduces freight costs and transporta-
tion-related product damages, as well as our 
carbon footprint. 
While we aim to keep manufacturing and sales 
within the same regions, due to supply chain issues 
that occurred throughout 2021, some aluminum 
cans were imported to meet regional demand. In 
addition, in 2021, some manufacturing had to take 
place outside of certain sales regions to satisfy 
consumer demand, which led to less efficiency
