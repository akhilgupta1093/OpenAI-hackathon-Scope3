WATER RiSK ASSESSMENT
Water is a key ingredient in our products, and 
we are taking measures to ensure its responsible 
stewardship. We are taking a variety of actions to 
understand the water-related risks within both our 
direct and indirect operations. In Our Operations
To better understand our water impacts, we have 
conducted a water risk assessment covering our 
direct operations using credible, publicly available 
tools such as the WWF Water Risk Filter and the 
World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool. 
These tools allow us to assess how water risk and 
water stress occurring at the baseline level may 
affect operations and evaluate risk over a variety of 
factors, including physical, regulatory and reputa-
tional indicators. A total of 66 domestic and inter -
national sites within our operational control were 
assessed using the geographic coordinates of each 
site as inputs. Excluding AFF , the sites considered 
were non-manufacturing and were limited only to 
sites that are considered employee workspaces 
(e.g., offices). The scope also did not include sites 
within our operational control that had a high likeli-
hood of no water usage (e.g., storage containers)
