In partnership with Mystery Ranch, Monster and 
Monster Energy Cares sponsored the creation of 
a book about California firefighters — Moon Dust 
— in 2021. Moon Dust is a collection of imag-
es shot over four years by photographer Rob-
ert LeBlanc documenting hotshot firefighters in 
Montana and California. One hundred percent of 
the proceeds from the book sales will be donated 
to help the Eric Marsh Foundation, the U.S. Hot-
shot Association and the Mystery Ranch Backbone 
Scholarship.
