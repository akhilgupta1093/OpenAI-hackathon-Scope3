We also have agreements with bottlers/distribu-
tors to distribute our products. All distribution ter -
ritories in the U.S. and the majority of distribution 
territories internationally have been transitioned 
to The Coca-Cola CompanyÂ® system of bottlers/
distributors. 
As a result, Monster relies in large part on The 
Coca-Cola Company system of bottlers/distribu-
tors and other third parties for certain information 
in this report. We also engage with these third 
parties in their sustainability efforts.
