Our Scope 1 (direct) GHG emission sources are 
from natural gas and heating oil; diesel from semi 
tractors; propane from forklifts; as well as diesel, 
ethanol, liquified petroleum gasoline (LPG) and 
gasoline from our owned fleet. Our Scope 2 (indi-
rect) GHG emissions are from electricity and have 
been calculated using the location-based method, 
which reflects the average emission intensity of 
grids on which energy consumption occurs. *Landfill and incineration from U.S., Canada, Netherlands, and 
Spain only;**For EMEA and APAC regions only
