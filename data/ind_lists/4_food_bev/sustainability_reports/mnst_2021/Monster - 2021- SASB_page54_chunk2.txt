EMEA CHARITY WALK
In December 2021, team members across EMEA 
came together — both figuratively and literally 
— to participate in a walk on the same day to 
raise money for charity. Team members could raise 
money collectively for their region’s chosen charity, 
or for another charity of their choice, and Monster 
matched all donations. We were proud of the great 
turnout despite the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 
in 2021.
