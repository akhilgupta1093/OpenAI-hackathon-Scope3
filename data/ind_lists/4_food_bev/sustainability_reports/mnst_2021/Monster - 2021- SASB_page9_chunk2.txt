In 2021, Monster did not manufacture any of its 
finished products. Instead, we outsourced pro-
duction to third-party bottlers and co-packers. As 
in previous years, Monster engaged with select 
bottling and supply partners regarding a broad 
range of sustainability metrics, goals and perfor -
mance related to their activities with Monster, in 
order to better understand ESG impacts beyond 
our own direct operations. Highlights are included 
throughout this report, and we look forward to 
communicating our progress on such engagements 
in future years
