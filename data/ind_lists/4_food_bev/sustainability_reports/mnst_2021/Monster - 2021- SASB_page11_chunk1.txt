We own our primary flavor supplier, AFF , which 
manufactures flavors and concentrates for many of 
our beverages. We also procure flavors and other 
raw materials, such as concentrates, sweeteners, sugar, tea, cocoa, juices and other ingredients 
from third party suppliers. In addition, we obtain 
packaging materials such as aluminum cans, bot-
tles, caps, labels, trays and boxes from third-par -
ty suppliers, which are delivered to our various 
third-party bottlers and co-packers. 
In some cases, certain common supplies may be 
purchased by third-party bottlers and co-packers. 
Water and other ingredients may be added into 
our approved containers for the manufacture of 
the finished products in accordance with our rec-
ipes and formulas. Depending on the beverage, 
carbonation may also be added
