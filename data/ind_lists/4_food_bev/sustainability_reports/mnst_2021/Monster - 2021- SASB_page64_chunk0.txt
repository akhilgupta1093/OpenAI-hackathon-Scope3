Supporting Industry Efforts to 
Increase Circularity of Packaging
Monster encourages and supports industry efforts 
to enhance the circularity of packaging. Several of 
our suppliers, including Ball Corporation (Ball), are 
actively incorporating circularity into their manu-
facturing processes. 
In 2021, Monster Energy Sustainability Task Force 
members participated in seminars and meetings 
with Ball to discuss collaboration to expand light-
weighting efforts, to increase the use of recycled 
cans in the can manufacturing process, and to 
improve levels of recycling of aluminum cans. We 
are committed to looking for further opportunities 
to expand lightweighting efforts to reduce the 
amount of material required to deliver our prod-
ucts to consumers.In addition, Ball’s comparative life cycle assessment 
challenges the traditional ways sustainability has 
been measured in the beverage packaging indus-
try. The methodology compares real recycling data 
for four of the most popular beverage packaging 
materials – aluminum, PET, glass and cartons – 
across three key geographies: the U.S., Europe and 
Brazil
