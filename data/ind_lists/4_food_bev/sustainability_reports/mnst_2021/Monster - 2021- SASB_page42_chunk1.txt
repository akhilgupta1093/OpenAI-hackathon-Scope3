Monster Business Academy
The Monster Business Academy provides team 
members with access to numerous online, self-
paced, on-demand courses and training programs, 
as well as leadership training sessions designed to 
build management and professional skills. In 2021, 
22 team members participated in the program at 
Vanderbilt or Cornell University with the aim to 
promote fresh perspectives for our organization’s 
future success. In a feedback survey sent out to 
participants after the program’s completion, 92 
percent of respondents stated that they are likely 
to recommend the program to other members of 
the Monster Family. Great job putting it all 
together and tailoring it to 
the Monster team. It is not 
easy to bring all the egos, 
palates, opinions, (and) 
experience levels together 
and adding in outside 
influences like professors 
and other companies. 
Overall, it was a fantastic 
experience and especially 
great for us all to be 
together in person
