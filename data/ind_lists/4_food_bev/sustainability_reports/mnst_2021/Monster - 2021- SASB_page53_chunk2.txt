In 2021, we celebrated our 11th anniversary of 
support for this charity, and engaged Adam Fu, 
a graffiti street artist and Monster talent from 
Brooklyn, to design our bike kits and to paint a 
mural at the event which served as a great back-
drop for photos. To date, Team Monster Energy 
has raised $1.25 million for this charity
