MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT20OUR SOLAR PROJECT
In 2021, Monster approved a project to install 
solar panels on the Corona headquarters build-
ings, Rialto warehouse and new AFF San Fer -
nando site. With an expected capacity of 3.46 
megawatts, the system will save approximately 
4,100 metric tons (MT) carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO2e) in annual GHG emissions. This projected 
reduction represents over 88 percent of total 
Scope 2 emissions for all Monster direct opera-
tions in 2021
