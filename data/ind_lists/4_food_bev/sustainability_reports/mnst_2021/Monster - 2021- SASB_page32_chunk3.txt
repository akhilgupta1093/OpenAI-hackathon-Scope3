Findings from the assessment showed that a few 
AFF sites in Southern California and Monster sites 
and offices in India and Brazil operate in areas with 
high water stress. We have made investments in 
water-efficient equipment for AFF (SASB FB-NB-
140a.2), and we plan to improve upon our data col-
lection efforts to further validate the results of our 
water risk assessment. This assessment will serve as 
an important step in identifying specific water risk sources within our operations so that Monster can 
better mitigate and manage our water footprint 
(SASB FB-NB-140a.2). 
In Our Supply Chain
A substantial component of our water footprint 
comes from indirect water use consumed in the 
manufacture of our products. One of the ways we 
manage these risks is by requiring suppliers to 
adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct (SASB 
FB-NB-140a.2). In 2021, we began initial assess-
ments of our water-related trends in our supply 
chain through publicly available reports, data and 
tools. We conducted a water risk assessment on 
our co-packer and bottler facilities located in the 
EMEA using the WRI Aqueduct tool and the WWF 
Water Risk Filter. Out of the 21 sites assessed, 8 
sites were identified to be in high water risk areas. 
To address water stewardship opportunities and 
water-related risks, our EMEA team has created a 
cross-functional water team, and we will continue 
to work closely with our bottling partners to drive 
increased water efficiency. 
Monster is committed to expanding our water 
risk assessment to include CANarchy and all of 
our bottling and co-packer partners
