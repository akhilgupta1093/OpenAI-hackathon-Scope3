The largest building at our corporate headquarters 
in Corona, California, is LEED and ENERGY STAR 
certified. The second largest building at our cor -
porate headquarters is currently pursuing ENERGY 
STAR certification. Our Southern California ware-
house and distribution center in Rialto, California, 
is certified LEED Silver. 
As part of our benchmarking efforts for ENERGY 
STAR certification of our facilities, we have installed 
energy-efficient lighting and control systems, 
upgraded our heating, ventilation and air condi-
tioning (HVAC) systems and installed commercial 
window film shades. 
In line with our vision to minimize our environmen-
tal impact, we have taken steps to incorporate the 
use of renewable energy. With the increase in use 
of electric vehicles, we operate electric vehicle charging stations at both our corporate head-
quarters and our warehouse in Rialto, California; 
specifically, we currently have 7 charging stations 
at our Corona headquarters and are planning to 
have 22 more by 2023. We are also implementing 
a project to install solar panels and solar-powered 
electric vehicle chargers at our corporate head-
quarters with the aim of installing solar panels for 
our Rialto, Corona and AFF sites by 2023
