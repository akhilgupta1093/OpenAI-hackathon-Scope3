 ›EDI Survey: At the end of 2021, the EDI EMEA 
Council delivered its first EDI survey to measure 
the pulse of team members across the region on 
topics that mattered to them. Eighty-four percent 
of colleagues provided personal insight into how 
EDI contributes to the well-being, growth and 
success of the organization. The survey provided 
insight into how the council will need to evolve 
and develop in future years.SUPPLiER CODE OF CONDUCT
Monster is committed to conducting business re-
sponsibly and under the highest ethical standards. 
We hold our directors, officers and team members 
to these standards, guided by our Code of Busi-
ness Conduct and Ethics. This commitment also 
extends to all our suppliers. Our Supplier Code of 
Conduct outlines our expectations for our suppli-
ers’ operations and their employees and reflects 
our respect for international human rights. We en-
courage our suppliers to work towards implement-
ing best practices and to exceed the requirements 
of our Supplier Code of Conduct. Adherence to 
the Supplier Code of Conduct is a contractual re-
quirement. Currently, approximately 57 percent of 
our existing supplier contracts include this require-
ment, and we continue to incorporate this require-
ment into new supplier contracts
