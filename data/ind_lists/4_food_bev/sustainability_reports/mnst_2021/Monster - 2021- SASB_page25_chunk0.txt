MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT23GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMiSSiONS 
We completed our second GHG emissions inven-
tory covering data for calendar year 2021. The 
inventory follows the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Standard, one of the most widely used GHG 
accounting standards for businesses, and serves 
as a key tool for us to measure, develop, imple-
ment and track energy efficiency and emissions 
reduction activities. In addition, we have expanded 
the scope of our inventory to account for emis-
sions associated with segments of our value chain 
activities (Scope 3). We have outlined the relevant 
sources for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our 
global direct operations in addition to several 
Scope 3 categories. 
We would like to note that our emissions account-
ing methodology, specifically our approach to esti-
mating square footage and emissions for facilities 
that do not have data, has changed this reporting 
year. Rather than applying 2,500 square feet to 
all facilities that have unknown areas, the average 
square footage per facility type was applied. For 
facilities that do not have data but have known 
energy and electricity consumption, Commercial 
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) Gross Greenhouse Gas EmissionsGross Greenhouse Gas Emissions 20212021
