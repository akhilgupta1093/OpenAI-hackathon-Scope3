Asahi has taken many positive steps to reduce their environmental 
impacts including:
 ›Switched to renewable energy in April 2021 at the Gunma 
factory, which produces for Monster, joining other Asahi 
plants that also use renewable energy. As a result, Asahi 
has reduced the amount of purchased electricity at the 
domestic group facilities by approximately 40 percent. 
 ›Set science-based targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050
