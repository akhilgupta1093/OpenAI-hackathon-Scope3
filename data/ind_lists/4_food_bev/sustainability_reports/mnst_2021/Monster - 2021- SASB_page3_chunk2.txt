In 2021, we welcomed Tiffany M. Hall and Ana 
Demel to our Board of Directors. Our Equality, 
Diversity and Inclusion councils have raised aware-
ness and reinforced our values throughout the 
organization. We supported our local communities 
through impactful organizations like the United 
Service Organization (USO) and Thanks USA, through our amazing Monster athletes and their 
charities, and with the generosity of Monster 
team members volunteering their time around 
the world. 
As we welcome CANarchy into the fold, we’re 
excited for the changes they’ll bring. We’re 
also continuing to work with our distributors, 
bottlers and co-packers to measure their sus-
tainability performance through the use of Ec-
oBeast™, our centralized environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) software platform. These 
programs are helping us set a solid foundation 
for transparency, accountability and goal-set-
ting in the future
