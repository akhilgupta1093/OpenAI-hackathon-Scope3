Over the last few years, we have implemented an 
Employee Crisis Response program, from which all 
team members can benefit. Through this initiative, 
we try to help team members and their families in 
need due to unforeseen or extreme circumstances. 
Team members experiencing significant personal 
or financial hardship under extreme circumstanc-
es, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can receive 
monetary assistance from Monster to help address 
those challenges. In 2021, 10 individuals in the 
US and LATAM received financial aid through this 
program.
