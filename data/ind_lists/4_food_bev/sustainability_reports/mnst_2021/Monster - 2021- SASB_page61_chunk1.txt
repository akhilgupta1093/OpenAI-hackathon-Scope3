Our pursuit toward quality remains unabated. We aim to follow the standards on drinking water set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. The vast majority of our beverages use water that has been treated with a reverse osmosis system. Additionally, contract manufacturers undergo a thorough validation 
process to ensure adherence with our strict quality guidelines, and we sample products throughout the manufacturing process
