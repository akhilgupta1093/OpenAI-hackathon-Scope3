UNITED SERVICES ORGANIZATION (USO) PARTNERSHIP
For 14 years, Monster Energy Cares has proudly 
supported the USO, which provides programs, ser -
vices and live entertainment to U.S. service mem-
bers and their families. To date, our company has 
been represented in seven USO tours, accompa-
nied by Monster athletes and celebrities in support 
of our troops. In previous years, we were awarded 
the “Legacy of Hope” award for recognition of our 
involvement with the nation’s largest USO chap-
ter. We continued our support for USO in 2021 by providing products for their activities in the 
United States, Middle East, and Europe. In Decem-
ber 2021, Monster supported the USO’s themed 
“Military Medical Heroes” awards dinner held in 
Washington DC by providing funding; our V.P . of 
Philanthropy also proudly attended the event
