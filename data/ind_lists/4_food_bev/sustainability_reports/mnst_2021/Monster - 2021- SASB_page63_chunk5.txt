Outside of our direct operations, we encourage 
recycling of our products and take part in recycling 
programs with consumers. As examples, we have 
partnered with Pocono Raceway and NASCAR 
Green for several years for the “Monster Energy 
NASCAR Free Friday” program. At this event, fans 
received free access to a day of on-track events 
by bringing an empty can of Monster Energy for 
recycling. We have also run similar promotions for 
many American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) Supercross events. Because of COVID-19-related 
restrictions for large public gatherings, these pro-
grams did not occur in 2021, but we continue to 
explore creative ways in which we can engage with 
our customers on environmental topics. 
To encourage our consumers to participate in the 
circular economy, we continued with the inclu-
sion of our Monster Energy recycling logo on 
cans. We are also supportive of the aluminum can 
industry’s long-term efforts to increase recycled 
content levels to 85 percent and recycling rates 
to 90 percent. Our primary distribution partners, 
members of The Coca-Cola System, have commit-
ted to recycle 100 percent of the packaging they 
deliver to the market. Over the next few years, we 
will continue to seek additional opportunities to 
collaborate with suppliers and bottling partners 
and pursue innovations to enhance sustainability of 
all packaging put into the hands of our consumers
