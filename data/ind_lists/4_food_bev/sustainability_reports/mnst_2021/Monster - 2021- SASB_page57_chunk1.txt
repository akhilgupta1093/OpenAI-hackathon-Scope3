First Responders
First responders are among the bravest people we 
know. They work around the clock to ensure our 
communities are safe and protected. We provide 
donations of our products to first responders, 
including police officers, firefighters, paramedics, 
hospital workers and SWAT team members. We 
also sponsor events commemorating the sacrifices 
first responders make on a daily basis
