MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT22
ENERGY USE 
We consume electricity in our buildings in many 
ways, including lighting, climate control and equip-
ment use. Other direct and indirect energy sources, 
such as natural gas, diesel and propane, are used 
to heat our buildings, power equipment and run 
our vehicle fleet. When calculating our global en-
ergy consumption from direct and indirect sources, 
we used utility invoices for electricity and natural 
gas consumption and transactional records for fuel 
consumption. For sites in which square footage 
data was unavailable, we have applied an average 
square footage by facility type to estimate the size of the facility before estimating the energy 
consumption
