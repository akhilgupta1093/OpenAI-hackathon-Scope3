Regarding Scope 3, we have calculated the 
emissions associated with our purchased com-
modities and cans (Category 1, or C1, purchased 
goods and services); waste generated in opera-
tions (C5); business travel (C6); and downstream 
transportation and distribution (C8). Emissions 
from our purchased goods and services rep-
resents emissions from our top 20 commodities 
by spend. Emissions from downstream transpor -
tation represent Monster-to-retailer emissions for 
EMEA and APAC. This was our first year of devel-
oping a Scope 3 inventory and we plan to expand 
our tracking efforts in the future by accounting 
for additional sources and Scope 3 value chain 
emissions. We are committed to completing a full 
Scope 3 GHG inventory by the end of 2023.1
1  Scope 3 emissions tend to be subject to measurement uncertainties resulting 
from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such 
data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result 
in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement 
techniques may also vary.2021 Greenhouse Gas Emissions 2021 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
