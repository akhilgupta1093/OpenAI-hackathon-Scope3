American Humane Societyâ€™s Pups4Patriots program 
rescues qualified shelter dogs and trains them to 
offer the best possible assistance to Veterans with 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Trau-
matic Brain Injury (TBI). This program was support-
ed by Monster through our donation to the Ameri-
can Humane Society in 2021. We also donated toward a study of PTSD carried 
out by University of California, Irvine and the Long 
Beach Veterans Association
