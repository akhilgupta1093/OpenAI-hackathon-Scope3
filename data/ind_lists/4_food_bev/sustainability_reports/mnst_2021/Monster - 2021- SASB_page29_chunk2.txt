We recognize that access to clean, safe drinking 
water is under growing threat from Californiaâ€™s on-
going drought; therefore, we must aim to become 
better stewards of our water use across our busi-
ness, in the supply chain and in our personal lives 
and encourage our key suppliers to do the same.iN OUR OPERATiONS
We participate in various water conservation pro-
grams sponsored by the city of Corona in order 
to expand water conservation efforts in a manner 
that positively affects our surrounding community. 
These programs include initiatives such as installa-
tion of low-flow toilets and minimizing the use of 
water for landscape irrigation. We are continually 
assessing the risks due to water scarcity in the state of California, and water optimization and conser -
vation will continue to be a key component of our 
sustainability strategy and goals. Monster will work 
to include water risk information in our reporting in 
the future (SASB FB-NB-140a.2)
