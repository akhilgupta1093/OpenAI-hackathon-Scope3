Our Solution 
We’ve regionalized manufacturing operations to 
reduce costs and the number of miles traveled. This 
way, we improved service by providing products 
closer to our customers while offering the same 
high quality in a resource efficient manner. 
While we aim to keep manufacturing and sales 
within the same regions, we do note that, due 
to supply chain issues and increasing consumer 
demand, we were not able to do so consistently in 
certain regions in 2021. We are working to become 
more efficient by engaging in the following proj-
ects.   RECENT PROJECTS:
