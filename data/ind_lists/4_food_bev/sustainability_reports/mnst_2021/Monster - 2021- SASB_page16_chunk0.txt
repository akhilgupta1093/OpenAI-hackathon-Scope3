MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION /  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT14
We are reporting environmental metrics and initia-
tives from not only our own operations, but also 
our key bottling and supply partners as determined 
by our ongoing engagement with them. 
As in previous years, we outsourced the manufac-
turing process for finished goods to third-party 
bottlers and contract packers in 2021. This Environ-
mental Section includes metrics and initiatives from 
our key bottling and supply partners as determined 
by our ongoing engagement with them. Many of 
our ingredient, commodity and packaging suppli-
ers and bottling partners have robust sustainable 
agriculture policies and programs. As we enhance 
data collection in our supply chain through EcoBe-
astâ„¢, we aim to better understand these programs 
and the environmental impacts in our supply chain.Increasing Sustainability
