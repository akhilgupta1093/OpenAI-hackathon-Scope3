Respect for human rights is one of our core values 
at Monster, and it is vital to conduct our business 
in a manner that respects and promotes human 
rights. Our Human Rights Policy is guided by the 
international human rights principles set forth by 
the United Nations in their Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights, and the International Labor Organi-
zationâ€™s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work. Our Human Rights Policy applies 
company-wide, regardless of location. We also 
expect our suppliers and distribution partners to 
uphold these principles and adopt similar policies 
within their own businesses
