WALKING WITH THE WOUNDED
Walking With The Wounded (WWTW) is a lead-
ing U.K. military charity which recognizes those 
who serve. Whether mentally, socially or physical-
ly wounded, WWTW helps to reignite Veteransâ€™ 
sense of purpose, allowing them to make a positive 
contribution again. In 2021, Monster financially 
supported WWTW, and our U.K. team joined them 
for part of their charity walk in October
