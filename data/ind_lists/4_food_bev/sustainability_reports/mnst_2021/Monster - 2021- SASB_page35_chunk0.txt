CLiMATE CHANGE RiSK
Monster identifies, evaluates and manages fluctu-
ating corporate-level risks through assessment and 
business continuity plans. Each business division 
assesses risk relative to its own range of business 
activities and has its own definition of what may be 
considered a substantive risk in their specific area. 
Generally, climate-related risks are assessed in the 
same way that business-level risks are identified 
and managed. 
As climate change continues to be a pressing issue 
for us and for many stakeholders and communities 
worldwide, Monster plans to conduct a climate-re-
lated scenario analysis within the coming years to 
better gauge how climate change affects our direct 
and indirect operations. We plan to share more on 
this topic in future reports.CDP DiSCLOSURE
CDP is one of the premier frameworks for com-
panies to disclose information on climate change, 
water security and forest-related metrics, impacts, 
risks and opportunities. 
In 2021, Monster completed its second CDP disclo-
sures for both the Climate Change and Water Se-
curity programs. Our scores of Awareness for both 
programs represent our knowledge of, and our 
impact on, climate change and water issues. We 
recognize these efforts as a significant step in our 
sustainability journey and have continued reporting 
to these programs in 2022
