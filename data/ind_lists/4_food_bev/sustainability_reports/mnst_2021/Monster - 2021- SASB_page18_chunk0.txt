HEADQUARTERS

make resource-conscious decisions. 
Reduce
 ›U.S. — Our corporate headquarters has histor -
ically partnered with Inland Empire (IE) Com-
muter, a commute incentivization/carpooling 
program of the Riverside County Transportation 
Commission and San Bernardino County Trans-
portation Authority. Because of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, the program was paused 
since many of our offices remained closed or had 
reduced occupancy during 2021. However, we 
continue to explore ways to reduce our carbon 
footprint associated with employee commuting.  ›EMEA – The team is working to change all light-
ing to light-emitting diode (LEDs) with timers 
and movement sensors which will help reduce 
unnecessary energy and electricity consumption. 
This has already been completed in our Corona 
offices.
