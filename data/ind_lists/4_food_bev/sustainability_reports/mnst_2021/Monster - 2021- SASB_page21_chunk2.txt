Collaborating with equipment suppliers as well as 
researching and implementing innovative ways to 
reduce energy use is an essential part of our future 
sustainability efforts. We recognize that we still 
have a tremendous opportunity to further reduce 
the climate impact of our equipment and will 
continue to push our energy conservation efforts 
forward.
