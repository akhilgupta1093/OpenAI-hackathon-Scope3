We have estimated the direct and indirect en-
ergy consumption for approximately half of our 
sites due to unavailability of data. We have also 
recalculated our energy consumption for 2020 
to be consistent with our current calculation 
methodology. On this basis, direct and indirect 
energy consumption decreased. While office 
closures from the ongoing COVID-19 pandem-
ic have contributed to a decrease in energy 
consumption at our office sites, our updated 
methodology has provided us with a more 
accurate estimation of year-over-year energy 
consumption changes.The Importance of Data:

FOR US, MEANINGFUL ACTION BEGINS WITH 
ESTABLISHING BASELINES. THAT IS WHY WE 
ARE WORKING TO ROLL OUT ECOBEAST™, OUR 
CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION SOFTWARE, 
ACROSS OUR DIRECT OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY 
CHAIN IN ORDER TO COLLECT ACCURATE, 
RELEVANT METRICS ON ESG TOPICS SUCH AS 
EMISSIONS, ENERGY AND WATER USAGE, HEALTH 
AND SAFETY, AND OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS. ECOBEAST™ WILL HELP US MAKE 
POSITIVE PROGRESS ON OUR ESG JOURNEY BY 
STREAMLINING OUR DATA COLLECTION PROCESS 
AND ENABLING US TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON 
THE COLLECTED DATA
