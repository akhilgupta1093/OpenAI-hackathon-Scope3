DAWSON’S PEAK
In 2021, Monster initiated a multi-year partnership 
with Dawson’s Peak, a charity organization founded 
by avid expeditioner (and financial advice guru) 
Matt Dawson. Through Project Seven for Soldiers, 
Dawson is attempting to set seven world records 
benefiting military Veterans by smashing four 
existing records — and setting three completely 
new ones. Dawson’s jaw-dropping itinerary in-
cludes a solo, unsupported trek across the Mojave 
Desert and Death Valley on foot; rowing across the 
Atlantic Ocean; a global circumnavigation flight; as 
well as the Explorer’s Grand Slam: summiting the 
highest peak on each of the seven continents, and 
skiing to both the North and South Poles. After 
two years of exploration and adventure, the epic 
quest will conclude with a motorbike ride across 
the Mojave Desert with honored U.S. Veterans, 
celebrities and Dawson himself. One hundred 
percent of the net proceeds will benefit Hope For 
The Warriors and the Gary Sinise Foundation. We encourage readers to follow Dawson as he pushes 
human boundaries in the world’s harshest environ-
ments and inspires us to pursue lives motivated by 
greater purpose and altruism
