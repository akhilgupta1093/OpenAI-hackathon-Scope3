CARES FOUNDATiON
Monster is proud to support the communities 
in which we operate. Our philanthropic effort is 
managed by our Vice President (V.P .) of Philanthro-
py through our Monster Energy Cares Foundation. 
Our philanthropic platforms include social responsi-
bility, as well as supporting active duty, injured and 
retired U.S. military personnel, Monster athletes 
and their charities, our local communities and first 
responders. In 2021, we continued to grow our 
social responsibility as a platform of Monster Ener -
gy Cares by developing three social responsibility 
teams globally who help oversee our engagements 
with charities and communities in need. We look 
forward to continuing to grow our social respon-
sibility program and reporting on our progress in 
future years.
