Monster is governed by a Board of Directors, a 
majority of whom are “independent,” as defined 
by SEC rules. We are guided by a written, publicly 
disclosed set of Corporate Governance Guidelines 
and a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.The Board of Directors has appointed certain 
committees to assist in its responsibilities, including 
an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate 
Governance Committee and a Compensation Com-
mittee. Each committee is composed entirely of 
independent directors and is guided by a written, 
publicly disclosed charter. In 2021, the Board of 
Directors amended and restated the charter for the 
Audit Committee. Updates include reviewing and
