LOCAL COMMUNiTY 
SUPPORT
Action at the local level can be a powerful driv-
ing force for positive change in our communities. 
We value and support many community outreach 
efforts. Examples in 2021 include:
 â€ºProviding multiple scholarships each year to 
local high school students through Soroptimist 
International and Corona and Norco Rotary
