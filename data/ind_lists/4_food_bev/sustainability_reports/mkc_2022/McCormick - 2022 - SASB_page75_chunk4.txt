We are also an active member of the Consumer Goods 
Forum, a group that brings together consumer goods 
retailers and manufacturers from all over the world to drive 
positive change.Strong relationships helped insulate our supply chains from 
the external shocks associated with COVID-19, but these 
relationships also helped McCormick quickly identify how to 
react to the pandemic in other ways and support our global 
community. Interventions at vanilla markets in Madagascar 
and technical trainings to help boost farmersâ€™ income helped 
preserve the health and wellbeing of the communities 
responsible for growing our ingredients. Once again, our PLP 
approach illustrated the connection between our community 
engagement and positive results for our business.ABOUT
