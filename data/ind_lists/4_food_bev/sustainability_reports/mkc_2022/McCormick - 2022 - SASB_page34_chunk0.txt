At the heart of McCormick’s Purpose and progress is the Power of People. 
Our shared values and commitment to each other help us bring global flavors 
and perspectives to life. We impact thousands of lives every day for the better 
– from providing healthy and nutritious products to consumers around the 
world to actively listening and supporting the needs of our global teams as we’ve worked to protect each other during the COVID-19 global health crisis. 
We’re championing a diverse and inclusive people-first culture by building 
strong networks to uplift each other and we’re proud to be a place where all 
people can thrive.—   OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
