PLP REPORT
We are currently fully focused on sustainably sourcing 
all five of our branded iconic products by 2025. However, 
as we begin to reach our targets, additional focus will be 
given to the next seven ingredients on our priority list: 
turmeric, cumin (and other Indian seeds), ginger, sage, 
cardamom, cloves and thyme.In addition to our herbs and spices supply chains, we have 
evaluated the risk of a number of ingredients we use in 
small quantities and, where required, taken measures 
to source them in a less resource-intensive, sustainable 
manner
