Ensuring Pay Equity
Since 2018, we’ve remained committed to our pay equity work and increasing 
transparency around this topic. Pay analysis shows that when controlling for grade 
representation in management and professional populations, women globally earn 
98 cents on the dollar. In the U.S., that number is 97 cents on the dollar, and in some 
countries, the number is higher than one dollar. When analyzing metrics for ethnicity, 
within the U.S., ethnically diverse talent earns more than one dollar. We’re committed to 
regular reviews of pay levels and pay equity to ensure that our processes and procedures 
are working as intended and are consistent across geographies. To date, we have 
completed our 2021 pay equity surveys and will further communicate our findings to 
employees within the first half of 2022
