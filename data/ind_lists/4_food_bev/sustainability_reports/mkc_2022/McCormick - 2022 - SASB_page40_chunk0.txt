OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORT
McCormick employs a number of recruiting strategies to attract diverse talent and remain a competitive and attractive 
employer. In 2021, 54% of new hires into professional level roles globally were female and, within the U.S., 
42% identified as Ethnically Diverse T alent. Annually, McCormick conducts a pay equity review to ensure that it 
remains competitive in the global marketplace. Project COMPETE is an example of how we’re working to create 
more competitive wage rates for our non-exempt employees. As part of this initiative, we’ve aligned our new hire pay 
rates to updated market data and have made salary adjustment recommendations to leadership to ensure existing 
employees are competitively aligned to the market. To date, we’ve also elevated manufacturing and distribution center 
wages by 12% to 15% in the U.S. and we continue to increase wages each year through our annual merit cycle. In 
our expansion efforts we’ve also built new plants, like the one we’ve recently unveiled in Peterborough, UK, and have 
accelerated our hiring to support our distribution center, hiring over 200 more employees in three months to ship and 
meet our record sales volume
