Quality Education
We are intent on achieving inclusive and quality 
education for all, evident through our extensive training 
and development offerings for employees and corporate 
initiatives such as having active development goals in our 
HR system for 95% of all connected global employees. 
Our support of quality education includes investments 
in local communities in Madagascar to restore primary 
schools and increase access to learning. We are proud 
to have exceeded our goal of a 50% increase in the 
number of McCormick Science Institute citations in 
professional literature. Founded in 1940, our Unsung 
Heroes scholarship, which recognizes athletes for unselfish 
team play and highlights the efforts of those who contribute 
to the success of their teams without acclaim, has awarded 
over $1.7 million to deserving student-athletes. We also 
offer scholarships to dependents of U.S. employees who 
have completed a minimum of two yearsâ€™ service with 
McCormick, and offer partial tuition reimbursement for 
employees
