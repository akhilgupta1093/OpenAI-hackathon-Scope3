PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
McCormick and its 14,000 global employees embody 
a spirit of giving and volunteerism, which serves as 
the backbone of the Company’s charitable efforts to 
support thriving, healthy communities where we live, 
work and operate. 
This year, we introduced McCormick’s new global 
Power of Giving umbrella brand in the U.S. to help 
us tell the full story about how McCormick and 
our employees give back to communities. We are 
broadening our 80% of employees participating 
in Charity Day goal to 80% of our employees 
participating in our Power of Giving program globally. 
To date, we’ve launched a new online giving platform 
that is currently being implemented in the U.S. As 
a result, fewer U.S. employees participated in 2021 . 
However, we fully expect to achieve our 2025 target 
as we roll out additional online giving solutions 
globally
