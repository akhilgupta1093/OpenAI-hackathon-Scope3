The policy also sets forth expectations of suppliers and 
McCormick’s commitment to engaging in reasonable due 
diligence and screening of customers and distributors to 
ensure compliance with laws that regulate international 
trade. Because McCormick believes that the ability to enforce 
a policy is as critical as the adoption of the policy, we have 
worked to regularly inform employees of the new policy 
and have encouraged those with questions on the policy to 
contact the Company’s Ethics Hotline
