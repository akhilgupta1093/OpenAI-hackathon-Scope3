OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORT
These strong results rank McCormick above best-in-
class global benchmarks for both engagement and 
enablement. We also identified areas for continued 
improvement and have prioritized actions to improve 
critical issues, including “Diversity, Inclusion & 
Respect, ” “Opportunities for Career Development” and 
“Employee Recognition and Improved Processes and 
Procedures. ”
These new surveys and listening efforts complement 
our existing Organizational Effectiveness function, 
responsible for enhancing employee communications, 
engagement and experience across the enterprise. 
For example, in 2018, McCormick introduced McFlex, 
an internal flexible workforce program to lessen our 
reliance on staffing agencies and better engage with 
employees directly. This program continues to foster 
a more productive and better-compensated flexible 
workforce that serves as a pool for potential full-time 
recruitment. In 2021, we introduced a new global 
working model called MyFlex, enabling employees in 
eligible roles the ability to work remotely up to 50% of 
their time over the course of a month. This approach 
will enable us to have work location flexibility and the 
opportunity to co-locate with colleagues either in our 
offices or at customer sites, leveraging coming together 
as collective and cross-functional teams
