In 2019 we set ambitious science-based goals to reduce 
emissions in our operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 20% 
and in our supply chain (Scope 3) by 16% from a 2015 
baseline. The latest science stresses the importance 
of limiting the rise of global temperatures to 1 .5°C to 
avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. In 
response to our environmental imperative and scientific consensus, we have elevated our existing goal and are 
committed to achieving a target of 1 .5°C in alignment 
with the Science Based Targets initiative and to achieve 
Net Zero by 2050. We must protect the natural balance 
that sustains our environment, farmers and customers, 
and as a result, nothing but the highest level of ambition 
should inform our emission reduction goals
