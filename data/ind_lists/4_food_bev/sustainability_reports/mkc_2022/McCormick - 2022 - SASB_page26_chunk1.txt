Ethics and compliance is the cornerstone of our 
commitment to integrity, honesty and transparency, 
allowing our Company to continuously advance as 
the global leader in flavor. We’re continuing along 
our path of improvement through increased and 
new employee communications, activities, trainings, 
policies and procedures to ensure ethical decision-
making and practices permeate our organization and 
the ecosystems where we operate.In 2021, we established our new Global Human 
Rights Policy. We hope it will set a new industry 
standard as we look to support our employees, 
business partners, customers and communities. 
Additionally, our Enterprise Compliance Group, 
established in 2019, oversees a dedicated Ethics 
and Compliance team, which seeks to further build 
our global ethics and compliance program. Its work 
includes oversight of assessing third parties for 
corruption risk, training employees to identify and 
report potential ethics and compliance violations, 
tracking and responding to incidents and monitoring 
and auditing compliance risks of the program. 
Additionally, we’ve further invested in our global 
ethics and compliance program by supporting 
employees on the team to become Certified 
Compliance and Ethics Professionals, both in the  
U.S. and internationally.—  ETHICS & COMPLIANCE
