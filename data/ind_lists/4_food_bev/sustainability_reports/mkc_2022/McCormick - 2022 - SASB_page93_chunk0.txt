PLP REPORT
McCormick promotes implementation of regenerative 
agricultural practices, which are a conservation and 
rehabilitation approach to farming systems. It promotes 
practices focusing on topsoil regeneration, increasing 
above and below ground soil health while maximizing 
water efficiency, enhancing the ecosystem and carbon 
sequestering. The overall objective is to strengthen 
the health and vitality of topsoil to improve farm 
resilience to climate change. As with all our farm and 
farming community programs, the first step was to conduct a baseline study of soil health. In 2020, we 
began rolling out soil testing on farms growing our five 
iconic raw materials, completing our key suppliersâ€™ 
baseline in 2021 . The results of the testing enabled us 
to identify areas for improvement in soil health and 
provide recommendations to suppliers and farmers on 
inputs and practices. As these are implemented, we 
will be tracking impact both on yield and soil health 
improvements.Regenerative Agriculture
McCormick has committed to ambitious goals to 
reduce our GHG emissions, in an effort to combat 
climate change. These include targets for Scope 3 
emissions, including the impact of agricultural activities 
in our supply chains. We have therefore partnered with Winrock Solutions to adapt existing carbon calculator 
tools for McCormick supply chains, which will measure 
the positive impact our sustainable sourcing programs 
have on GHG emissions reduction.Calculating Carbon on Farm1
