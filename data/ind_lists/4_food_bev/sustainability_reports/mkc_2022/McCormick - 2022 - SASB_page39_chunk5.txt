Interviews with individuals leaving the 
organization voluntarily who are ethnically 
diverse and/or women in positions Grade 63 
and above have also been conducted at or by 
senior levels to better understand the reasons for

of the data collection, analysis and solution 
identification.In 2021, our global participation rate was 79%-two percentage points higher than 2020.  
And our survey takeaways were exciting:In 2020, we conducted three COVID-19 surveys to understand how employees were feeling and what they wanted 
and needed as we navigated the pandemic. We asked our employees for their thoughts on topics like leadership 
communications, tools to manage stress, health and safety protocols and other topics important to them.  As a result of their feedback, we prioritized actions around strengthening culture at McCormick with clear and regular 
coaching and feedback from managers. We expanded INNOVATE.ALL and introduced Leadership Cafes and then 
Leadership Academy to invest in developing feedback, coaching and other skills for managers
