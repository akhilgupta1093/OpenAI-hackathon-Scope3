Our partnership with Used Cardboard Boxes (UCB) has 
helped to divert significant waste from our manufacturing 
operations. Used Cardboard Boxes manages waste at 
over 15 McCormick sites, implementing a solution to 
divert cardboard boxes to secondary markets resulting 
in cost savings and environmental benefits. Additionally, 
in Dallas, we divert organic waste from the landfill to a 
compost facility and in Atlanta, we recycle fiber drums 
by mixing them in with cardboard recycling. At our 
Springfield, Missouri, distribution center, we work with 
a third party to break down any unsold products into 
compostable material and packaging.Waste Management
