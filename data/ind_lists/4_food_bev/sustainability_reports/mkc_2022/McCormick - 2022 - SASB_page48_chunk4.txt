We also continue expanding our resources for 
underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities. 
We have partnered with the National Organization on 
Disability to launch our new disabilities awareness 
employee ambassador group, ADAPT (Abled and 
Disabled Associates Partnering T ogether). Our newest 
EAG, which launched in November 2021, focuses on 
providing a voice to employees who have visible and 
nonvisible disabilities as well as to the caregivers of family 
members with disabilities. Prior to its launch, several 
McCormick project teams were commissioned to research 
and recommend action steps for ADAPT to ensure that 
the group would support employee needs and align with 
McCormickâ€™s core values
