The Grown for Good standard covers the basics of 
all three pillars of the Grown for Good framework, 
which enables continuous improvement. To provide 
more flexibility to our suppliers while ensuring similar 
sustainable expectations in meeting our targets, 
McCormick allows the suppliers to implement the most 
suitable third-party verified sustainability standard on 
farm that is benchmarked FSA Silver-level and above. 
Such farm-level certification needs to be complemented 
by Sedex and SMETA at the factory level, and 
continuous improvement for community resilience.For example, for cinnamon in Indonesia, our partner 
determined that the FSA standard itself was most 
suitable for this particular supply chain and, in 2020, 
we received the world’s first Farm Sustainability 
Assessment (FSA) verification in Indonesia for more 
than 1,000 acres of cinnamon gardens. The restrictions 
in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic made the 
achievement all the more impressive, with significant 
effort required to ensure a qualified auditor could 
be trained locally, as travel restrictions prevented 
international travel for auditors. Since then, two more 
groups have been verified, bringing the total verified 
area to nearly 3,000 acres.As a global leader in flavor, we pride ourselves in our 
ability to bring authentic flavors to people all over the 
world. McCormick’s complex supply chain helps us 
meet consumer demand without compromising our 
environmental goals. We understand the growing desire 
of customers and consumers to not only understand 
where our products are sourced, but also to have 
visibility to how they impact our planet
