McCormick’s Global Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear the 
Company’s commitment to fair labor standards and helps ensure 
that the Company aligns itself with suppliers that share this 
commitment and expects the same of their own suppliers. In order 
to comply with the Grown for Good standard, suppliers are also 
required to sign a code of conduct with their supplying farmers. 
McCormick ensures that quality, safety and employment standards 
are maintained throughout the Company’s supply chain and the 
Company reviews its supplier base to determine if corrective actions 
are needed. Moreover, McCormick maintains an anonymous hotline 
staffed by an independent organization for employees to report 
actual or potential violations of McCormick’s policies and codes of 
conduct without fear of retaliation
