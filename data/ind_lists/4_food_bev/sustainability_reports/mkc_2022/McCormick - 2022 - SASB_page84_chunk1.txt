In addition to signing the Ascend Compact with 
more than 100 other companies to address racial 
bias, we have made recent charitable donations and 
have honored the commitments we have made in 
the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion space. McCormick 
donated an additional $500,000 to employee-
nominated organizations in the U.S. that combat social 
injustice or provide critical food, healthcare or other 
essential services to Black communities impacted by 
police brutality
