of our global workforce, in particular protecting our front-
line workers during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We have various initiatives to promote employee health 
and have set the goal of having 80% of employees 
participating in voluntary health and wellbeing programs. 
We are committed to protecting the health and safety of our 
employees by providing an environment free of risks and 
hazards and weâ€™re currently developing a new occupational 
health and safety program that will be fully standardized 
across the organization. We also aim to have 80% of our 
global employees participating in our main corporate 
giving initiative, the Power of Giving. Additionally, the 
core of our business is providing healthy and safe products 
to consumers worldwide. We remain steadfast in our pursuit 
of increased visibility into our products for customers, as 
evidenced by our goal to have 90% of sales from products 
that enable health, nutrition or natural consumer choices
