PLP REPORT
Although McCormick isnâ€™t a large user of water, we 
monitor water use in both our operations and supply 
chain. Our goal is to reduce water use in our facilities 
by 20% by 2025. Despite a 1% increase in water use 
in 2021 against our 2015 baseline, we have shown 
improvement. Additionally, we have identified several 
areas of focus to make progress toward our 2025 goal. 
We are also working to align our water baseline and 
target years to be consistent with our new 1 .50C GHG 
goals. Given our acquisition activity and the complexity 
of changeovers during operations, it will take focus and 
creativity to reach our goal. We will continue to devote 
resources to identify water savings and manage our 
water use efficiently to reduce our water within our 
facilities and reach our target
