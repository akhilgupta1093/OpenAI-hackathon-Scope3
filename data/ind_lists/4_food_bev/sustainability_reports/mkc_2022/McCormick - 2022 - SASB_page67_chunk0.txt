Protecting Sichuan Green Pepper
The distinct flavor of Sichuan Green Pepper has played 
an important role in Chinese cuisine for over 2,000 years. 
Unfortunately, the future of the Sichuan Green Pepper 
and its traditional farming processes have increasingly 
come under threat. Poor transportation connections with 
Sichuanâ€™s remote mountains have limited direct selling 
and worsened the impact of a long distribution chain 
through which the peppers are sold at low prices
