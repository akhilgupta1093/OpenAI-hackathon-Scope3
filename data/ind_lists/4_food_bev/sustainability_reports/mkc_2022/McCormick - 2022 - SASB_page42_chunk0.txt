OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORTSystem Overview
We are making strong progress in the development of our Occupational Health & Safety Management System 
and corresponding framework and standards. The systems and programs will be completed in the 2022 to 
2023 timeframe, with global implementation following shortly thereafter and all worksites will meet the 
expectations set within the system. Additionally , it will cover all McCormick employees and contractors that 
perform work at our sites. Highlights include:
â€¢  Identifying hazards, assessing risk work-related injuries and ill health, and investigating incidents. We 
are developing a robust hazards, risks, and incidents program leveraging the foundation of our McCormick 
Incident Rate (MIR) system, which is our global system used to measure all medical and lost time incidents, 
including those that require more than just first aid. Our processes allow any employee to privately raise 
risks and hazard identifications through formal communication channels
