CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO IMPROVEMENT (OUR GOALS)
2021
PLP REPORTPurpose-led Performance Goals
We’re excited to share the progress we’ve made toward our goals, which clearly demonstrates our continued focus on advancing sustainability. While we’re proud of our 
accomplishments, we recognize sustainability is a journey and there’s always work to be done. As such, we hold ourselves accountable to continuous improvement through a  
series of goals, organized by People, Communities and Planet pillars, to ensure an all-encompassing impact. 
We have a global database for all our PLP goals, which expands our ability to review project status by region, priority and start and end dates. The database also helps us create global 
and regional dashboard reports, which track project priorities, status, complexity and monthly progress, in addition to a Roadmap Report, which identifies annual targets toward our goals, 
tracks progress and risks, and is used by our PLP Governing Council in global decision-making. 
We have provided progress updates on all goals in the table that follows, but first wish to highlight several notable developments:
