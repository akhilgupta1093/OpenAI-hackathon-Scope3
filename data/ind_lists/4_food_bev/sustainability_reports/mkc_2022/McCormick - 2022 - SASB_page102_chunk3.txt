Our Environmental Management System (EMS) uses a global recognition 
scoring system to inform the controls and monitoring of our facilities. 
In 2021, our Clayton site achieved our highly protected environmental 
compliance management status. Our goal is to ensure that required 
management practices are fully implemented. Our focus on sophisticated 
effluent monitoring programs, new wastewater treatment systems and 
continued improvements to our EMS elements have contributed to the 
success of our environmental management.Commitment and Rigor
