OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORT
Wellness & BenefitsOur Global Wellbeing program for employees outlines 
McCormick’s commitment to having 80% of our 
global employees participating in wellness initiatives 
and programs by 2025. In 2020, we reinforced our 
commitment to employee wellness by building it into 
our organizational structure and hiring our first Global 
Wellbeing Lead, a new position charged with providing 
additional resources and support around mental health. 
Since then, we’ve launched Nourish, McCormick’s first 
global wellbeing program. Nourish is meant to define 
and broaden the definition of wellbeing for our entire 
global workforce and prioritize programs that support 
personal wellbeing for our employees. Programs within 
Nourish include those aimed at improving physical 
health and fitness, supporting work-life balance and 
ensuring personal growth. As we continue focusing on 
building sustainable engagement and measuring our 
employees’ motivations and energies to deliver their 
best performances, our 2022 roadmap includes a plan to 
capture participation rates over time
