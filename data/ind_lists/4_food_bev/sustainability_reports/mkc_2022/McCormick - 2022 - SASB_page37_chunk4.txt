        It has been great to connect with so many global colleagues.  
It has been eye-opening for me to see that although we physically sit 
across the globe from one another , we share so many similarities, thoughts 
and experiences. It is great to be involved with so many like-minded 
women who are ambitious, driven and determined to succeed. If these 
are the future leaders of McCormick, our future looks bright!
