PLP REPORTOf note, McCormick’s Peterborough facility is set to 
become the Company’s first Net Zero Carbon Building. 
The 93,000 square meter (approximately 1 million 
square feet) facility adheres to the highest level of 
the UK Green Building Council’s (UKGBC) Net Zero 
Buildings Framework, delivering Net Zero Carbon in both 
construction and operations. We applied a “build less, 
build clever and build efficiently” methodology to reduce 
carbon emissions from construction by an estimated 
30%. Achieving Net Zero Carbon in construction and  
operations marks a major achievement for our Company. 
The landmark facility and design process represents 
a major advancement for sustainable construction 
and operations as well as the future of our business. 
Measures like on-site, low-carbon concrete mixing  
capabilities and reuse of excavated soil helped us 
reduce emissions and limit the environmental impact of 
construction. The remaining construction emissions were 
offset through our investment in wind power in Turkey. In addition to McCormick’s wind offsets, the Company has 
gone a step further by supporting long-term reforestation 
efforts through the Woodland Carbon Code (WCC) at The 
Lowther Whale initiative in the Lake District National Park
