We have revised our product transparency goal to better 
promote consumer health. Our newly stated goal is: 
90% of our sales are from products that enable health, 
nutrition or natural consumer choices. We will track and 
report a detailed breakdown by additives; fat, saturated fat, 
sodium and cholesterol; beneficial nutrients; relative claims; 
products containing GMOs; and those that are labeled as 
non-GMO
