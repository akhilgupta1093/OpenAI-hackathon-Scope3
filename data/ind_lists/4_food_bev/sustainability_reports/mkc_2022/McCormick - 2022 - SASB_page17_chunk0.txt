United Nations Sustainable  
Development Goal Alignment
No Poverty
In line with our Purpose-led Performance goals, we work in a variety of ways to improve 
the resilience and livelihoods of the farming communities that grow our key raw 
materials. This has included distributing personal protective equipment (PPE) during 
the COVID-19 pandemic and training farmers to improve agricultural practices in 
ways that will increase income. We also announced a partnership in August 2021 
with Citigroup, World Bank and IFC to provide suppliers with financial incentives 
linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability. 
The program has started with suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam and will soon be 
launched in other countries. McCormick has a long legacy of supporting communities 
where we live, work and operate and, through numerous initiatives, including charitable 
donations, weâ€™ve demonstrated our commitment to strengthening their wellbeing. Zero Hunger
As a global leader in flavor, we are uniquely positioned to aid in the effort to 
achieve zero hunger. Among our many commitments to farming communities, 
we are teaching farmers sustainable and effective growing techniques through 
our Grown for Good program, which supports farmer and community resilience. 
We aim to increase the resilience of 90% of smallholder farmers that grow 
our key iconic herbs and spices, as measured by increasing skills and capacity, 
income, access to financial services, education, nutrition and health. Additionally in 
2020, we donated more than $10 million across 22 countries to organizations 
addressing issues like healthcare access, racial injustice and food security, including 
more than $3 million to food banks, and in 2021, we donated over $8.2 million 
around the world
