To better equip the farmers with the ability to expand
their distribution networks, we plan to donate saplings 
and provide training on how to use e-commerce to 
increase direct sales. Additionally, the McCormick China 
team is developing new products leveraging Jin Yang 
Green Sichuan Pepper, promoting its story as it offers 
high-quality Sichuan Green Pepper products.
