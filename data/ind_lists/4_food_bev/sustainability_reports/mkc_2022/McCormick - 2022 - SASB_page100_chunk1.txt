McCormick’s waste management goal seeks to recycle 
and recover 80% of solid waste from our facilities by 
2025. We recognize that we haven’t made the progress 
expected and we are identifying additional opportunities 
to improve our waste recycling and management 
processes. We’re also strengthening our governance 
process to ensure we’re making the progress needed to 
reach our goal. To date, we’ve implemented programs 
to monitor our solid waste streams for all facilities in the 
Americas. Waste management draws on the logistical 
expertise of our staff to design site-specific plans to 
manage waste appropriately for individual geographies 
and municipal waste systems.In Thailand, McCormick has partnered with a waste 
supplier to transform unused pepper, flour and water 
into fertilizer for local farmers. The initiative diverts solid 
waste and provides organic fertilizer to support the 
livelihood and resilience of farmers. More information  
on McCormick’s efforts to support farmers is included in
