102-9 Supply ChainMcCormick ingredients are sourced from a variety of locations, including: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mexico, Turkey, United 
States, and Vietnam. The most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products, pepper, vanilla, garlic, capsicums (red peppers and 
paprika), onion, rice and wheat flour. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw 
materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced locally, either within the United States or from our international locations. Because the raw 
materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, 
market conditions, and other factors beyond our control
