All E-scores are on a scale between 0 and 10. A value below 5 identifies 
a significant risk, 5.1-7 .5 provides room for improvement and over 7 .5 
is considered resilient or empowered. Womenâ€™s empowerment is a 
complex challenge requiring sensitivity and a local understanding of 
cultural nuances. We work with our partners to address opportunities in 
a thoughtful and respectful manner, with the understanding that shifts 
in attitude can take years to achieve. However, by focusing on the areas where we can create the greatest impact, and through continuous review 
and adjustments to our programming, our vision is to create positive 
change for the women working across our agricultural supply chains
