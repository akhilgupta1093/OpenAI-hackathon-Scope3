Not only is greater transparency beneficial to our 
consumers, but we are eager to showcase the value of 
our products. As we gather increasing amounts of research 
about our products, much of our work centers around gaining 
a better understanding of our consumers, with the goal of 
providing them with more meaningful information about our 
products. We have found that claims that are linked  
to a consumer benefit, such as flavor, resonate with 
customers, as well as claims that are linked to an 
environmental impact, like water conservation and 
sustainability. We work to achieve organic accreditation 
where possible, as well as third-party verified sustainability 
certification.Transparency
We have revised our product transparency goal to better promote consumer 
health as demonstrated by our newly stated goal: 90% of our sales are from 
products that enable health, nutrition or natural consumer choices.ABOUT
