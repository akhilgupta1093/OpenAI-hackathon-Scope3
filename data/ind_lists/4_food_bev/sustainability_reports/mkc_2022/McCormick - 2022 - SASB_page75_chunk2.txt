We seek to empower women and minority groups 
in our supply chain and support a diverse network of 
suppliers. Our supplier diversity program helps ensure 
our ingredients are sourced from a mix of suppliers while providing opportunities and access to underrepresented 
groups. We have a formal program to grow our spend with 
diverse suppliers. In an effort to increase transparency 
with our stakeholders, we continue to evolve our program 
to better serve our supply chain needs and are committed 
to providing quarterly supplier diversity spend reports to 
customers looking to understand the impact of the goods 
provided to them
