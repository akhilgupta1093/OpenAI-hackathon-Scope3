Our nine Employee Ambassador Groups (EAGs) provide an 
opportunity for all employees at every level of the Company 
to join as members and/or actively participate in learning 
workshops and cultural activities in an open environment. 
These groups provide a supportive, collaborative space 
for employees to come together to promote inclusion, 
strengthen communities, learn new skills, advance in 
the workplace and network with colleagues across 
the Company. All EAGs have executive sponsors, which 
rotate on a regular basis, and operate as an extension of our 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion office
