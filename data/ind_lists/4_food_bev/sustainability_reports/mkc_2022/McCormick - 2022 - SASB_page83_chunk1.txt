As part of our global response to COVID-19, we 
committed $3 million to supporting food banks in 
the countries where we operate, as well as local 
restaurants and hospitality workers. We also called 
upon our communities and other organizations 
to join us in providing critical financial assistance. 
McCormick’s support for food banks continues 
following an initiative in 2019 which provided 1 .3 
million meals for our 130th anniversary milestone.In the U.S., we also teamed up with COREcares in 
partnership with OLD BAY and McCormick for Chefs 
businesses to establish the Maryland Restaurant 
Relief Fund, which provided grants to local restaurant 
operators, as well as the Hospitality Cares Pandemic 
Response Fund in partnership with its Zatarain’s 
and McCormick for Chefs brands to help support 
hospitality workers and restaurants in New Orleans
