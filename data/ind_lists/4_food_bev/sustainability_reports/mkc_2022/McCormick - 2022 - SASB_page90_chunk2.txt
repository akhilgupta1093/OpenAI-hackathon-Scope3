Erratic weather patterns, natural disasters and other 
shocks can and have impacted the origin countries of our 
raw agricultural materials. In 2021, bush fires in southern 
Turkey impacted bay leaf growing areas. Severe floods in India in 2018 increased the outbreak of disease in 
the materials sourced from those regions, including 
turmeric and red pepper, thus reducing the yield in 2019 
and impacting market price of commodities. To manage 
risk, McCormick implements dual or multi-origin sourcing 
of its agricultural raw materials where possible. For 
example, black pepper is sourced from Vietnam, Brazil, 
Indonesia, India, etc. to reduce the impact of a poor 
harvest in a particular region. In addition, our farm-level 
sustainability programs include training on climate-smart 
agriculture and resilience to shocks.Meeting our Sustainable Sourcing Goals
