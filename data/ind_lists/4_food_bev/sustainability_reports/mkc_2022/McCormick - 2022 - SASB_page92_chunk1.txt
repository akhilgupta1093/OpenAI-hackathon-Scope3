McCormick does not produce or use significant volumes 
of palm oil; however, due to our 2017 acquisition of 
the French’s® Food Company, we use palm oil in the 
production of specific French’s® products. Despite the 
relatively low volumes of palm oil we use, we identified 
it as a priority raw material due to its potential impact 
on deforestation. As part of our PLP program, a cross-
functional task force on palm oil sustainability carries 
out an annual palm oil supply chain assessment and 
reviews progress toward a 2025 commitment roadmap. 
The roadmap captures McCormick’s global uses of palm 
oil along with availability of sustainable palm oil to help 
prioritize its use.To mitigate the use of palm oil in our products, McCormick 
has joined the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 
(RSPO) program, an organization that implements global 
standards for sustainable palm oil. In 2020, we met our 
2025 goal to sustainability source 100% of the palm oil 
within our supply chain through the RSPO. Additionally, 
we’re working with other organizations, like the Consumer 
Goods Forum (CGF) to establish programs and processes 
to reduce risk surrounding palm oil and its sustainable 
production.Expanding the Scope of our Programs
Palm Oil
Our risk around deforestation related to soy is very low 
as a large majority of our soy is sourced in North America. 
Our Global Supplier Code of Conduct covers our first-tier 
suppliers and requires our suppliers to be responsible for any deforestation and environmental impacts as well 
as the impacts of their own suppliers. Our supplier code 
of conduct allows us to audit our suppliers and inspect 
records related to their own upstream suppliers.Soy
