OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORT
McCormick is committed to creating and fostering inclusive workplaces and cultures in its operations around the 
world. In 2020, McCormick formed a committee of executive leaders who would help address and respond to 
social issues as they arise in the news and in our neighborhoods. This Social Issues Committee has come together 
during times of tension and unease to reaffirm our commitments to our people. Several pieces of work were moved 
forward and addressed, from signing an agreement to stand with the Asian and Black communities against hate to 
supporting Marriage Equality, among other causes
