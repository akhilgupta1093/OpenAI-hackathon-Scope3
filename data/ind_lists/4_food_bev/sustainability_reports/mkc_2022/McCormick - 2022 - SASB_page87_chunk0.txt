Sustainable Supply Chain
Our responsibility as a leader in the global food 
industry is to ensure our investments have tangible 
benefits, especially for farmers and customers, which 
we see most clearly in our own supply chain. We work 
to eliminate intermediaries so we can establish direct 
relationships with our suppliers and farmers. We also 
work with farmers and suppliers to implement risk 
oversight initiatives and promote our commitment to 
sustainable sourcing.McCormickâ€™s steadfast commitment to creating a 
sustainable supply chain for all of our stakeholders 
across people, communities and planet is secured by 
the principles outlined in our Sustainable Agriculture 
Policy, which ensures the agricultural raw materials 
in our products are produced responsibly through 
enhancing the environmental and social sustainability 
of our agricultural supply chain partners and local 
impacted communities.ABOUT
