Sourcing Excellence
Expertise in Supplier Quality Management is 
foundational to our ingredients and packaging sourcing 
activity. Our risk assessment processes enable us 
to understand the challenges that might be faced in 
assuring the integrity of all materials procured for use  in McCormick products. To pre-empt risk and implement 
effective control strategies, we pursue strategic 
alliances with key suppliers, enabling us to source 
ingredients free from contaminants and mitigating risk 
of food fraud. Through stringent supplier expectations 
including compliance to third party certification schemes, 
targeted auditing activities and high frequency testing 
through sophisticated analytical techniques, we 
guarantee the integrity of the materials that go into 
McCormick products. We leverage strong capabilities 
related to food science to test products for quality 
and safety regularly. We conduct extensive ingredient 
and product analyses to assure they meet our 
exacting quality standards. In addition, we use steam 
pasteurization processes at our strategic suppliers and 
within our own manufacturing plants to ensure the 
safety of our herbs and spices.1 QUALITY, SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE BY DESIGN
