PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
Providing Water Access to Red Pepper  
Communities with A VT McCormick
In 2019, we reported on our project to provide 
reverse osmosis clean drinking water facilities to four 
communities growing red pepper in India. Since then, we 
have expanded this program to nine villages, benefiting 
an estimated 30,000 household members. In addition, 
we have supported a pilot watershed project in Tamil Nadu aimed at increasing the water table to recharge 
water sources and mitigate the impact of water scarcity. 
The project was completed by World Vision India in 2020 
and facilitated an increase in the acreage under crop 
cultivation, including crop diversification
