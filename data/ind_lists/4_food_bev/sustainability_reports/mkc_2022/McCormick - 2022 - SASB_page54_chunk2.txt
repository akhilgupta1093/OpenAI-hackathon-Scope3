McCormick has continued to partner with the National 
Association of Manufacturing (NAM) on the STEP Ahead Initiative 
to recognize and highlight and develop women. The Company 
has also been working with Women in Manufacturing to 
deliver access to workshops and programs specifically for early 
career and middle management women. Additionally, we have 
established new external partnerships with organizations like the 
Womenâ€™s Food Forum and LEAD UK to increase the development 
of senior level women and increase hiring of top females.McCormick has also made several commitments to help attract, 
retain and develop ethnically diverse talent by establishing 
external diversity partnerships with groups like Ascend, which 
focuses on Asian Business Professionals, The Association 
of Latino Professionals for All, the National Organization on 
Disabilities, and the National Association of Black MBAs. These 
partnerships provide an opportunity to develop existing talent 
while also building relationships with future talent. Additionally, 
we have built external partnerships with historically Black colleges 
and universities that specialize in the Food Science space or that 
have engineering and technology programs that connect to our 
internship talent needs
