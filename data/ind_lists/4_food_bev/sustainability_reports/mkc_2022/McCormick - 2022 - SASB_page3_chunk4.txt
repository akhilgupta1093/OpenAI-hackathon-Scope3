At McCormick, Purpose-led Performance is more than just about meeting sustainability goals–it’s 
how we operate our business. It’s a journey that continuously evolves as our business and the 
world changes. With each Purpose-led Performance Report, we see that our investments are 
having real, tangible benefits and we’re excited to transparently share our progress and success 
as we move forward. We remain committed to doing what’s right for people, communities where 
we live, work and source and the planet we all share. 
Thank you for being a part of our journey
