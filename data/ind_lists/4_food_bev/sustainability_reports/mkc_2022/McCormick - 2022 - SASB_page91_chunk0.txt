PLP REPORT
For the last 25 years, we have partnered with our joint 
venture company, AVT McCormick, on the backwards 
integration of our red pepper supply chain. With the 
announcement of our sustainable sourcing goal in 2017 , 
we began the process of expanding training to third-party 
verified sustainability standards, and this year, achieved our 
2025 volume target, four years ahead of schedule. In addition 
to this outstanding milestone, the team has also completed 
the following:
•  During the 2020-21 season, A VT McCormick assisted 
farmers in implementing drip and mulch irrigation 
systems across 2,753 acres of Indian red pepper fields, 
which ultimately saved approximately 9,200 million 
liters of water•  A VT McCormick is the only spice company in India 
that has used the Biodiversity Monitoring Tool (BDMT), 
which was co-developed by GIZ, Union for Ethical 
BioTrade (UEBT) and Global Nature Fund (GNF) for 
monitoring biodiversity . The BDMT helps the team set 
seasonal targets on key biodiversity aspects and assess 
annual improvements in biodiversity management
•  In 2022, A VT McCormick will transition all red pepper 
supplied to McCormick to the Grown for Good standard
•  A VT McCormick has won a National A ward for 
Sustainable Agriculture based on the programs we run
