Following its effort to support Black communities 
worldwide, McCormick supported causes working to 
address anti-Asian hate crimes as Asian-Americans 
faced increased violence against their communities. 
McCormickâ€™s Asian Diversity Group (ADG) created 
and shared an Asian-owned Restaurant Guide to 
help support businesses. The ADG also continues to 
share anti-hate community resources, which provide 
information on bystander intervention, how to report 
a hate incident and understanding the right to be fairly 
treated in public
