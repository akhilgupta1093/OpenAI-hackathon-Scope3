In addition to our new goal, our Technically Advantaged 
Supply Chain (“TASC”) is working to deliver consumer and 
customer preference by applying science to the supply 
chain. In 2020, we launched TASC 3.0, which leverages 
state-of-the-art science, technology, digitalization and a 
culture of innovation to create competitive advantage and 
value across the supply chain
