OUR GLOBAL PURPOSE-LED PERFORMANCE APPROACH
2021
PLP REPORT
McCormick’s commitments to people and communities 
naturally and necessarily extend to the planet we all share, 
starting in our supply chain, continuing throughout our 
operations, and going beyond our organization through 
initiatives like supporting a circular plastics economy. We 
now source 100% of our branded red pepper sustainably 
and are steadily progressing toward sustainably 
sourcing our five iconic branded herbs and spices by 
2025. We created Grown for Good, a first-of-its-kind, 
third-party-verified sustainability standard for herb and 
spice suppliers. Grown for Good promotes community 
resilience, social and ethical practices for workers in our 
suppliers’ factories, farmer resilience, biodiversity and 
regenerative farming practices. And most notably, we 
have committed to leveraging the Science Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) to achieve 1 .50C by 2030 and Net Zero by 
2050. Core to this effort are ambitious Scope 3 emissions 
reductions we’re pursuing in partnership with suppliers 
and industry peers through our Supplier Leadership on 
Climate Transition (S-LoCT) program.We also continue to significantly invest in energy-efficient 
facilities and renewable energy, and have completed
construction on McCormick’s new manufacturing site 
in Peterborough, UK, which is on track to become the 
Company’s first Net Zero Carbon building. Additionally, 
Project Skipjack and Big Star Solar, for example, are 
providing renewable electricity to power 100% of our 
North American facilities in Maryland, New Jersey  
and Texas. 
As clearly described in our Environmental Policy, we 
are committed to the continuous improvement of our 
environmental performance in our day-to-day business 
activity and to meet or exceed the requirements of all 
applicable environmental laws and regulations.Planet
