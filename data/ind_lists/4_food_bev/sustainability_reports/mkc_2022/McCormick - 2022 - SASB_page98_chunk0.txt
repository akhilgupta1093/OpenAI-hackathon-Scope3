PLP REPORT
With the help of Guidehouse, we provide our suppliers 
access to financial support and monthly training 
to understand how to establish Scope 1, 2, and 3 
footprints, how to set science-based targets, and 
how to abate emissions throughout their operations. 
McCormick has engaged more than 90 of our suppliers 
through this program, including suppliers who form 
a significant portion of our Scope 3 greenhouse gas 
footprint. In April 2021, together with our partners, we 
launched the inaugural training season of S-LoCT and 25 of our suppliers participated in the 6-month training. The 
program was so successful that in October 2021, five 
additional food industry and packaging companies joined 
S-LoCT as brand sponsors and more than 180 supplier 
companies enrolled in the program, including more than 
40 McCormick suppliers. In 2022 more training tracks 
are being added and the brand sponsors continue to 
grow. S-LoCT will offer two 6-month trainings each year.Supplier Leadership on Climate
Transition (S-LoCT)As part of McCormickâ€™s sustainable vanilla sourcing 
program, McCormick has partnered with USAID 
Biodiversity and Sustainable Landscape Conservation and 
Communities Projects in two regions of Madagascar to 
encourage biodiversity, improve farmer livelihoods and 
prevent deforestation. By supporting responsible vanilla 
production that is free from deforestation, improving 
farmer livelihoods and curbing other deforestation drivers in these communities, McCormick aims to slow the 
clearing of forests, which sequester carbon from the 
atmosphere, an important resource that regulates our 
climate and provides essential environmental benefits. 
These projects currently support over 3,000 vanilla 
farmers in Madagascar.Supporting Biodiversity and Forest
