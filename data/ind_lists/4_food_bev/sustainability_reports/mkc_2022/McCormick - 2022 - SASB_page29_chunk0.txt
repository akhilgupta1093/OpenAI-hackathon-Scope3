PLP REPORT
We utilize an automated third-party risk-based management program, called RiskRate, 
which drives strong efficiency and efficacy when mitigating the risk of transactions with 
third parties through identifying red-flags and other risk factors. When applicable, we 
may drive forward further risk-based assessments as deemed appropriate. RiskRate 
and our broad third-party risk management efforts ensure we are evaluating the extent 
to which our partners act ethically, conduct business in compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations and embrace our Company’s values. RiskRate is a cross-functional effort, 
including support from our Legal, Internal Audit and Ethics and Compliance departments.Third-Party Monitoring 
& Risk Management
McCormick believes it’s important to educate policymakers and participate in public 
dialogue around issues to which we can positively contribute, but is careful to maintain 
our independence, as evidenced in our policies. We do not contribute to political action 
committees (PACs), political campaign committees, whether candidate-controlled or 
independent, or ballot initiatives. Employees at all levels must comply with applicable laws 
and internal policies.Political Activity PolicyABOUT
