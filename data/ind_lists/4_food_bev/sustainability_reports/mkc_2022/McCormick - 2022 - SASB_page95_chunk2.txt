With the submission of our 1.5°C target, we will 
join the UN Science Based Targets initiative’s 
Business Ambition for 1.5°C, a global coalition of 
companies across sectors and geographies that 
have acknowledged the critical importance of 
limiting the impacts of climate change.We plan to submit our new goals for approval through 
the Science Based Targets initiative. The new reduction 
goal will use our 2020 emissions as a baseline year and 
from there, we are targeting a reduction of 42% in our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions along with a 42% reduction in 
our Scope 3 emissions by 2030. Increases in the amount 
of renewable electricity sourced for our operations will 
be central in meeting our goal. We have developed 
and supported large-scale renewable energy projects 
in regions where we operate, and we will pursue 
increased reliance on renewable energy. In tandem, we 
will continue to address energy use through efficiency, 
continual improvement and innovations in processing 
and distribution.Our Scope 3 emissions reduction efforts will rely 
heavily on our Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition 
(S-LoCT) program, which engages our suppliers to 
reduce emissions and set science-based targets. 
We actively partner with our suppliers to improve our 
environmental performance, and continued participation 
within our supply chain will be critical to support our 
suppliers and achieve our Scope 3 target
