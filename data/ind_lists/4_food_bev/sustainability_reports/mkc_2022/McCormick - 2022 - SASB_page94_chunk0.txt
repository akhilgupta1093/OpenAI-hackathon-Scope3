PLP REPORT
In honor of the 2021 World Environment Day theme, 
“Ecosystem Restoration, “ employees globally were 
invited to help combat deforestation and sponsor a 
tree in Madagascar, where 80% of the world’s supply 
of vanilla is produced. Deforestation has impacted over 
94% of Madagascar forest lands, which provide critical 
shade cover for growing vanilla. To help, McCormick employees opted in to have the 
Company plant one tree per employee, a total of 13,000 
trees around the Marojejy National Park to increase 
impact and support the livelihoods of farmers and 
communities in Madagascar. In collaboration with
USAID and other suppliers, McCormick has supported 
the planting of 200,000 trees in this region to date.Restoring Ecosystems
