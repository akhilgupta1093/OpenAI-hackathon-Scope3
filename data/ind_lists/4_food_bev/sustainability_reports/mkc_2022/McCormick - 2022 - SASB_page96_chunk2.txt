In addition to purchasing renewable energy, McCormick
has directly supported the development of several climate-
friendly renewable energy and building projects. In addition 
to the construction of McCormick’s flagship Net Zero Carbon 
Building in Peterborough, UK, McCormick has helped to 
develop renewable energy resources to support our facilities globally. In El Salvador, we’ve installed a rooftop solar project, 
which will enable us to power our manufacturing facility with 
approximately 10% renewable electricity. Also, the Skipjack 
Solar Center, an off-site solar array, is providing renewable 
electricity to McCormick facilities in Maryland and New Jersey, 
including four manufacturing plants, two distribution centers 
and our corporate headquarters. Additionally, planning and 
studies are underway for an additional 1 .8 million square foot 
on-site distributed solar project for our Northeast Distribution 
Center in Maryland, along with an agreement to purchase 
energy from the 200MW Big Star Solar project currently under 
development to power our operations in Texas. 
A new facility built with purpose in mind in Melbourne, Australia, 
designed for sustainability, will serve as a warehouse and 
headquarters. The facility was designed and built to a 5-Star 
Green Star Rating under the Green Star sustainability rating 
system developed by the Green Building Council of Australia 
(GBCA) and will feature a technical innovation center along with 
a 600kW rooftop solar system and electric car charging stations
