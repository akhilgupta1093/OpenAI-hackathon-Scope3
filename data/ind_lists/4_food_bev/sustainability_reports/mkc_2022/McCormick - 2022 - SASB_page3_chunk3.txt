McCormick understands the importance of limiting climate change and doing what’s right for 
the planet. We are dramatically increasing the use of renewable energy sources to power our 
operations and have made large investments in sustainable manufacturing facilities. Since our last 
report, we’ve updated our science-based targets to align to 1 .50C by 2030 and to achieve Net Zero 
by 2050. As a result, we’ve adjusted our goals to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions by 42% by 2030
