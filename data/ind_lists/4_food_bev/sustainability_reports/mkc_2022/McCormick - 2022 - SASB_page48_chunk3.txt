Our EAGs, which include the Asian Diversity Group (ADG), 
African American Ambassador Group, US Veterans, 
Y oung Professionals, Sabor Latino, SAGE (Seasoned 
Ambassador Group of Experience), WIN (Women’s 
International Network) and PRISM, a group for LGBTQ+ 
employees or allies, are an integral part of our culture. SAGE, 
which focuses on older employees, was instrumental in 
the discussions around COVID and helped the organization 
understand needs for employees who are also caregivers.The U.S. Veterans’ Employee Ambassador Group 
has been critical in helping McCormick build an external 
presence as a military-friendly employer at a national level in 
the U.S. This group has worked very closely with the Talent 
Acquisition team to help attract veterans to the Company. 
The group annually has played a role in awarding scholarship 
dollars to students at the various military academies. They 
have been critical in educating and raising awareness about 
career opportunities as well as onboarding new hires who 
are military veterans
