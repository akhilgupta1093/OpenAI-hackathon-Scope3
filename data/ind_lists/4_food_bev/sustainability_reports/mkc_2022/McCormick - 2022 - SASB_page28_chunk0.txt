ETHICS & COMPLIANCE
2021
PLP REPORTMcCormick provides internal and external mechanisms
for seeking advice about ethical and lawful behavior;
organizational integrity; and reporting concerns about
unethical or unlawful behavior as described in its 
Business Ethics Policy. Specifically, any employee with 
reason to believe in good faith that an actual or potential 
ethics or compliance violation has occurred can report it to one of several qualified parties, including his or her 
supervisor, an HR representative, our General Counsel, 
the Ethics and Compliance team, or the Chair of the Audit 
Committee, without fear of retaliation. Reports can also 
be made through our confidential hotline that is staffed 
by an independent organization.Reporting Framework
