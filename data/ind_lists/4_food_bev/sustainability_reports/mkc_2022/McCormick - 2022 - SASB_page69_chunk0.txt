Navigating a Global Pandemic 
with CARE in India
Building community resiliency includes reducing the impact of 
shocks caused by human or natural disasters. With the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick worked with CARE Impact 
Partners, CARE India and the AVT McCormick team to limit the 
impact on red pepper communities. AVT McCormick is a 50:50 
joint venture between A.V. Thomas & Company and McCormick. 
The AVT McCormick team has been working with red pepper 
farmers and villagers in India for nearly 25 years. Connections to the community allowed McCormick to act quickly as concerns 
around COVID-19 grew. The objectives were to build community-
wide awareness on proper health and hygiene practices, which 
support long-term behavior change, and distribute PPE supplies to 
households to kick-start household use and encourage local market 
responses. Interventions also included wall murals, street plays and 
information checklists with all PPE kits
