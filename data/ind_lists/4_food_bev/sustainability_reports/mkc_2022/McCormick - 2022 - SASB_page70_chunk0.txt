PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
Supporting Vanilla Suppliers Through  
the Pandemic
McCormickâ€™s partnership with the Sustainable Vanilla 
Initiative (SVI) has advanced the interests of vanilla 
farmers in Madagascar critical to biodiversity. In 2020, in 
Madagascar, as vanilla growers made plans to aggregate 
and sell their beans through local markets across the 
country, the historically busy markets raised concerns 
due to the growing effects of COVID-19 in the country. 
Lockdowns prevented travel by road and air, adding logistical 
complications to the growing public health concerns. 
McCormick worked closely with the Sustainable Vanilla 
Initiative, along with the Madagascar Vanilla Exporters Group 
(GEVM), GIZ and the SAVABE Project, to form a strategy to 
put protective measures into place so the markets could 
continue to function. Through a quick response, McCormick, SVI and its partners 
took action to ensure large buyers could continue to 
connect with the many vanilla farmers across Madagascar. 
McCormick, along with the coalition of organizations, 
supplied face masks, hand-washing stations and public 
service posters to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
Through the collective effort and fundraising of McCormick, 
along with local and international groups, obstacles were 
addressed in a short time period to protect the health and 
livelihoods of farmers and local communities
