Similarly, our U.S. Ignite Program, also in partnership with Korn Ferry for ethnically diverse talent, 
cultivates talent through a competitive nomination process that helps identify and partner participants 
with managers in an intense three-day curriculum designed to help manage headwinds in careers. As 
with Global Womenâ€™s Ignite, U.S. Ignite was reformatted during the pandemic, to an eight-month, eight-
session virtual experience. Participants have praised the opportunity to connect with colleagues and gain 
the tools to think through their career progression
