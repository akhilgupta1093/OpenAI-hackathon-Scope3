The program, previously conducted over two, three-day, in-person sessions, was converted to an all-
virtual, nine-session experience. Members of the 22-woman cohort responded positively to the reimagined

over nine months instead of a tightly scheduled week allowed participants to spend more time preparing 
for the sessions and building relationships with one another outside the program
