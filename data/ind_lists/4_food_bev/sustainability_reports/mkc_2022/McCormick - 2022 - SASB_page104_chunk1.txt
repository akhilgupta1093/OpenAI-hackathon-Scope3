We completed an audit of our existing portfolio to 
determine problematic plastics and ultimately eliminated 
95% of BPA (Bisphenol A) from all of our packaging 
in order to achieve 100% circular plastics packaging 
(reused, recycled or repurposed). We also identified 
problematic multilayer plastics (13%), those typically used 
to make sachets, as the main barrier. Our intention is to 
replace this with a mono-polymer or fiber-based film that 
is recyclable by 2025. We will also remove the 3% multi-
component rigid packaging, which will then make all of 
our plastic packaging recyclable.Since then, we’ve introduced upwards of 146 initiatives 
across all geographies to help us meet our sustainable 
packaging goals. We’ve also replicated successful 
initiatives across our global regions. Not only will these 
initiatives propel us towards achieving our goals, but new 
product innovation also strengthens our relevance with 
consumers and differentiates our brand
