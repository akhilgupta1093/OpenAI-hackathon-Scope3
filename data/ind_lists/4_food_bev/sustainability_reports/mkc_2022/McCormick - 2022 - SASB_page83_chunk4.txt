In response to concern for people and wildlife 
being affected by the Australian bushfires in early 
2020, McCormick supported regional disaster relief. 
McCormick Foods Australia coordinated a stock donation to the Australian Foodbank to distribute food 
and supplies to stricken areas. Meanwhile, McCormick 
contributed to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Australia 
to help care for animals and restore their habitat and 
donated to the Australian Red Cross to support recovery 
programs for emergency assistance in the region. 
Finally, McCormick again matched employee donations 
to the Australian Red Cross and WFF dollar-for-dollar
