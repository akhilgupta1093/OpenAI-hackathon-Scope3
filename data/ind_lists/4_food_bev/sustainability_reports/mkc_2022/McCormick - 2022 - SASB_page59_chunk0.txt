PLP REPORT
McCormick found a logical partner in Nathan Lyons late last year when his TikTok videos began to go viral. Lyons, a 
father of six living in Western Sydney, posts on his social media pages recipes that use affordable pantry ingredients 
like tinned meat, Devon sausage and Keen’s curry. The recipes pay homage to his upbringing and to Koori culture. His 
recipes originally started as a way for Lyons to show his kids more about his Wiradjuri experience, having descended 
from the indigenous peoples and original inhabitants of the New South Wales region in Australia.Kooking with a Koori
Lyons demonstrates that cooking can be easy and affordable to encourage more people to get into the kitchen 
and cook healthy meals for their families. Lyons’ videos showcase ideas from after-school snacks and budget 
dinners to fun and more complicated dinner ideas. Lyons’ Kooking with a Koori page now features more 
than 100 recipes, and he released a cookbook in July. McCormick is proud to support Lyons’ excitement for 
traditional foods and flavors that honor cultural and family traditions
