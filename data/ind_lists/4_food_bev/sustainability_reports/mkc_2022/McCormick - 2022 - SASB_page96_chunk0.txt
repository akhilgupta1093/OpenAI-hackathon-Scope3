PLP REPORTRenewable energy has allowed us to make significant 
improvement in our Scope 2 emissions. Our strategy to 
manage Scope 1 emissions is similar to our strategy for 
managing consumption of purchased electricity. We audit our 
facilities for energy efficiency opportunities to reduce both 
on-site fuel consumption and purchased electricity and capture 
opportunities in our capital plan, staying up to date on best 
practices and the latest technology. Scope 1 emissions are 
about 30% of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We have 
introduced efficiencies along with creative measures to reduce 
Scope 1 emissions. At our Dallas plant, we capture waste heat 
from air compressors to heat water used in changeovers to 
reduce our reliance on the plantâ€™s natural gas-burning heating 
system.  
Our U.S. Spice Mill is in the process of upgrading to a more 
efficient boiler that will also use less natural gas to produce 
the same amount of steam for its steam system. We continue 
to investigate projects to reduce Scope 1 emissions with 
additional projects planned for 2022
