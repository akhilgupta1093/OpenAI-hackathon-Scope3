on these health benefits to consumers, health professionals and other stakeholders. Led by nutrition scientists, the 
Institute’s work is guided by a Scientific Advisory Council consisting of internationally renowned scientists and health 
professionals from leading research institutions.McCormick is committed to producing and distributing high-quality, nutritious products for use by our consumers
