PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
McCormick is deeply engaged with the farming 
communities where our ingredients are grown. These 
strong ties allow us to improve the reliability and 
environmental impact of our business while supporting 
farming communities and their livelihoods. Our efforts are 
tailored to the communities where our main ingredients 
are sourced, allowing us to be active partners in the  
value chain.Our goal is to increase the resilience of 90% of 
smallholder farmers that grow our key iconic herbs and 
spices, as measured by increasing skills and capacity, 
income, access to financial services, education and 
nutrition and health. Currently, weâ€™re working with 
nearly 23,000 farmers to improve livelihoods, with a 
goal of increasing resilience for 35,000 farmers by 2025. 
Our impact is also far greater as we consider how our 
programming has positively affected sourcing community 
members, rather than just farmers.Farmer Communities and Livelihoods
