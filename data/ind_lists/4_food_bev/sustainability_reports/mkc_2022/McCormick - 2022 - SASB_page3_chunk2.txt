Improving the livelihoods of the farmers who grow our iconic ingredients remains a top priority  
for McCormick. To date, we’ve been able to increase the resilience of over 22,800 smallholder
farmers, putting us over the halfway point to our 2025 goal of positively impacting the lives
of 35,000 farmers. We also have a steadfast focus on support for women farmers. McCormick,  
in partnership with CARE International, has launched the McCormick Women’s Empowerment
Framework, designed to assess the level of women’s empowerment in key sourcing communities
and address opportunities to reduce inequality. To ensure the sustainable sourcing of our
herbs and spices, we’ve advanced McCormick’s Grown for Good framework to include our third-
party verified sustainability standard for suppliers in the herbs and spices industry. The Grown for Good framework–the first-of-its-kind in the herb and spice industry–promotes community 
resilience, economic stability for farmers, gender equality, women’s empowerment, biodiversity, 
conservation and regenerative farming practices. To date, we’ve also achieved 100% sustainably 
sourced branded red pepper and have made significant progress toward sustainably sourcing our 
other branded iconic ingredients (Cinnamon, Oregano, Black Pepper and Vanilla)
