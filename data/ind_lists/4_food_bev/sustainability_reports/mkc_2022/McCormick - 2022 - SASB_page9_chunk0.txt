OUR GLOBAL PURPOSE-LED PERFORMANCE APPROACH
2021
PLP REPORT
McCormick’s commitment to doing what’s right extends 
from individuals to entire communities, including those we 
serve and, just as importantly, those from which we source. 
McCormick has long worked to steadily build resilience and 
improve livelihoods in the farming communities where our 
ingredients are grown, as evidenced by continued progress 
on our smallholder farmer resilience goal and a wide range 
of globe-spanning initiatives. Tailored to each specific 
community where enacted, we’ve invested in community 
resilience in Vietnam, Indonesia, Turkey, Madagascar and 
India, by partnering with non-governmental organizations 
on training and infrastructure, improving access to financing 
and income diversification for vanilla farmers in Madagascar
