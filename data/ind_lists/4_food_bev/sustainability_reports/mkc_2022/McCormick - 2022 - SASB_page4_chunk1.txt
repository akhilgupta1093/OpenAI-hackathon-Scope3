Our approach to sustainability and PLP is rooted in our long 
history of delivering industry-leading financial performance 
while doing what’s right for people, the communities 
where we live, work, and source and the planet we all 
share. The approach outlined in this report was developed 
based on our longstanding commitment to sustainability, 
engagement with our stakeholders, ongoing relationships 
with customers and suppliers and industry best practices. 
Our stakeholder engagement efforts encompass feedback 
from key groups including our global leadership team, 
shareholders, employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, 
intergovernmental organizations (“IGOs”), non-governmental 
organizations (“NGOs”) and trade bodies
