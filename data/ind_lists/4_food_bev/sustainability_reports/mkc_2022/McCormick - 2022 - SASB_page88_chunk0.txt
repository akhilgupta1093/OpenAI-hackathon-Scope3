PLP REPORT
In February 2021, black pepper grown across 100 
hectares of farmland in Brazil became the first raw 
material to be certified under the Grown for Good 
standard. Later in the year, vanilla from Indonesia was 
certified, demonstrating the flexibility of the standard 
across regions and raw materials. With an increasing 
number of suppliers discovering the benefits of the 
Grown for Good standard, programs are being rolled out 
for red pepper in India, vanilla in Madagascar and black 
pepper in Vietnam in 2022, with the expectation that 
other supply chains will follow
