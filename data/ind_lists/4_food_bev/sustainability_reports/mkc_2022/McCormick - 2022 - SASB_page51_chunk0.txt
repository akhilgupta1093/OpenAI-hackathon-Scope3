OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORTIn the last few years, we’ve seen how these EAGs have 
become an important, safe space for employees within 
our walls. In response to Asian hate crimes and violence 
across the country, members of ADG not only created a 
safe space internally for managers and employees to talk 
about what was happening externally, they also partnered 
with Ascend, a national professional association, to 
bring together more than 20 other major companies in 
the Maryland area to engage in learning about the Asian 
community. 
In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbury, the AAAN hosted a series of 
coffee chats with McCormick employees and leaders to 
share their perspectives and engage in open discussions 
with Black employees to determine how colleagues 
and leaders could help support them during a difficult time. The conversations from AAAN ultimately led to the 
creation of a Black Employee Advisory Group (BEAG), a 
group of McCormick’s senior leaders tasked with finding 
ways for the Company to support Black employees 
through the commitments we made to support Black 
lives. This group organized ongoing discussions to 
share in our commitment to racial equity and made 
recommendations for modifications to the internal job 
application process to promote equity. This group was also 
influential in the development of a Sponsorship Program 
for ethnically diverse talent and in championing for an 
organizational dashboard on diversity metrics. These 
conversations also led to focus group discussions with 
employees, which have been supported by the CEO and 
Executive Leadership Team. Overall, these groups have 
proven to be a lifeline for our employees during times 
when they needed the support the most
