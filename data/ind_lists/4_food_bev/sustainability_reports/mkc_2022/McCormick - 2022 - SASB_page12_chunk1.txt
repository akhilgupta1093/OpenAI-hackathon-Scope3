•  While our Board provides general oversight of environmental, social 
and governance (“ESG”) matters, the charter of the Nominating and 
Corporate Governance Committee requires the committee to directly 
oversee our corporate responsibility programs relating to ESG matters, 
except to the extent reserved for the full Board or another committee 
of the Board. As part of this oversight, our Board and its committees 
regularly review our material initiatives and policies related to ESG 
matters and progress with respect to our ESG commitments as it 
relates to their particular oversight duties.•  As part of the Company’s commitment to ensure diversity at all levels, 
approximately 36% of the Board are women and 27% is made up of 
ethnically diverse members
