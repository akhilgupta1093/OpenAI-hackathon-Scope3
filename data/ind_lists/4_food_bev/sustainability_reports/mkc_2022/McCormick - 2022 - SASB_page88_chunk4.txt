One key step toward compliance to the standard is 
the risk assessment, identifying gaps and mandatory 
improvements. We commissioned the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Verisk Maplecroft to conduct specific 
country and commodity supply risk analysis and 
mapping across multiple herb and spice supply chains. 
We review the analysis with in-country suppliers, 
working with them to proactively evaluate the risks and 
opportunities in their specific supply chains, and request 
that they provide evidence of how the risk is mitigated 
or plans for future-state mitigation strategies
