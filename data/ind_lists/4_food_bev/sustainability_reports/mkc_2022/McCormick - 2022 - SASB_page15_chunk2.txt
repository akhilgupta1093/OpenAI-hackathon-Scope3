The materiality assessment sourced topics and their relevancy from stakeholder engagement including 
surveys and interviews, and leading third-party ESG frameworks, standard-setters, rating agencies and 
providers. Specifically, as noted in our GRI index, we have aligned our materiality assessment with 
the Global Reporting Initiative. 
As demonstrated in our materiality assessment matrix and corresponding definitions chart at right, we 
have identified 24 material topics, which are stratified across three tiers of materiality. While we have 
tiered material topics, we recognize all areas are material and drive forward our success and strategy. 
However, the Strategic tier reflects topics where we can show leadership and differentiate ourselves, 
the Priority tier reflects priority material topics and the Material tier reflects generally material topics. 
Additionally, we have aligned our materiality matrix with our PLP reporting structure and 
designated topic categorization under People, Communities, Planet and Governance. Materiality Assessment
