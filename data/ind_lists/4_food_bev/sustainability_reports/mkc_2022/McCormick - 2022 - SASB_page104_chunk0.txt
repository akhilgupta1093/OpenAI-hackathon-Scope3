PLP REPORT
At McCormick, weâ€™ve introduced sustainable packaging 
to select product lines over time and have learned 
firsthand how sustainable packaging drives profitability. 
For example, our packaging commitments are partially 
underpinned by ongoing light-weighting efforts, which 
reduces both the packaging carbon footprint and direct 
costs to the business. Now, when a new product 
design is called for, our packaging team ensures that 
sustainability is embedded in the decision-making 
process
