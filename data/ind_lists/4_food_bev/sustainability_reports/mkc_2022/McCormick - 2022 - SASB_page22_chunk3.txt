We are also revising our product transparency goal to better align with sustainability standards. Our newly stated goal is: 90% of our sales are from products that enable health, nutrition or natural consumer 
choices. Our response will provide a detailed breakdown by additives, fat, saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterol, beneficial nutrients, relative claims, containing GMOs and containing non-GMO. Previously the goal 
had been 90% of products with improved transparency (non-GMO, BPA-free, Organic)
