PLP REPORT
Climate Action
A core piece of our sustainability work is addressing climate change with 
numerous initiatives underway across our organization and raising our ambition 
with 1.50C-aligned targets by 2030 and Net Zero by 2050 in support of 
the UN Global Compact Action Platform which supports the race to zero. 
These efforts include partnering with humanitarian aid organizations to 
build resilience in climate-change-vulnerable farming communities and 
collaborating with peers like Mars and PepsiCo and our suppliers to reduce 
Scope 3 emissions. We know our actions alone cannot prevent climate 
change, but we work across our value chain, with suppliers, policy makers 
and other stakeholders to find ways to collaboratively develop new climate 
change solutions. We also have various climate change goals in place to 
support the UN SDGs, including a 25% reduction in carbon footprint from 
packaging and 100% circular plastics packaging.Life on Land
Our Grown for Good sustainable sourcing standard embodies our commitment 
to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of land. This standard 
is the first of its kind in the herbs and spices industry and illustrates our 
dedication to advancing accountability and performance in the sustainability 
space. Under Grown for Good we also take measures to reduce water 
use, improve soil health, avoid habitat degradation, and optimize 
energy efficiency where possible. We committed to ensuring all palm oil 
used within our supply chain would be sustainability sourced through 
the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) by 2025 and, in 2020, we 
achieved that goal
