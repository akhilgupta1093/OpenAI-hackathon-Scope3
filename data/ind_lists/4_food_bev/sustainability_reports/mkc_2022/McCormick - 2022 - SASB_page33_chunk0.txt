GROWN FOR GOOD  FRAMEWORK: THE SUSTAINABLE TASTE OF Mc CORMICK
2021
PLP REPORT
One of the greatest challenges for customized certification programs is credibility and industry-
wide recognition. The cornerstone of the framework is the third-party verified standard and, 
with this in mind, we underwent the process of benchmarking the Grown for Good standard 
against other leading industry standards, achieving the equivalent of FSA Silver-level in 2021 . This 
benchmarking was completed independently by the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform and 
is therefore recognized across the food and beverage industry, allowing our customers to make 
verified sustainability claims on the certified raw materials we sell them. It is also the first private sustainability standard focused on herbs and spices to reach the FSA Silver equivalency level
