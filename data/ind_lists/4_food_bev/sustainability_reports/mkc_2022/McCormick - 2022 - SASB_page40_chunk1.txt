When it comes to recruitment, our DE&I Office has established key relationships with national 
professional associations including:
• Women in Manufacturing (“WiM”)
• Association of Latino Professionals for All (“ ALPFA ”)
• National Black MBA Association (“NBMBAA ”)
• The National Organization on Disability (“NOD”)
These groups provide opportunities for further leadership development for the members of our Employee 
Ambassador Groups (“EAGs”) while also providing opportunities for our Company to post jobs and recruit from the 
national networks
