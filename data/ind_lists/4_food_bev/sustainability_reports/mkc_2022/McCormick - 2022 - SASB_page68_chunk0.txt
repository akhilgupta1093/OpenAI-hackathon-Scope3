Farmer Engagement with GIZ in Madagascar
As part of our commitment to address social and economic issues in the vanilla 
supply chain, we have set a goal to work with 4,000 farmers in the Sava region 
of Madagascar. McCormick is partnering with the German Corporation for 
International Cooperation GmbH (GIZ) to engage farmer cooperatives in Sava 
and identify ways to improve the structure and governance of the supply chain 
to benefit the region. By assessing the communityâ€™s needs, GIZ and McCormick 
have identified challenges and have been able to launch interventions. Since then, the organizations have worked to increase access to basic services 
through a health insurance program, clean drinking water projects and interest-
free loans. Additionally, an initiative encompassing 2,500 farmers has increased 
access to extension services and provided training on the vanilla curing process 
and third-party verified sustainability certification to help farmers capture more 
added value while better managing waste and natural resources to preserve 
ecosystems
