in Provence and is located near our facilities in Avignon, France. Through 
our “Local Herbs” line for Ducros, L ’OFA tends beehives at a manufacturing 
cooperative in Provence to further their efforts to preserve healthy black bee 
populations in the region. Our French employees plant seed flowers and our 
sales team distributes L ’OFA honey to support our “plant flowers for bees” 
campaign.In Canada, McCormick’s Billy Bee Honey brand provides funding for the 
Honeybee Research Center at the University of Guelph. The research center 
supports funding and research related to the health of honeybee populations 
in Canada and worldwide. McCormick has also funded and participated in 
efforts to foster collaborative action within the Canadian honeybee industry 
through associations like the Canadian Honey Council.Protecting Bees Around the World
