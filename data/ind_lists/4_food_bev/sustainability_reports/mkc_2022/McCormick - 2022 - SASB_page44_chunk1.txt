Over the past two years, many of our employees 
experienced outside stressors caused by the pandemic 
and other events. To address these new challenges, 
we implemented our Caring Conversations initiative, which equips managers with tools and resources to 
connect with, better understand and support employees. 
Additionally, McCormick locations in Europe, the Middle 
East and Africa host Free Fruit Wednesdays to provide 
employees with healthy snack options and celebrate 
Mental Health Awareness Week each year
