In addition to an overall E-Score, the model provides a score for each KPI. 
These scores can vary significantly between communities and allow  
us to design community-level initiatives that address their specific needs. 
These may include income-diversification training, improving access  
to healthcare, and supporting access to resources through mechanisms 
such as Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). The framework  
also allows us to normalize E-Scores across our supply chains, which 
supports decision-making in allocating resources.Outcomes:
• Reliable access to financing, markets and systems
• Reliable inclusion in household and on-farm decisions
• Better nutrition and access to health
• Improved resilience and incomeIdentifying Opportunities
