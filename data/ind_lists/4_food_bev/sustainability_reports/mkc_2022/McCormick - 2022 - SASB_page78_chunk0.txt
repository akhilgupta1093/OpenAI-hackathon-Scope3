PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
The M-WEF baseline survey was piloted in late 2020 
with red pepper communities in India and cinnamon 
communities in Indonesia. This provided us with the 
opportunity to refine the model and identify a partner 
to digitize data-collection and analysis. It is now being rolled out across our key supply chains, starting with our 
other iconic raw materials. While deploying the M-WEF , 
we are engaging with our suppliers to run projects 
focused on improving women’s resiliency and that of 
their communities.Women’s Empowerment in Action
We have partnered on multiple social projects under 
our Grown for Good framework including:
•  Improving nursery and primary school facilities for 
over 3,000 children in Vietnam by installing water 
filtration systems
•  Financial management training reaching 
 approximately 400 female farmers in Vietnam •  Village Savings and Loans Associations have been set 
up in 11 villages in Madagascar with over 250 female

36 farms benefiting nearly 3,000 red pepper  
field workers
