PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
Driving Impact Across Multiple Supply Chains 
with USDA and NCBA CLUSA
This five-year project was initiated in 2019 in collaboration 
with the USDA Food for Progress Indonesia Spice 
T rade Alliance (ISTA), NGO partner NCBA CLUSA and 
cinnamon consultant PT Collins Higgins Consulting. 
The initiative aims to improve the quality of black pepper, 
cinnamon and vanilla in Indonesia and spans the regions of Jambi, N. Sumatra, Papua, Sulawesi, and Lampung. 
Productivity and efficiency will be increased through 
strengthening the capacities of farmers and cooperatives 
while building environmental resiliency and providing 
training in third-party verified sustainability standards
