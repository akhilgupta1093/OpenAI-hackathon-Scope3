By 2025, we’re aiming to reduce the carbon 
footprint from our packaging by 25% and 
achieve 100% circular plastics packaging 
(reused, recycled or repurposed) in  
consumer products.Our progress is tracked using a life cycle assessment 
tool that determines the equivalent carbon dioxide 
emissions for each packaging format. In addition, 84% 
of our plastic packaging is able to be reused, recycled 
or repurposed. To underscore our commitment to a 
circular plastics economy, we signed the New Plastics 
Economy Commitment led by the Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation to commit to creating circular plastic 
packaging to eliminate plastic pollution.Approach
84% of our plastic
