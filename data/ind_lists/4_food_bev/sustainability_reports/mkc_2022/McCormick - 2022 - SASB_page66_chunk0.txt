Collaborating with Purpose
McCormick has set ambitious targets to build 
resilient, sustainable farming communities 
and we recognize that to create long-lasting 
change we must collaborate with multiple 
stakeholders to leverage their experience 
and expertise to achieve our goals. We often 
partner with non-governmental organizations 
to provide assessments, training, infrastructure 
development and project management 
assistance in origin countries. Our major 
collaborations include those with IFC, NCBA 
CLUSA, CARE International, Heifer International 
and WWF .To create impact at scale, a number of 
McCormickâ€™s initiatives have been awarded 
funding from international development 
agencies such as USAID, USDA and GIZ, and to 
date have benefited nearly 23,000 farmers, their 
families and the wider farming communities. 
These relationships are vital to our ongoing 
success, driving greater impact at source, and 
delivering on our commitment to increase the 
resilience of 90% of smallholder farmers that 
grow our key iconic herbs and spices
