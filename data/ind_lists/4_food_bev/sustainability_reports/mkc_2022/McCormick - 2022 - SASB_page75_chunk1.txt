Cardaforestry in Guatemala
In partnership with Heifer International, a 
development organization committed to ending 
hunger and poverty around the world, McCormick 
is sourcing cardamom and allspice directly from 
farmer cooperatives through Guatemalan spice 
supplier Nueva Kerala. Heifer Internationalâ€™s impact 
investing arm provides financing for Nueva Kerala to 
purchase spices from 500 farmers in Alta Verapaz, 
Guatemala. In addition to financing, McCormick and 
Heifer International have partnered to implement 
the Cardaforestry project. We are working with 
smallholder farmers to support investments in 
energy-efficient dryers using electricity and solar energy instead of firewood. The dryers reduce 
the need for firewood, which leads to improved 
forest management and carbon-sequestration in 
the soil while reducing deforestation. By working 
directly with spice farmers, we are strengthening 
our cardamom and allspice supply chain, increasing 
farmer incomes and resilience and protecting 
forests in Guatemala. In collaboration with the 
Inter-American Development Bank, these cardamom 
farmer cooperatives will also access working capital 
to be able to purchase and process products from 
their member farmers.Supplier Diversity
