OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORTWe believe in our people. Standing together with our employees, we strive to create a great place to work that is 
engaging and rewarding. The development and wellness of our 14,000 global employees are critical components 
of how we do business and these efforts are part of how we measure success. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we took an employee-focused approach to prioritizing the health and safety of our employees – this was 
McCormick’s primary concern. We engaged our Employee Ambassadors Groups to provide feedback on policies 
and practices that were being considered for implementation. The discussions resulted in a number of innovative suggestions that involved opportunities with flexible work arrangements, technology and solutions for both 
child and elder care challenges. Beyond the pandemic, McCormick continues to invest in our people to ensure a 
culture of wellbeing among all employees. After two acquisitions and countless new hires during the past year, 
our team is still growing and working to meet the sustained demand for our products while executing our long-
term business growth and sustainability strategies.People
