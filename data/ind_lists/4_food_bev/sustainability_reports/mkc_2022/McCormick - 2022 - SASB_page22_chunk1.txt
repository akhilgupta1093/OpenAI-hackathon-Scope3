While we have achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 goal four years early, we are also elevating our greenhouse gas emissions targets from 2°C to 1 .5°C. With the submission of our 1 .50C target, we will join the UN 
Science-Based Targets initiatives Business Ambition for 1 .5°C, a global, cross-sector coalition of companies that have acknowledged the critical importance of limiting the impacts of climate change. The elevated 
goal also represents our commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050
