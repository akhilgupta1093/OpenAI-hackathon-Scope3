We have also developed a mental health toolkit for our 
non-corporate, front-line workers, to ensure company-
wide access and participation. Regular wellness 
screenings remain a priority as well. Through McCormick’s 
new wellness investments and long-held commitments, 
we’re demonstrating that wellness programs are not just 
benefits–they are an integral part of how we care for  
our employees.Wellness & Mental Health
