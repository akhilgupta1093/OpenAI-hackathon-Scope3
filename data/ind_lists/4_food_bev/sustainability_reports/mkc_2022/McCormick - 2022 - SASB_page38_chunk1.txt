These pulse surveys yield several key benefits, including:
• Near real-time measurement of employee engagement and satisfaction
• An accurate and comprehensive insight into employee attitude and engagement
• Allowance for analysis of improvements over time
• Direction for future employee engagement activities
• Frequent reminder that our leaders value employee feedback
• Promotion of culture of continuous improvement
