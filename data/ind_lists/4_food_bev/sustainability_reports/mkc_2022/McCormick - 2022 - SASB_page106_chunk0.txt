PLP REPORT
McCormick’s new Global Disruptive Innovation Team 
has been created to look internally and externally for 
category-wide disruptive packaging and technical 
innovations. Staffed cross-functionally, including 
representation from packaging, marketing, product R&D 
and supply chain, this team works together to harness 
innovative thinking and heighten its impact. 
While we’ve made strides to meet our packaging goals, 
our Global Disruptive Team has challenged to search for 
new materials, technologies, and processes to capture 
incremental environmental benefits from our package 
design process. 
A key area of focus for the team is finding new solutions 
to improve our packaging formats. For instance, 
packaging recyclability is a key consumer concern and 
working with leading packaging suppliers has allowed 
McCormick to develop recyclable solutions for our 
products, including fully recyclable packaging for our 
recipe mix line in the UK. In April 2021, McCormick Australia joined the 
RedcycleTM Product Stewardship Program, a sustainable 
packaging initiative designed to provide an innovative 
recovery and recycling solution for post-consumer 
flexible plastic packaging through a national network 
of retail drop-off points. As a result, all McCormick 
Foods packaging can now be diverted from landfills 
and recycled to build roads to support Australia’s 
infrastructure, as well as numerous outdoor products
