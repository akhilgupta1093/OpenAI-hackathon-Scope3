McCormick pursued immediate impacts through 
responsible construction practices and high-quality carbon 
offsets, while building a long-term approach through 
support for reforestation and a commitment to Net 
Zero operations at the Peterborough facility. Electricity 
at the Peterborough site will come from renewable 
sources, and the facility’s air-line cleaning system, water 
measurement and monitoring, solar panels and efficient 
refrigeration will advance the Company’s sustainability 
best practices. The Peterborough facility represents a 
blueprint for sustainable manufacturing for the firm’s 
global operations.40,000
