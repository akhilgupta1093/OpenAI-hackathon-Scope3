We also provided COVID-related health and hygiene training 
to almost 7 ,000 households, increased the scope of our 
clean water initiatives and piloted an improved watershed 
project to increase the water table in a drought-prone area of 
Tamil Nadu, India, and much more. Whether partnering with 
Heifer International to help Guatemalan farmers invest in 
energy-efficient dryers or continuing to provide leadership on the American Spice Trade Association, McCormick 
remains steadfast in support of farmers not only through our 
own actions but those undertaken and made more impactful 
through collaboration with industry peers and international 
organizations
