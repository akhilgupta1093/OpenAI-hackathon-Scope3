 
Michael has referred to McCormick’s PLP work as a “journey” and often draws upon 
his upbringing in a farming community in Nigeria, which first spurred his interest in 
sustainability: “When I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother, a subsistence farmer, 
worked and I saw what it took for her to really make enough money to support her four 
children after my dad passed away. For me, it was the formative years of my life that really 
had an impact, and that experience continues to benefit me today, especially in how I 
approach things and my view of sustainability. ”
 
For Michael, sustainability “is really a way of doing the right thing, whether you’re talking 
about our people, our farming communities or the planet we share. ”•  Under the direction of the President and CEO, responsible for the execution of the strategic business
