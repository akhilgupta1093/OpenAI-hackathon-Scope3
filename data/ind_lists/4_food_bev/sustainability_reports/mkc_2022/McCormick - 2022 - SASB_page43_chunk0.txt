OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE
2021
PLP REPORT
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick established critical benefits and safety protocols to ensure the 
health and wellbeing of our employees. These efforts were investments in essential employees across our supply 
chain. We increased hourly wages, extended sick leave to support family members and maintained salaries globally 
even if operations were suspended. We also immediately implemented remote working practices and tools for our 
office teams. All efforts provided employees with support and the ability to effectively manage the pandemic for 
themselves and their families.COVID-19
As an essential business, McCormick’s factory and distribution center locations have continued to operate during all 
stages of the pandemic. 
In addition to the premium pay for front-line workers, in the U.S., McCormick provided added flexibility for all 
employees to care for dependents, such as children unable to attend school or aging parents unable to access 
care facilities due to COVID-19. In the U.S., this included up to 5 days of 100% paid leave, followed by up to 11 
weeks at 2/3 pay, as well as support and flexibility through our new Caring Conversations initiative and benefit 
arrangements with care providers. Further, McCormick manufactured masks in China and sent them to the U.S. to 
be used as PPE. We hosted multiple vaccine clinics for employees and their families. As we emerge stronger from 
the pandemic, we know our success is a testament to the investments we’ve made in prioritizing the health and 
wellness of our employees. Notably, per a Pulse Survey, 76% of employees view the Company favorably and believe 
they have been supported during the pandemic.Investing in Our Employees
