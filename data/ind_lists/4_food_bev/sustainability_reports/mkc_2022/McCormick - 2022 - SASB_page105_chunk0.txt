•   We’ve evaluated the barrier properties of several potential mono-
polyethylene laminate (mono-PE) structures, which is a type of 
barrier film that is both flexible and recycle-ready . 
•  We are trialing a mono-PE recipe mix structure and have begun a 
shelf-life study with proposed mono-PE recipe mix structures.EMEA
•  We launched the spin grinder design for recyclability , which has led to 
a 7% reduction in our carbon footprint. 
•  We switched to 100% mono-material PP to improve packaging waste 
sorting. 
•  We completed first trial lines on “Première Saveur” new lightweight 
glass bottle design. 
•  We’re continuing the roll out of our First Choice glass bottle into the 
Eastern European market with its consumer-preferred transparent 
and functional design, modern looks and reinforcement of fresh 
flavor . So far , this has led to a 7% reduction in our carbon footprint. 
•  The switch to 100% recyclable recipe mix sachets will mean that 
compared to its original packaging, Schwartz is using 61% less plastic, 
and there will be a 30% reduction in the brand’s recipe mixes’ carbon 
footprint.APZ
•  In 2021, we joined the Redcycle™ Product Stewardship 
Program, established by the RED Group, which is designed  
to provide an innovative recovery and recycling solution  
for post-consumer flexible plastic packaging through  
a national network of retail drop off points. McCormick Foods pack -
aging can now be diverted from landfill and returned for recycling 
into Australian-made outdoor products and roads infrastructure for 
Australian communities
