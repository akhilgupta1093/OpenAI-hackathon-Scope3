Through the Power of Giving, our corporate, regional 
and country-specific initiatives come together under 
one unified global program to inspire and engage 
employees to support the causes they care about 
through matching gifts, volunteer time off and 
community service. Other programs include our 
Community Service Awards, Flavor for LifeTM  and others. In the U.S., Charity Day remains one of 
McCormickâ€™s longest-standing traditions. Every year 
for the last 80 years, McCormick employees have 
donated their time and monetary support to non-
profit organizations in the communities where we 
live and work. Throughout our month-long campaign, 
15 U.S. McCormick facilities across the country also 
hosted their own Charity Day events. 
In 2020, McCormick donated more than $10 million, 
which reflects increased support for the pandemic, 
across 22 countries. As part of our global response 
to COVID-19, we committed $3 million to supporting 
food banks in nearly 20 countries where we operate, 
as well as local restaurants and hospitality workers 
amid the pandemic. In 2021, we donated $8.2 million 
to causes around the world, which is in line with our 
typical annual giving.Philanthropy
