Finally, we are introducing McCormickâ€™s new global Power of Giving umbrella brand to help us tell the full story about how McCormick and our employees give back to communities. Through the Power of Giving, 
our corporate, regional and country-specific initiatives come together under one unified global program to inspire and engage employees to support the causes they care about through matching gifts, volunteer time 
off and community service. We now aim to have 80% of our employees globally participate in our Power of Giving program globally instead of the singular Charity Day event
