The creation of the Grown for Good standard took approximately one year from 
engagement to piloting the program. McCormick built upon our combined knowledge 
of the sector and related sustainability challenges, while capitalizing on strategic 
partnerships with suppliers at origin. The Grown for Good toolkit includes a step-by-step 
Implementation Guide and adapted surveys to gather data for developing a greater 
understanding. One of the most significant benefits of the program is the focus on 
group-level compliance, which alleviates some of the burden from individual farmers 
in terms of documentation and management practices. It is also founded upon the 
philosophy of continuous improvement, with the flexibility of allowing low-risk, highly 
motivated suppliers to focus their efforts on impact-oriented programs. While critical 
compliance criteria focus on fair labor practices, both on farms and in factories, and on 
sustainable farming practices, it also includes continuous improvement criteria focused 
on contributing to farmer resilience and women’s economic empowerment.Setting the rules with our own

The toolkit developed for herbs and spices provides step-by-step guides for 
implementers and auditors, enabling the Grown for Good standard to be 
replicated in any agricultural supply chain in McCormick’s portfolio, with the 
possibility of being extended to the wider industry. Our strategic partnerships 
will also facilitate the in-country training of trainers and auditors to ensure that 
standard implementation is efficient and independently verified.ABOUT
