PLP REPORT
Quality has been of paramount importance to McCormick since 
our beginning in 1889. Our founder, Willoughby M. McCormick, 
coined the motto “Make the best, someone will buy it. ” This is 
the earliest mention of a philosophy and guiding principle for 
our Company. McCormick is committed to product integrity – 
providing high quality products, with world class food safety 
standards, which are in full compliance with all legal and 
regulatory requirements in the markets in which they are sold. 
This obligation is captured in our “Taste You Trust®” principle.At McCormick, we know that delivering on this commitment 
will ensure we satisfy the expectations of our consumers 
and our customers. This is the accountability all McCormick 
employees, regardless of role, demonstrate every day through 
their behaviors. It’s the standard we expect from all others who 
work in and for our business. Our exacting standards start in 
the communities around the world from which we source and 
continue all the way until our flavors reach the table. McCormick 
leaders commit to creating a culture that demands excellence 
and continuous improvement in quality performance, provides 
the governance, systems and tools for enablement, and the 
opportunity for all to contribute the best of themselves in our 
best-in-class quality pursuit.Food Safety
