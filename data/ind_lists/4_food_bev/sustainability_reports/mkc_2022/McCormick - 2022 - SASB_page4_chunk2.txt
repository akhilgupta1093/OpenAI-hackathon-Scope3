The report outlines our efforts and performance related 
to sustainability under our three PLP focus areas: People, 
Communities and Planet. Topics reported under these areas are driven by our updated materiality assessment, which 
includes in-depth internal and external stakeholder interviews, 
as well as an industry landscape assessment. Within our 
report sections, topics core to McCormickâ€™s sustainability 
performance are mapped to widely used sustainability 
reporting frameworks including Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UN SDGs). In addition, we include individual sections 
describing our engagement with our stakeholders, our PLP 
governance and our updated materiality assessment matrix 
and methodology
