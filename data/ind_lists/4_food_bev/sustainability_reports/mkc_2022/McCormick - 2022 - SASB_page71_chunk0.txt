PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
McCormick France Employees Send Donations to 
Vanilla Farming Communities
In 2020, employees from McCormick mobilized over 6 metric tons of supplies intended for 
children in vanilla farming communities. They were distributed during the Christmas holidays 
and complemented other investments by McCormick to restore schools and provide access to education in these communities. This initiative strengthens McCormickâ€™s program with these 
communities and also galvanizes McCormick employees at home by providing meaning to their 
work and increasing their sense of ownership in the Company
