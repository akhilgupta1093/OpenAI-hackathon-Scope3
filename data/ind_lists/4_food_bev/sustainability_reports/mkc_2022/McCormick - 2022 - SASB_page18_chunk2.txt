Gender Equality
McCormick is proud to demonstrate our commitment 
to gender equality through women’s empowerment 
initiatives and tangible corporate goals like 50% of 
women in leadership positions globally. We have 
implemented an integrated global approach to gender 
equality and women’s economic empowerment in our 
iconic raw material supply chains and remain committed 
to our diversity and inclusion efforts companywide. 
We have partnered with the National Association of 
Manufacturing (NAM) on the STEP Ahead Initiative to 
recognize and highlight women at McCormick. Additionally, 
we have expanded our external partnerships with 
organizations like the Women’s Foodservice Forum 
and LEAD UK to increase the development and hiring of 
female talent. In 2018, we made a commitment to expand 
our pay equity and increase transparency around our 
discussions of the topic
