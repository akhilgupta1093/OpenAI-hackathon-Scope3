McCormick uses the World Resource Instituteâ€™s 
Aqueduct Water Risk tool to understand water stress 
in the geographies where the Company operates. 
McCormick also engages third parties with robust 
capabilities for identifying water savings and efficiency. 
These parties have identified a number of water 
saving opportunities we are currently working to implement. Notably, our Springfield, Missouri, facility 
has reduced water used in its processes based on 
the recommendations. A new wastewater treatment 
systems installed at our Peterborough, UK facility will 
help us to manage our wastewater more effectively. 
We have comprehensive wastewater effluent 
monitoring programs at our McKutas facility in Izmir, 
Turkey; McPesa in Mexico City, Mexico; Stefanowo, 
Poland; Wuhan, Shanghai and Guangzhou, China; Hunt 
Valley, Maryland, U.S., and Clayton, Australia, ensure 
compliance and result in efficient and proper operation 
of our wastewater treatment systems. Our McCormick 
facility at Palmwoods in Queensland, Australia, has been 
fitted to capture and reuse rainwater
