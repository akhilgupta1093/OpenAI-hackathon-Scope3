PLP REPORT
Vanilla is one of the five branded iconic ingredients on 
a journey to be sourced sustainably and ethically by 
McCormick. As part of this effort, we are launching a 
new vanilla blockchain initiative under our Vahiné® brand 
for further control and transparency for consumers, in 
partnership with Wholechain. The blockchain approach 
will allow consumers to scan a QR code on Vahiné® vanilla product packaging, which launches Vahiné®'s commitment 
landing page. It allows consumers to trace the product 
back to its initial cultivation zone and provides details 
including when the vanilla had been sold to the co-op. This 
is the first blockchain project for McCormick, and Vahiné® 
is among the first brands to implement a blockchain 
approach on vanilla in France.Vanilla Transparency for Consumers
