OUR COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE

PLP REPORT
The reason I enlisted in the United States Air Force was patriotism, my family, 
my love of God and country, plus my desire to see the world. While serving, 
I was fortunate enough to travel around the world and live in many different 
countries, which really started my diversity and inclusion education–something 
that wasn’t a term 40 years ago. Travelling and experiencing different cultures 
gives Veterans a unique perspective and provides McCormick with the 
opportunity to utilize your experiences to strengthen our Company. The military 
is really a family that you have for life, and this is similar to how I feel about the EAGs. Leading the U.S. Veterans EAG has allowed me to build a network 
and make connections with others I might not have met. I’m amazed by the 
expertise of our members, and I have been able to reach out and learn new 
processes and ways of working at McCormick from them. This EAG also 
allows me to help in recruiting, mentoring and retaining Veteran employees at 
McCormick, which I know will have a positive business impact to help build a 
vibrant and more diverse company.DENISE

My time with the Asian Diversity Group has been filled with absolutely 
priceless memories and a phenomenal opportunity to interact with leadership 
not found anywhere else in the Company. Because of my time with the EAGs, 
I’ve gained trusted friends, two amazing mentors and the opportunity to be 
part of a group that helped our plant and essential workers feel cared for and 
included, not only here but in all plants and DCs across North America. We 
have helped school children in India through our donations. And finally, since I’m always going to be Chef Gabby regardless of my other roles, we get to 
experience food from all across Asia together. My experience with the EAGs 
has been nothing short of amazing and I’m thankful to be part of the changes 
that have helped McCormick be the great company that it is for now and for 
the next 130 years and beyond.GABBY
