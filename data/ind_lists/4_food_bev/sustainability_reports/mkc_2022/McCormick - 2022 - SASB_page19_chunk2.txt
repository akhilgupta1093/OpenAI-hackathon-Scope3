Decent Work & Economic Growth
McCormick has recently been recognized as a UN Global 
Compact LEAD company for our ongoing commitment to 
the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles for responsible 
business. As a member of the UN Global Compact, we have 
joined the Decent Work in Global Supply Chains action 
platform and are committed to implementing universal 
sustainability principles that meet fundamental responsibilities 
in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-
corruption. In addition to aligning with basic working conditions 
and human rights concepts advanced by international 
organizations such as the International Labor Organization 
and the United Nations Global Compact on Human Rights, 
McCormickâ€™s new Global Human Rights Policy represents 
our own minimum standards for working conditions and 
human rights that applies to our employees, customers, 
communities and business partners. These include 
standards of nondiscrimination and harassment; freedom of 
association, work environment and compensation; protecting 
employee privacy; prohibiting forced labor and child labor; 
and promoting safety and health. Additionally, as part of our 
commitment to our farming communities, we work with our 
suppliers to increase the direct economic benefits generated 
by farmers through improved farming practices and other 
value-added activities
