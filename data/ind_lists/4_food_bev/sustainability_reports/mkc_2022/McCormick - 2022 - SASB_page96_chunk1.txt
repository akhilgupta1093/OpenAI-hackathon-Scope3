Renewable energy purchases for two sites in the UK stretching 
back to October 2019 and three sites in Italy since April 2021 
has contributed to a 50% reduction in emissions in our EMEA 
operations compared to 2015 levels. We are investing additional 
renewable energy purchases to improve our emissions in 
Europe and continue to shrink the footprint associated with the 
energy we consume
