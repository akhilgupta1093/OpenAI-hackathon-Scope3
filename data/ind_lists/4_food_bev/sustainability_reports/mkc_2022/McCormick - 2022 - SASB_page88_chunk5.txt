Sourcing with purpose not only positively impacts 
the planet and our stakeholders, it also supports our 
business and benefits the industry. Our Grown for Good 
standard has been specifically designed for the herbs 
and spices sector, which sources the vast majority of 
crops from smallholder farmers. It focuses on building 
resilient production systems through regenerative 
agriculture, biodiversity and ecosystem services, and 
water conservation. The implementation of the standard 
is verified through third-party audits and has been 
designed to ease the administrative burden on farmers, 
instead concentrating time and resources on continuous 
improvement.Grown for Good: Sourcing with Purpose
