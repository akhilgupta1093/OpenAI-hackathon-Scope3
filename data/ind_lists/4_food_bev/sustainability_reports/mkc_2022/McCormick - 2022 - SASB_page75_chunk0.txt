Sustainable Supply Chain Finance Initiative
McCormick partnered with IFC, a member 
of the World Bank Group, and Citi to provide 
McCormick suppliers with financial incentives 
linked to improvements in measures of social and 
environmental sustainability. The program began 
with suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam. Through 
this program, our suppliers become eligible for 
discounted interest rates on short-term working 
capital financing by meeting Grown for Good criteria, and measuring performance on labor conditions, 
health and safety practices, crop management, 
environmental impact, farmer resilience and 
women’s empowerment. The higher the supplier’s 
performance level, the more they potentially save. 
Overall, the program provides incentive for suppliers 
to help McCormick achieve our Purpose-led 
Performance goals
