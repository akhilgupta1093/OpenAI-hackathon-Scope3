TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
2021
PLP REPORTMcCormick continues to deliver robust growth and is performing at the top tier of the food and 
flavor industry. We recently joined the Fortune 500 due to our focus on organic growth and the 
successful execution of our strategies and additions of our newest acquisitions, Cholula® Hot 
Sauce and FONA International. We are proud of our sustained performance and being included 
on this prestigious list. I’d like to thank our 14,000 employees around the world for the focus 
and dedication to driving our business, even during the global pandemic. Our commitment 
to improving the lives of people and doing what’s right has never been stronger. I’m proud 
of our progress on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives where we’ve increased the 
representation of women and ethnically diverse talent throughout the organization. Our focus on 
Human Rights and ensuring fair Labor practices have also been outlined in this report. The global 
pandemic has highlighted the need for an increased focus on health and nutrition and we have
a commitment to help people live healthier lives and create a healthier world. We will accomplish 
this by continuing to educate others about the health benefits of culinary herbs and spices and by 
providing more information about all-natural flavor options that can reduce salt, sugar and fat and 
positively impact health outcomes
