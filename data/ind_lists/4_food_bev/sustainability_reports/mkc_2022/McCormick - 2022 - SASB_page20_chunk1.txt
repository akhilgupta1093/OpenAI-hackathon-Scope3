Responsible Consumption & 
Production
McCormick is committed to promoting sustainable 
consumption and production, which is evident in our 
innovative approach to developing sustainable packaging 
across geographies. Our goals include a reduction of 
our carbon footprint from packaging by 25% and 
100% circular plastics packaging (reused, recycled 
or repurposed) by 2025. We have also signed the 
New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, led by the 
Ellen MacArthur Foundation, to underscore our role in 
promoting a circular economy. We are removing all 
problematic plastics within our products and developing 
more sustainable packaging. This includes the use of 
recycled content into PET bottles and HPDPE mustard 
bottles. Additionally, we are aiming for 80% recycling 
and recovery of solid waste from our facilities. We 
have worked with NGOs and donor partners  to design 
comprehensive development programs in Madagascar and 
Indonesia to help farmers diversify their income sources, 
maintain forests, improve biodiversity and protect soil 
health. We are also committed to sourcing all herbs and 
spices in our portfolio sustainability, beginning with 100% of 
our branded iconic ingredients. ABOUT
