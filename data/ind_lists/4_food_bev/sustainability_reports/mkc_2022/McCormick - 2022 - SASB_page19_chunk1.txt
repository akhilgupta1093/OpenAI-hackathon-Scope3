Affordable & Clean Energy
McCormick is aggressively pursuing the use of clean energy
throughout its operations. In 2021, we joined the leading
global corporations committed to limiting climate warming to 
1.50C by 2030 and to achieving Net Zero by 2050. We’re also 
increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 
through initiatives such as the development of our Peterborough Net 
Zero facility. We use 100% renewable electricity to power all three 
of our UK facilities and have contracts to do the same in Poland and 
Italy. Through projects with the Skipjack and Big Star solar facilities, 
we also use 100% renewable electricity to power our Maryland and 
New Jersey facilities, as well as our Dallas, Texas, manufacturing 
plant and distribution center. While we’ve achieved our 2025 
Scope 1 and 2 goals four years early, our new corporate goals 
include a 42% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
(Scope 1 and Scope 2) from our facilities by 2030. We are 
also targeting a 42% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions (Scope 3) by 2030. Furthermore, we are educating our 
suppliers on greenhouse gas emissions and how they can set their 
own reduction targets. McCormick continues to grow our significant 
use of renewable electricity in North America and Europe. We have 
a dedicated Environmental Policy and support the Paris Agreement 
and other national, regional and local solutions to address climate 
change and make renewable energy more accessible
