CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO IMPROVEMENT (OUR GOALS)
2021
PLP REPORT
In our 2017 PLP report, we outlined a series of commitments and 14 clear PLP 
goals, which align with and support the UN SDGs. Since then, we’ve added 
two additional performance targets to our set of goals. Our PLP approach 
recognizes that sustainability is a journey, allowing us to continuously build  
on our success and raise our ambitions as our business and operating 
landscapes change. In line with our focus on doing what’s right for the planet, we are excited to 
announce a new commitment to limit overall warming to 1 .50C, an elevation 
of our existing 2 degree goal, pending approval of the Science Based Target 
initiative (SBTi), which is part of our long-term commitment to achieve Net 
Zero by 2050. More on this target update and others follows. To demonstrate 
stakeholder transparency, we have formally contextualized our commitment to 
the 13 UN SDGs directly supported by our PLP goals.—   CONTINUED COMMITMENT
