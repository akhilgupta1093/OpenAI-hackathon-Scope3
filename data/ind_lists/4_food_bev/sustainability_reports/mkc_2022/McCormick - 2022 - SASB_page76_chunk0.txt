PLP REPORTOUR COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITIES
In addition to McCormick’s efforts to advance women 
in the workplace, we are committed to helping women 
thrive across our broader supply chain. We measure 
increased farmer resilience through increased skills 
and capacity, greater income, more access to financial services, education and better nutrition and health 
outcomes. Under this goal, we’re also piloting an 
integrated global approach to gender equality and 
women’s economic empowerment in our farming 
communities.Empowering Women
Women play a critical role in agricultural supply chains, 
yet often have unequal access to opportunities, assets 
and resources. Women are disproportionately affected 
by poverty, which in turn affects their levels of hun-
ger, health and access to clean water and sanitation. 
However, research has shown that when women have 
control of their income, it is more likely to be spent on 
healthcare, improved nutrition for their children and 
investments in their child’s education. In addition, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the gender gap, 
according to estimations by the World Economic Forum.Since 2018, we have partnered with CARE Impact 
Partners (“CIP”), a division of CARE International that 
supports companies in building resilient enterprises 
and delivering social impact, to map the roles of 
women in the farming communities from which we 
source. These analyses reinforced our belief that 
women are involved in every aspect of herbs and 
spices cultivation, while also maintaining responsibility 
for the majority of unpaid work such as childcare 
and household responsibilities. It was clear that 
opportunities existed for programming to address the 
gender imbalance; however, the challenge remained 
of how to measure the impact these initiatives would 
have on women’s empowerment.Uplifting Communities
