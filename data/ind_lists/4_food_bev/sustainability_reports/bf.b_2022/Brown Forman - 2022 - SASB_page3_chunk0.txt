In 2021, Brown Forman formalized new commitments on packaging to guide strategies 
to reduce the environmental impact of our packaging throughout its lifecycle. We are 
committed to 100% of primary packaging being recyclable or reusable by 2030, eliminating 
unnecessary and problematic materials and implementing circular product systems, 
significantly increasing the recycled content of product packaging materials by 2030
