If droughts become more common or severe, or if our water supply were 
interrupted for other reasons, high-quality water could become scarce in some 
key production regions for our products, including Tennessee, Kentucky, 
California, Finland, Scotland, Ireland, and Mexico, which in turn could adversely 
affect our business and financial results. Also within our supply chain, we utilize 
co-packers for final completion of products. These facilities, while outside our 
operational control, rely upon high-quality water to carry out their services. 
Any disruption to their operations could impact the production and delivery of 
products
