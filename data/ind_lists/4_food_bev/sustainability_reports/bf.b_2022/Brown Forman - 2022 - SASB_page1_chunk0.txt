management risks and 
discussion of strategies and 
practices to mitigate those risksWater is an essential component of our products, so the quality and quantity 
of available water is important to our ability to operate our business. Globally, 
our company faces some direct risks associated with water scarcity due to the 
location of our operations and the requirements for water in our production 
processes and finished products. This risk stems from constraints on the 
available quantity, quality, and cost of water supplies across our enterprise. 
However, the majority of our operations are not located in high or extremely 
high baseline water stress areas
