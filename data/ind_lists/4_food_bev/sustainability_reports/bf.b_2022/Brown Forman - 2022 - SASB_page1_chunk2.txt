To manage water risk, we have completed watershed risk assessments to 
evaluate watersheds we operate in that are considered at-risk or business-
critical. Following the assessments, we have begun to develop multi-year 
mitigation plans to address risk. We also continue to focus on operational 
improvements in our use of water. 
We have formalized new water stewardship commitments to protect the health 
of key watersheds in our communities and create Net Positive Water Impact 
in water-stressed basins where we operate, so that all watershed users have 
sufficient access to the amount and quality of water that meets their needs.FB-AB-140a.2
