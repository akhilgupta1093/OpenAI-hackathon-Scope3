In 2022, we completed a Human Rights and Modern Slavery risk assessment of 
our global supply chains. Based on the results of this risk assessment, a Human 
Rights committee was formed to develop and implement an improvement 
strategy to reduce the social risks and impacts of our supply chain.

While this metric reflects the range of our agricultural inputs sourced from 
high water-stressed regions, including agave, the agave plants do not require 
significant water for growth and are not known to contribute to water stress in

List of priority beverage 
ingredients and description 
of sourcing risks due to 
environmental and social 
considerationsPriority Beverage Ingredients: Agave, Barley, Corn, Grapes, Malted Barley, Rye, and 
Wood. From time to time, our priority beverage ingredients could be adversely 
affected by weather and other forces out of our control that might constrain 
supply or reduce our inventory below desired levels for optimum production. 
The effects of climate change, fires, diseases, and other agricultural 
uncertainties that affect the mortality, health, yield, quality, or price of the 
various raw materials used in our products also present risks for our business, 
including in some cases potential impairment in the recorded value of our 
inventory. Changes in weather patterns or intensity can disrupt our supply chain 
as well, which may affect production operations, insurance costs and coverage, 
and the timely delivery of our products
