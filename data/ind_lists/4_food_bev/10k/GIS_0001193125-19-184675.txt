PART I 

ITEM
1

Business 

General Mills, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1928. The terms “General Mills,” “Company,” “registrant,” “we,”
“us,” and “our” mean General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report unless the context indicates otherwise. 

Certain terms used throughout this report are defined in a glossary in Item 8 of this report. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW 

We are a leading global manufacturer
and marketer of branded consumer foods sold through retail stores. We also are a leading supplier of branded and unbranded food products to the North American foodservice and commercial baking industries. Following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo
Pet Products, Inc. (Blue Buffalo) in fiscal 2018, we are also a leading manufacturer and marketer in the wholesome natural pet food category. We manufacture our products in 13 countries and market them in more than 100 countries. In addition to our
consolidated operations, we have 50
percent interests in two strategic joint ventures that manufacture and market food products sold in more than 130 countries worldwide. 

We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing effectively on all brands and across all
geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent 
in-store
 execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms, which are 

Häagen-Dazs

 ice cream, snack bars, 
Old El Paso
 Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing acquisitions and
divestitures.
We believe executing against this growth framework should result in long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
 
As part of our
portfolio shaping strategy, in fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0
billion. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0
billion in debt, $1.0
billion in equity, and cash on hand.
The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our Pet operating segment on a 
one-month
 lag. In fiscal 2018, our Consolidated Statements of Earnings did not include Pet operating segment results. For
further information on the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
We manage
and review the financial results of our business under five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores
& Foodservice; Europe
& Australia; Asia
& Latin America; and Pet. See Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) in Item 7 of this report for a description of our segments. 
 
We offer a variety
of food products that provide great taste, nutrition, convenience, and value for consumers around the world. Our business is focused on the following large, global categories: 

[TABLE]

snacks, including grain, fruit and savory snacks, nutrition bars, and frozen hot snacks;

[/TABLE]

Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) joint venture with Nestlé S.A. (Nestlé) competes in the 

ready-to-eat

 cereal category in markets outside North America, and our 
Häagen-Dazs
 Japan, Inc. (HDJ) joint venture competes in the super-premium ice cream category
in Japan. For net sales contributed by each class of similar products, please see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Customers.

Our primary customers are grocery stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, natural food chains, drug, dollar and
discount chains, 
e-commerce
 retailers, commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators, restaurants, convenience stores, and pet specialty stores. We generally sell to these customers
through our direct sales force. We use broker and distribution arrangements for certain products and to serve certain types of customers. For further information on our customer credit and product return practices, please refer to Note 2 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. During fiscal 2019, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (Walmart) accounted for 20
percent of our consolidated net sales and 31
percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. No other customer accounted for 10
percent or more of our consolidated net sales. For further information on significant customers, please refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Competition.

The packaged foods categories are highly competitive, with numerous manufacturers of varying sizes in the United States and
throughout the world. The categories in which we participate also are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded products. Competitors market and sell their products
through 

brick-and-mortar

 stores and 
e-commerce.
 All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other
resources. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the
ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective customer relationships, superior product quality, innovative advertising, product
promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers’ needs, an efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic
and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Internationally, we compete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors. 

Raw materials, ingredients, and packaging. 

The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), dairy products, sugar,
fruits, vegetable oils, meats, nuts, vegetables, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board, corrugated, plastic and metal packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. Most of these inputs for our
domestic and Canadian operations are purchased from suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may be imported from other countries. The cost of these inputs may
fluctuate widely due to external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and
regulations. We have some long-term fixed price contracts, but the majority of our inputs are purchased on the open market. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make
advance purchases of items significant to our business in order to ensure continuity of operations. Our objective is to procure materials meeting both our quality standards and our production needs at price levels that allow a targeted profit
margin. Since these inputs generally represent the largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price movements for some inputs using a variety of risk management
strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides 

4 

Table of Contents

us efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds physical inventories that are carried at net realizable value
and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its market exposures. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Our research and development resources are focused on new product development, product improvement, process design and improvement, packaging, and exploratory
research in new business and technology areas. Research and development expenditures were $222
million in fiscal 2019 and $219
million in fiscal 2018.

. We protect these marks as appropriate through registrations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their
registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use. 

Some of our products are marketed under or in combination with trademarks that have been licensed from others for both long-standing products (e.g.,

Reese’s Puffs
 for cereal, 
Green Giant 
for vegetables in certain countries, and 
Cinnabon
 for refrigerated dough, frozen pastries, and baking products) and shorter term promotional products (e.g., fruit snacks sold under
various third party equities). 
 
Our cereal trademarks are licensed to CPW and may be used in association with the 
Nestlé 
trademark.
Nestlé licenses certain of its trademarks to CPW, including the 
Nestlé
 and 
Uncle Toby’s
 trademarks. The 

Häagen-Dazs

 trademark is licensed royalty-free and
exclusively to Nestlé for ice cream and other frozen dessert products in the United States and Canada. The 

Häagen-Dazs

 trademark is also licensed to HDJ. The 
Pillsbury
 brand and the

Pillsbury Doughboy
 character are subject to an exclusive, royalty-free license that was granted to a third party and its successors in the dessert mix and baking mix categories in the United States and under limited circumstances in Canada
and Mexico. 
 
The 
Yoplait
 trademark and other related trademarks are owned by Yoplait Marques SNC, an entity in which we own a 50
percent
interest. These marks are licensed exclusively to Yoplait SAS, an entity in which we own a 51
percent interest. Yoplait SAS licenses these trademarks to its franchisees. The 
Liberté 
trademark and other related trademarks are owned
by Liberté Marques Sàrl, an entity in which we own a 50
percent interest. 
 
We continue our focus on developing and marketing
innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our
businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. 

SEASONALITY 

In general, demand for our products is evenly balanced throughout the year. However, within our North America Retail segment demand for refrigerated dough,
frozen baked goods, and baking products is stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand for 
Progresso 
soup is higher during the fall and winter months. Internationally, within 

5 

Table of Contents

our Europe
& Australia and Asia
& Latin America segments, demand for 

Häagen-Dazs
 
ice cream is higher during the summer months
and demand for baking mix and dough products increases during winter months. Due to the offsetting impact of these demand trends, as well as the different seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres, our international segments’ net sales
are generally evenly balanced throughout the year. 

BACKLOG 

Orders are generally filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders as
of May
26, 2019, was not material. 

WORKING CAPITAL 

A description of our working capital is included in the Liquidity section of MD&A in Item 7 of this report. Our product return practices are described in
Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of May
26, 2019, we had approximately 40,000 full- and part-time employees. 

QUALITY AND SAFETY REGULATION 

The manufacture and sale
of consumer and pet food products is highly regulated. In the United States, our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade
Commission, Department of Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the United States. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

As of May
26, 2019, we were
involved with two active cleanup sites associated with the alleged or threatened release of hazardous substances or wastes located in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moonachie, New Jersey. 

Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and all similar state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations applicable to the jurisdictions in which we operate. 

Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe that neither the results of our environmental proceedings nor our compliance in general with
environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

ITEM

Risk Factors 

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our
results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal
competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through

brick-and-mortar

 stores and 
e-commerce.
 All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other
resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product
categories is based on 

8 

Table of Contents

product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to
identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the
same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new
product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products. 

We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. 

There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers
may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional
programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively
impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2019, Walmart accounted for 20
percent of our consolidated net sales and 31
percent of net sales of our North America Retail
segment. PetSmart and Petco accounted for 36
percent and 14
percent, respectively, of our Pet segment’s net sales in fiscal 2019. National pet superstore chains have experienced reduced store traffic. If national pet superstore chains
continue to experience reduced store traffic, or experience any operational difficulties, our Pet segment operating results may be adversely affected. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our
profitability. 

The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as
weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected
increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in
commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend. 

Volatility in the market value of derivatives we
use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. 

We utilize derivatives to
manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in
earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating
results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile
earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 

If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the
highly competitive environment in which we operate. 

Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the
production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more

difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability
and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively
impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any
of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

Disruption of our supply chain could adversely
affect our business. 

Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our
manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemic, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability
to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Failure to take adequate steps to
mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations,
as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain. 

Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to
avoid certain food products or ingredients. 

We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and
quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. 

If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers
or their pets are injured. 

We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product
recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability
judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business
results and the value of our brands. 

We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand
for our products. 

Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to
offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to
anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging 
e-commerce
 channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for
our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified
organisms, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.

We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable
categories. 

The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our
business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also
depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. 

Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. 

The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase
more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In
addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase
products from our Convenience Stores
& Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. 

Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in
large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse
publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers.
Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or
misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands,
our business results could be negatively impacted. 

Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. 

In fiscal 2019, 26
percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks
relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: 

[TABLE]

•

political and economic instability; 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

exchange controls and currency exchange rates;

[TABLE]

•

tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export;

Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange
rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican
peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. 

New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. 

Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and
the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our
products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products,
including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of
operations to be adversely affected. 
 
We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to
comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties
inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that
our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay
dividends. 

As of May
26, 2019, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $15.4
billion. The agreements under
which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: 

[TABLE]

•

ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate
purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a
downturn in general economic conditions. 

[/TABLE] 
There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and
noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative
financing may also be adversely affected. 
 
Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our
operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.

Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of
borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. 

We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to
fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no
assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are
not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets
or a slowdown in the general economy. 
 
From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into
interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements,
and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. 

We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various
foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of
securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause
volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from
operations. 

Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. 

Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and
systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are
critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external
communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some
of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures,
telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems,
as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing
inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may
have a material adverse effect on our business.

A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different
weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. 

As of May
26, 2019, we had $20.6
billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of
the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are
determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. Our Latin America and U.S. Yogurt reporting units have experienced
declining business performance and we continue to monitor these businesses. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment
losses. 
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the 
Blue Buffalo
, 
Pillsbury
,

Totino’s

Progresso
, 
Yoplait
, 
Old El
 
Paso
, 
Yoki
, 

Häagen-Dazs

,
 
and
 Annie’s 
brands, to determine if they are finite or
indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known
technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related
groups of assets. 
 
Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable
if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. Our 
Pillsbury
, 
Yoki
,
 
and
 Progresso 
brands have experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on
goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

We may fail to realize all
of the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. 

Our ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Blue Buffalo, which is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. We had not operated in the pet food sector prior to the
acquisition of Blue Buffalo and our lack of experience in this sector may hinder our ability to manage Blue Buffalo successfully following the acquisition. 

The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure
to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of the Blue Buffalo acquisition could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
In addition, the integration of Blue Buffalo may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses,
liabilities, competitive responses, and loss of customers and other business relationships. Additional integration challenges include: 

[TABLE]

•

diversion of management’s attention to integration matters; 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, and growth prospects from
the acquisition;

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

the impact of potential liabilities we may be inheriting from Blue Buffalo; and 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

coordinating a geographically dispersed organization. 

[/TABLE]

Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and
diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in us becoming subject to litigation. In addition, even if Blue Buffalo is integrated successfully,
the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.
Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration process. All of these factors could cause reductions in our earnings per share and decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition. As a result, it cannot
be assured that the Blue Buffalo acquisition will result in the realization of the full or any anticipated benefits. 

Blue Buffalo may underperform
relative to our expectations. 

The business, prospects, and financial performance of Blue Buffalo are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties.
We may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and Blue Buffalo have achieved or might achieve separately.
Our failure to do so could have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. When we acquired Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2018, we recorded significant brand intangible and goodwill assets at fair value based on, among other things, our projections of Blue
Buffalo’s financial performance. Our failure to meet or exceed our projections could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including a material impairment to our intangible assets. 

Our failure to successfully integrate other acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. 

From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our
ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of
key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve
anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

We are a global packaged foods company. We develop distinctive value-added food products and market them under unique brand names. We work continuously to
improve our core products and to create new products that meet consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. In addition, we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer-directed marketing, innovative new products, and effective
merchandising. We believe our brand-building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe. 
 
Our
fundamental financial goal is to generate superior returns for our shareholders over the long term. We believe that increases in organic net sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and cash return to
shareholders are key drivers of financial performance for our business. 
 
Our long-term growth objectives are to consistently deliver: 

[TABLE]

•

low single-digit annual growth in organic net sales; 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

mid single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

high single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted EPS; 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

free cash flow conversion averaging above 95
percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

•

cash return to shareholders averaging above 90
percent of free cash flow, including an attractive
dividend yield. 

[/TABLE] 
We continue to pursue our Consumer First strategy and execute against our global growth framework: 1) competing
effectively on all brands and across all geographies through strong innovation, effective consumer marketing, and excellent 
in-store
 execution; 2) accelerating growth on our four differential growth platforms,
which are 

Häagen-Dazs

 ice cream, snack bars, 
Old El Paso
 Mexican food, and our portfolio of natural and organic food brands; and 3) reshaping our portfolio through growth-enhancing
acquisitions and divestitures, including the acquisition of Blue Buffalo.
By focusing on this growth framework, we expect to generate financial performance consistent with the long-term growth objectives listed above, which we believe should
result in long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
 
In fiscal 2019 we executed well and met or exceeded each of our key full-year financial targets,
including organic net sales growth and constant-currency growth in net sales, adjusted operating profit, and adjusted diluted EPS. Relative to fiscal 2018, we improved our net sales performance in U.S. Yogurt and our emerging market businesses, we
increased our contributions from innovation, we stabilized our distribution trends in the U.S., and we generated greater benefits from net price realization and mix through our Strategic Revenue Management capability. These results were partially
offset by challenging performance for U.S. snack bars, leaving our organic net sales growth at the low end of the range outlined in our initial annual targets. 

We successfully transitioned Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio in fiscal 2019, achieving our goals of double-digit pro forma growth in net sales
and segment operating profit excluding the impact of purchase accounting. The combination of record-level Holistic Margin Management (HMM) savings, increased benefits from net price realization and mix, and strong cost management drove growth in
constant-currency adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS ahead of our initial targets. Finally, we continued to maintain a disciplined focus on cash, resulting in another year of strong free cash flow conversion. 

Our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 rose 7
percent to $16.9
billion. On an organic basis, net sales essentially matched 
year-ago
 levels. Operating profit of $2.5
billion increased 4
percent. Adjusted operating profit of $2.8
billion increased 9
percent and increased 10
percent on a constant-currency
basis.
Diluted EPS of $2.90 was down 20
percent compared to fiscal 2018 results. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 4
percent to $3.22 per share and increased 4
percent on a constant-currency basis (See the 
“Non-GAAP
 Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)).

Net cash provided by operations totaled $2.8
billion in fiscal 2019 representing a conversion rate of
157
percent of net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests. This cash generation supported capital investments totaling $538
million, and our resulting free cash flow was $2.3
billion at a
conversion rate of 115
percent of adjusted net earnings, including earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling interests.
We also returned cash to shareholders through dividends totaling $1.2
billion and reduced total debt
outstanding by $1.3
billion. 
 
A detailed review of our fiscal 2019 performance compared to fiscal 2018 appears below in the section titled
“Fiscal 2019 Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance compared to our fiscal 2017 performance is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 
10-K
 for the
fiscal year ended May
27, 2018 under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Fiscal 2018 Results of Consolidated Operations.” 

In fiscal 2020, our plans include continued strong innovation and investments in capabilities and brand building to accelerate our topline growth, efficiency
initiatives to maintain our strong margins, and a disciplined focus on cash to further reduce our leverage. We remain confident that executing our Consumer First strategy and our Compete, Accelerate, and Reshape growth framework will drive
sustainable, profitable growth and attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.

FISCAL 2019 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

In fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating segment. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a 
one-month
 lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results. 
 
In fiscal 2019,
net sales increased 7
percent compared to last year, primarily reflecting the addition of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales were flat in the fiscal year ended May
26, 2019. Operating profit margin of 14.9
percent was down 50 basis
points from 
year-ago
 levels primarily driven by impairment charges recorded for certain intangible and manufacturing assets and unfavorable

mark-to-market

 valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 16.9
percent, primarily driven by lower
selling, general, and administrative expenses in our North America Retail segment and the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by higher input costs. Diluted earnings per share of $2.90 decreased 20
percent primarily driven by a 
one-time
 benefit recorded in fiscal 2018 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.22 increased 4
percent on a constant-currency basis (see the 
“Non-GAAP
 Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP).

Measured in tons based on the stated weight of our product shipments. 

[/TABLE]

The 7
percent increase in net sales in fiscal 2019 reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, favorable net price realization and mix across all other
segments, and higher contributions from volume growth in the Asia
& Latin America segment, partially offset by lower contributions from volume growth in the North America Retail, Europe
& Australia, and Convenience
Stores
& Foodservice segments.

[/TABLE]

Organic net sales in fiscal 2019 were flat compared to fiscal 2018, as favorable organic net price realization and mix was offset by declining contributions
from organic volume growth. 

Cost of sales 
increased $804
million in fiscal 2019 to $11,108
million. The increase was driven by a
$503
million increase due to higher volume and a $194
million increase attributable to product rate and mix, including the impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $53
million charge related to the fair
value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We recorded a $36
million net increase in cost of sales related to 

mark-to-market

 valuation
of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a net decrease of $32
million in fiscal 2018 (please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report). In fiscal 2019, we recorded $10
million of
restructuring charges in cost of 

21 

Table of Contents

sales compared to $14
million in fiscal 2018. We also recorded $1
million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019 compared to $11
million
in fiscal 2018 (please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
8 of this report for additional information). 

Gross margin

increased 6
percent in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. Gross margin as a percent of net sales of 34.1
percent decreased 40 basis points compared to fiscal 2018. 

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) 
expenses increased $86
million to $2,936
million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The
increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflects the addition of Blue Buffalo, partially offset by a decrease in media and advertising expense. SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased 70 basis points compared to fiscal
2018. 

Divestitures loss

totaled $30
million in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and
refrigerated dough business in Argentina, and recorded a 
pre-tax
 loss of $35
million. We also sold our yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the
purchaser for their use of the 
Yoplait
 brand. We recorded a 
pre-tax
 gain of $5
million. 

Restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs 
totaled $275
million in fiscal 2019 compared to $166
million in fiscal 2018. 

In fiscal 2019, as a result of lower sales projections in our long range plans for the businesses supporting our 
Progresso
, 
Food Should Taste
Good
, and
 Mountain High 
brand intangible assets, we recorded $193
million of impairment charges related to these brand intangible assets (please see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for
additional information). 
 
In addition, in fiscal 2019, we recorded a $15
million charge related to the impairment of certain manufacturing assets in
our North America Retail and Asia
& Latin America segments. 
 
Charges associated with our restructuring initiatives recognized in fiscal 2019
consisted of the following:

In fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain. In connection with these actions we
recorded $80
million of restructuring charges, consisting of $23
million of severance expense and $57
million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. Four of our operating segments were affected by these actions including
$54
million related to our North America Retail segment, $13
million related to our Asia
& Latin America segment, $12
million related to our Europe
& Australia segment, and $1
million related to our Pet segment.
We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022. 
 
We spent $49
million of cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.

Please see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Interest, net 
for fiscal 2019 totaled $522
million, $148
million higher than fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher debt levels due to
financing for the Blue Buffalo acquisition.

Table of Contents

Our 
effective tax rate 
for fiscal 2019 was 17.7
percent compared to 2.7
percent in fiscal
2018. The 15.0 percentage point increase reflects the lower statutory rate in fiscal 2019 being more than offset by the impact of the 
one-time,
 provisional net benefit of $524
million recorded in fiscal
2018 related to the TCJA. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.8
percent in fiscal 2019 compared to 25.7
percent in fiscal 2018 (see the 
“Non-GAAP
 Measures” section below for a
description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The 3.9 percentage point decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the net benefits associated with the TCJA, partially offset by the change in earnings mix by
jurisdiction. 
 
The TCJA includes provisions affecting our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate, including but not limited to: a reduction in the U.S. corporate
tax rate on domestic operations to 21
percent; a provision that taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations (GILTI); a limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction;
and a limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. In fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7
million which included adjustments to the transition tax and the
measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability. 

After-tax
 earnings from joint ventures 
decreased
$13
million to $72
million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, primarily driven by our $11
million 
after-tax
 share of restructuring charges at CPW, and lower net sales and higher input costs
for HDJ. On a constant-currency basis, 
after-tax
 earnings from joint ventures decreased 14
percent, including the CPW restructuring charge (see the 
“Non-GAAP

Measures” section below for a description of our use of measures not defined by GAAP). The components of our joint ventures’ net sales growth are shown in the following table: 

[TABLE]

Average diluted shares outstanding 
increased by 20
million in fiscal 2019 from fiscal 2018 due to the impact of the fiscal 2018 share issuance to
partially fund the acquisition of Blue Buffalo and option exercises. 

RESULTS OF SEGMENT OPERATIONS 

Our businesses are organized into five operating segments: North America Retail; Convenience Stores
& Foodservice; Europe
& Australia;
Asia
& Latin America; and Pet. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results on a 
one-month
 lag and, accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results.

PET SEGMENT

Our Pet operating segment includes pet food products sold primarily in the United States in national pet superstore chains, 
e-commerce
retailers,
 grocery stores, regional pet store chains, mass merchandisers, and veterinary clinics and hospitals. Our product categories include dog and cat food (dry foods, wet foods, and treats) made
with whole meats, fruits, and vegetables and other high-quality natural ingredients. Our tailored pet product offerings address specific dietary, lifestyle, and life-stage needs and span different product types, diet types, breed sizes for dogs,
lifestages, flavors, product functions and textures, and cuts for wet foods. We are reporting the Pet operating segment results 
on
a
one-month
lag
and
 accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results
did not include Pet segment operating results. 
 
Pet net sales were as follows: 

Pet net sales and segment operating profit in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,431
million and $268
million, respectively. Pet
operating profit includes a $53
million purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired and $13
million of amortization of the customer list intangible asset. 

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS 

Unallocated
corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies,
restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. This includes gains and losses from the

mark-to-market

 valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments in accordance with our policy as discussed in Note 7 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
In fiscal 2019, unallocated corporate expense increased $134
million to
$340
million compared to $206
million last year, primarily driven by compensation and benefits expenses. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $36
million net increase in expense related to 

mark-to-market

 valuation of certain commodity positions and grain inventories compared to a $32
million net decrease in expense in the prior year. In addition, we recorded $10
million of
restructuring charges, and $1
million of restructuring initiative project-related costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2019, compared to $14
million of restructuring charges and $11
million of restructuring initiative project-related
costs in cost of sales in fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2019, we recorded a $16
million gain from a legal recovery related to our Yoplait SAS subsidiary and $23
million of gains related to certain investment valuation adjustments.
We also
recorded $26
million of integration costs in fiscal 2019 related to our acquisition of Blue Buffalo compared to $34
million of transaction and integration costs in fiscal 2018. In addition, we recorded a $3
million loss related to the
impact of hyperinflationary accounting for our Argentina subsidiary in fiscal 2019. 

IMPACT OF INFLATION 

We experienced input cost inflation of 4
percent in fiscal 2019 and 4
percent in fiscal 2018, primarily on commodity inputs. We expect input cost
inflation of approximately 4
percent in fiscal 2020. We attempt to minimize the effects of inflation through HMM, planning, and operating practices. Our risk management practices are discussed in Item 7A of this report.

LIQUIDITY 

The primary source of our liquidity is cash flow from operations. Over the most recent 
two-year
 period, our operations
have generated $5.6
billion in cash. A substantial portion of this operating cash flow has been returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We also use cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures and
acquisitions. We typically use a combination of cash, notes payable, and long-term debt, and occasionally issue shares of stock, to finance significant acquisitions. 

As of May
26, 2019, we had $399
million of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign jurisdictions. As a result of the TCJA, the historic
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were taxed in the U.S. via the 
one-time
 repatriation tax in fiscal 2018.
We have 
re-evaluated
 our assertion and
have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal 2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded
local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all future earnings. As a result of the transition tax, we may
repatriate our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. income tax liability (please see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for additional
information). 

Cash Flows from Operations 

During fiscal 2019, cash provided by operations was $2,807
million compared to $2,841
million in the same period
last year. The $34
million decrease was primarily driven by a $377
million decrease in net earnings and a $550
million change in current assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $598
million change in deferred income taxes.
The $550
million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $413
million change in the timing of accounts payable, including the impact of longer payment terms implemented in prior fiscal years. The change in
deferred income taxes was primarily related to the $638
million provisional benefit from revaluing our net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the TCJA in fiscal 2018. 

We strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2019, core working capital decreased 34
percent,
compared to a net sales increase of 7
percent. As of May
26, 2019, our core working capital balance totaled $385
million, down 34
percent versus last year, this is primarily driven by continued benefits from our payment terms
extension program and lower inventory balances. In fiscal 2018, core working capital decreased 27
percent, compared to a net sales increase of 1
percent.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

In fiscal 2019, we used $556
million of cash through investing activities compared to $8.7
billion in fiscal 2018.
This decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Blue Buffalo for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0
billion, including $103
million of consideration for net debt repaid, in fiscal 2018. We invested $538
million in land,
buildings, and equipment in fiscal 2019, $85
million less than fiscal 2018. 
 
We expect capital expenditures to be approximately 3.5
percent of
reported net sales in fiscal 2020. These expenditures will fund initiatives that are expected to fuel growth, support innovative products, and continue HMM initiatives throughout the supply chain. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

Financing activities used $2.2
billion of cash in fiscal 2019 compared to providing $5.4
billion in fiscal 2018. We
had $1.2
billion of net debt repayments in fiscal 2019 compared to $6.3
billion of net debt issuances in fiscal 2018, which partially funded the acquisition of Blue Buffalo. For more information on our debt issuances and payments, please
refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
During fiscal 2019, we received $241
million of net proceeds from
common stock issued on exercised options compared to $99
million in fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, we received $970
million of net proceeds from common stock issued to fund a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. 

Share repurchases in fiscal 2019 were insignificant. During fiscal 2018, we repurchased 11
million shares of our common stock for $602
million. 

Dividends paid in fiscal 2019 totaled $1,182
million, or $1.96 per share, consistent with fiscal 2018.

Selected Cash Flows from Joint Ventures 

Selected cash flows from our joint ventures are set forth in the following table: 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Total
capital consisted of the following: 

The following table details the 
fee-paid
 committed and uncommitted credit lines we had
available as of May
26, 2019: 

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial
paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. 

Certain of our long-term debt agreements, our credit facilities, and our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May
26, 2019, we
were in compliance with all of these covenants. 
 
We have $1,396
million of long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months that is classified as
current, including $500
million of 2.2
percent notes due October 2019, €300.0 euro-denominated 0.0
percent notes due January 2020, and €500.0
million euro-denominated floating-rate notes due January 2020. We believe
that cash flows from operations, together with available short- and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital needs for at least the next 12 months.

Table of Contents

As of May
26, 2019, our total debt, including the impact of derivative instruments designated as
hedges, was 74
percent in fixed-rate and 26
percent in floating-rate instruments, compared to 73
percent in fixed-rate and 27
percent in floating-rate instruments on May
27, 2018. 

Our net debt to operating cash flow ratio declined to 5.0 in fiscal 2019 from 5.4 in fiscal 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in long-term debt. Our net 

debt-to-adjusted

 earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio declined to 3.9 in fiscal 2019 from 4.2 on a pro forma basis in fiscal 2018,
consistent with our plans to reduce our leverage following our acquisition of Blue Buffalo (see the 
“Non-GAAP
 Measures” section below for our use of this measure not defined by GAAP). 

We have a 51
percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50
percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl.
Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining interests in each of these entities. We consolidate these entities into our consolidated financial statements. We record Sodiaal’s 50
percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and
Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests, and its 49
percent interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These euro- and Canadian dollar-denominated interests are reported in U.S.
dollars on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. As of May
26, 2019, the redemption value of the
redeemable interest was $552
million which approximates its fair value. 
 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Sodiaal invested $56
million
in Yoplait SAS. 
 
The third-party holder of the General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) Class
A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from
available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent

mark-to-market

 valuation (currently $252 million). On June
1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class
A Interests was reset to the sum of
three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class
A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. 

We have an option to purchase the Class
A Interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value, plus any unpaid preferred return
and the prescribed make-whole amount. If we purchase these interests, any change in the third-party holder’s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings
used to calculate EPS in that period. 

OFF-BALANCE
 SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 

As of May
26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $682
million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries,
and guarantees and comfort letters of $134
million for the debt and other obligations of 
non-consolidated
 affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, 
off-balance
 sheet
arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under 
non-cancelable
 operating leases, which totaled $483
million as of May
26, 2019. 

As of May
26, 2019, we invested in four variable interest entities (VIEs). None of our VIEs are material to our results of operations, financial
condition, or liquidity as of and for the fiscal year ended May
26, 2019. 
 
Our defined benefit plans in the United States are subject to the
requirements of the Pension Protection Act (PPA). In the future, the PPA may require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans. We do not expect to be required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020.

Table of Contents

The following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations,
including payments due by period:

(c)

The majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in
the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands. For purposes of this table, arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or
minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure, and approximate timing of the transaction. Most arrangements are cancelable without a significant penalty and with short notice (usually 30 days). Any amounts reflected on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above. 

[/TABLE]
[TABLE]

(d)

The fair value of our foreign exchange, equity, commodity, and grain derivative contracts with a payable
position to the counterparty was $17.3
million as of May
26, 2019, based on fair market values as of that date. Future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the
future. Other long-term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for accrued compensation and benefits, including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans, and
miscellaneous liabilities. We expect to pay approximately $20
million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans and approximately $18
million of deferred compensation in fiscal 2020. We are unable to reliably estimate the
amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2020. As of May
26, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest and penalties was $165.1
million. 

[/TABLE]

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

For a complete
description of our significant accounting policies, please see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our significant accounting estimates are those that have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial
condition and results of operations. These estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension,
other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our revenues are reported net of variable consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and
other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of
sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. Our accrued trade liabilities were $484
million as of May
26, 2019, and $500
million as of
May
27, 2018. Because these amounts are significant, if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments in subsequent periods that could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

Table of Contents

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 

We estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate. 

Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimates of fair value for goodwill impairment
testing are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. We use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market
comparables, and other factors. 
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or
indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known
technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related
groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. Our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a
discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. 

As of May
26, 2019, we had $20.6
billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each
intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of
capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense. We performed our fiscal 2019 assessment of our intangible assets as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2019. As a result of lower sales projections in our
long-range plans for the businesses supporting the 
Progresso
,
 Food Should Taste Good
, and 
Mountain High
 brand intangible assets, we recorded the following impairment charges: 

Significant assumptions used in that assessment included our long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty
rates, weighted-average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. 

34 

Table of Contents

Our Latin America reporting unit and the 
Yoki 
brand intangible asset had fair values that were not
substantially in excess of the carry value. The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2019 test date of the Latin America reporting unit and the 
Yoki
 brand intangible asset were as follows: 

While having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date, the 
Pillsbury
 brand intangible asset and U.S.
Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment. 

Redeemable Interest

In fiscal 2019, we adjusted the redemption value of Sodiaal’s redeemable interest in Yoplait SAS based on a discounted cash flow model. The
significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. As of
May
26, 2019, the redemption value of the redeemable interest was $552
million. 

Stock-based Compensation 

The valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate that requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact
on our financial statements. Annually, we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. For more information on these assumptions, please see Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 
 
The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 

The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury 
zero-coupon
 yield curve in effect at the time of grant. An increase in the expected term by 1 year, leaving all other assumptions constant, would increase the grant date fair value by 9
percent. If all other
assumptions are held constant, a one percentage point increase in our fiscal 2019 volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal 2019 option awards by 8
percent. 

To the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions, we are not required to true up grant-date fair value-based expense to final intrinsic values.
Historical data has a significant bearing on our forward-looking assumptions. Significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions, which could then significantly impact the
year-over-year comparability of stock-based compensation expense. 

35 

Table of Contents

Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously
recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. The actual impact on future years’ cash flows will depend, in part, on the volume of employee
stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise-date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant-date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes. 

Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings. Because employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control, it is possible that significantly different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail. 

Income Taxes 

We apply a 
more-likely-than-not
 threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50
percent likelihood of being
ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the quarter of such change. For more information on income taxes, please see Note 14 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit
Plans 

We have defined benefit pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. We
also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former and inactive employees in the
United States, Canada, and Mexico. Please see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. 

We recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants’ active working lives. Accordingly, we make various
assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations. Assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit
expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long-term rates of return on plan assets, the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans, and health care cost trend rates. 

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers),
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 

Our historical investment returns (compound annual growth rates) for our United States defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets
were 6.6
percent, 6.6
percent, 10.3
percent, 8.4
percent, and 7.9
percent for the 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year periods ended May
26, 2019. 

On a weighted-average basis, the expected rate of return for all defined benefit plans was 7.25
percent for fiscal 2019, 7.88
percent for fiscal
2018, and 8.17
percent for fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2020, we lowered our weighted-average expected rate of return on plan assets for our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the United States to 7.0
percent
due to asset allocation changes and expected asset returns. 
 
Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on assets by 100 basis points would increase
our net pension and postretirement expense by $70
million for fiscal 2020. A market-related valuation basis is used to reduce 

36 

Table of Contents

year-to-year

 expense volatility. The market-related valuation recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a
five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related
value of assets. Our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income. 

Discount Rates 

We estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit
pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.
Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May
31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We work with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount
of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is
applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions. 
 
Our weighted-average discount rates were as follows: 

Lowering the discount rates by 100 basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,
and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal 2020 by approximately $55
million. All obligation-related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan
participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants. 

Health Care Cost Trend Rates 

We review our health care
cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and
projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost
trend rate assumption is 6.7
percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4
percent for retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5
percent is reached in 2029 for
all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’ benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on
the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans.

Any arising health care claims cost-related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future
claims. Once recognized, experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants or over the average remaining lifetime of the remaining plan participants if the
plan is viewed as “all or almost all” inactive participants. 

Financial Statement Impact 

In fiscal 2019, we recorded net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan expense of $24
million compared to
$23
million of expense in fiscal 2018 and $56
million of expense in fiscal 2017. As of May
26, 2019, we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of $2.0
billion on our defined benefit pension plans and cumulative
unrecognized actuarial net gains of $81
million on our postretirement and postemployment benefit plans, mainly as the result of liability increases from lower interest rates, partially offset by recent increases in the values of plan assets.
These unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in increases in our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses because they currently exceed the corridors defined by GAAP. 

Actual future net defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment
performance, changes in future discount rates, changes in health care cost trend rates, and other factors related to the populations participating in these plans. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In August
2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new hedge accounting requirements. The new standard amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements to better align an entity’s risk management activities and
financial reporting. The new standard also simplifies the application of hedge accounting guidance. The requirements of the new standard are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2018, and interim periods within
those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting requirements for accounting, presentation and classification of leases. This will result in certain leases
being capitalized as a right of use asset with a related liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2018,
and interim periods within those annual periods, which for us is the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments allow for either the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires
application of the guidance in all comparative periods presented, or the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires application of the guidance at the adoption date. 

We are in the process of implementing lease accounting software, developing a centralized business process, and implementing corresponding controls. We have
substantially completed our analysis of the impact of this standard on our lease portfolio. We will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the cumulative effect adjustment approach and electing certain practical expedients
permitted under the transition guidance, including not reassessing whether existing contracts contain leases and carrying forward the historical 

38 

Table of Contents

classification of those leases. In addition, we will also elect to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not expect the effects
to the Consolidated Financial Statements to be pervasive. We estimate that we will record right of use assets and related liabilities of approximately $400 to $500
million, subject to the completion of our assessment and the fluctuation of our
lease portfolio and discount rates. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings or our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of
this report for noncancelable future lease commitments. 

NON-GAAP
 MEASURES 

We have included in this report measures of financial performance that are not defined by GAAP. We believe that these measures provide useful information to
investors, and include these measures in other communications to investors. 
 
For each of these 
non-GAAP
 financial
measures, we are providing below a reconciliation of the differences between the 
non-GAAP
 measure and the most directly comparable GAAP measure, an explanation of why we believe the 
non-GAAP
 measure provides useful information to investors, and any additional material purposes for which our management or Board of Directors uses the 
non-GAAP
 measure. These

non-GAAP
 measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, the comparable GAAP measure. 
 
Several
measures below are presented on an adjusted basis. The adjustments are either items resulting from infrequently occurring events or items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the 

year-to-year

 assessment of operating results. 

Organic Net Sales Growth Rates 

We provide organic net sales growth rates for our consolidated net sales and segment net sales. This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors
and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that organic net sales growth rates provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to
underlying performance in our net sales by excluding the effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as acquisitions, divestitures, and a 53
rd
 week, when applicable, have on 

year-to-year

 comparability. A reconciliation of these measures to reported net sales growth rates, the relevant GAAP measures, are included in our Consolidated Results of
Operations and Results of Segment Operations discussions in the MD&A above. 

Net Sales Growth Rate on a Constant-currency Basis 

We believe this measure of net sales provides useful information to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance by excluding the
effect that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on 

year-to-year

 comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. 

Net sales growth rate on a constant-currency basis is calculated as follows:

Adjusted Diluted EPS and Related Constant-currency Growth Rate 

This measure is used in reporting to our Board of Directors and executive management and as a component of the measurement of our performance for incentive
compensation purposes. We believe that this measure provides useful information to investors because it is the profitability measure we use to evaluate earnings performance on a comparable year-to-year basis.

Forward-Looking Financial Measures 

Our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS are

non-GAAP
 financial measures that exclude, or have otherwise been adjusted for, items impacting comparability, including the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, restructuring charges and
project-related costs, acquisition integration costs, and commodity 

mark-to-market

 effects.
Our fiscal 2020 outlook for organic net sales growth also excludes the
effect of a 53rd week, acquisitions, and divestitures.
We are not able to reconcile these forward-looking 
non-GAAP
 financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial
measures without unreasonable efforts because we are unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices or the timing of acquisitions, divestitures and
restructuring actions throughout fiscal 2020.
The unavailable information could have a significant impact on our fiscal 2020 GAAP financial results. 

For fiscal 2020, we currently expect: foreign currency exchange rates (based on a blend of forward and forecasted rates and hedge positions), acquisitions,
divestitures, and a 53rd week to increase net sales growth by approximately 1 to 2 percentage points; foreign currency exchange rates to have an immaterial impact on adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth; and restructuring
charges and project-related costs related to actions previously announced to total approximately $49
million.

Item
7A

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices. Changes in these factors could
cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. In the normal course of business, we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that place clear controls
on these activities. The counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions. We establish credit limits for each counterparty. Our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial
instruments. For information on interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity price, and equity instrument risk, please see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

VALUE AT RISK 

The estimates in the table below are
intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices under normal market conditions. A Monte Carlo 

value-at-risk

 (VAR) methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures. The models assumed normal market conditions and used a 95
percent confidence
level. 
 
The VAR calculation used historical interest and foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the
potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future. The market data were drawn from the RiskMetrics
™
 data set. The calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in
fair value that we expect to incur. Further, since the hedging instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates with the underlying exposure, we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an
increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The positions included in the calculations were: debt; investments; interest rate swaps; foreign exchange forwards; commodity swaps, futures, and options; and equity instruments. The
calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities or equity-related positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
 
General Mills, Inc.:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Mills, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May
26, 2019 and
May
27, 2018, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, total equity and redeemable interest, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May
26, 2019, and the related notes and
financial statement schedule (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May
26, 2019, based on criteria established in 
Internal
Control – Integrated Framework
 
(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
 
In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May
26, 2019 and May
27, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended May
26, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of May
26, 2019 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company’s management is
responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item
9a Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 
 
We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or
fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
 
Our audits of the consolidated financial
statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in 

51 

Table of Contents

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND RECLASSIFICATIONS 

Basis of Presentation 

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of General Mills, Inc. and all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest.
Intercompany transactions and accounts, including any noncontrolling and redeemable interests’ share of those transactions, are eliminated in consolidation. 

Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in May. 
 
Certain
reclassifications to our previously reported financial information have been made to conform to the current period presentation. See Note 2 for additional information. 

Change in Reporting Period 

As part of a long-term
plan to conform the fiscal year ends of all our operations, in fiscal 2017 we changed the reporting period of General Mills Brasil Alimentos Ltda (Yoki) within our Asia
& Latin America segment from an April fiscal 
year-end
 to a May fiscal 
year-end
 to match our fiscal calendar. Accordingly, in fiscal 2017, our results included 13 months of results from the affected operations. The impact
of these changes was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Our General Mills India business and Pet operating segment are on an April fiscal year end. 

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

We consider all
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Inventories 

All inventories in the United States other than grain are valued at the lower of cost, using the 
last-in,
 
first-out
 (LIFO) method, or market. Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with all net changes in value recorded in earnings
currently. 
 
Inventories outside of the United States are generally valued at the lower of cost, using the

first-in,
 
first-out
 (FIFO) method, or net realizable value. 
 
Shipping
costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as cost of sales, and are recognized when the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer. 

Land, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation 

Land
is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance
and repairs are charged to cost of sales. Buildings are usually depreciated over 40 years, and equipment, furniture, and software are usually depreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until
disposal. When an item is sold or retired, the accounts are relieved of its cost and related accumulated depreciation and the resulting gains and losses, if any, are recognized in earnings. As of May
26, 2019, assets held for sale were
insignificant. 
 
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
(or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. Asset groups
have identifiable cash flows and are largely 

58 

Table of Contents

independent of other asset groups. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a
discounted cash flow model or independent appraisals, as appropriate. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have
occurred. We perform our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test as of the first day of the second quarter of the fiscal year. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units. We compare the carrying
value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items
among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, impairment has occurred. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the
total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also
make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. 
 
We evaluate the useful lives of our other
intangible assets, mainly brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required
maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, generally ranging from 4 to 30 years. 

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets, mainly intangible assets primarily associated with the 
Blue Buffalo
,
 Pillsbury
, 
Totino’s
,

Yoplait
, 
Old El Paso
,
 Progresso
,
 Annie’s
, 

Häagen-Dazs

, and
 Yoki
 brands, are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty
rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. 
 
Our finite-lived intangible assets, primarily acquired franchise
agreements and customer relationships, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted
future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Assets generally have identifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other assets. Measurement of an impairment loss would be
based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. Fair value is measured using a discounted cash flow model or other similar valuation model, as appropriate. 

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 

Our
investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence are stated at cost plus our share of undistributed earnings or losses. We receive royalty income from certain joint ventures, incur various expenses (primarily
research and development), and record the tax impact of certain joint venture operations that are structured as partnerships. In addition, we make advances to our joint ventures in the form of loans or capital investments. We also sell certain raw
materials, semi-finished goods, and finished goods to the joint ventures, generally at market prices. 
 
In addition, we assess our investments in our joint
ventures if we have reason to believe an impairment may have occurred including, but not limited to, as a result of ongoing operating losses, projected decreases in earnings, increases in the weighted-average cost of capital, or significant business
disruptions. The significant assumptions 

59 

Table of Contents

used to estimate fair value include revenue growth and profitability, royalty rates, capital spending, depreciation and taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. By their
nature, these projections and assumptions are uncertain. If we were to determine the current fair value of our investment was less than the carrying value of the investment, then we would assess if the shortfall was of a temporary or permanent
nature and write down the investment to its fair value if we concluded the impairment is other than temporary. 

Redeemable Interest 

We have a 51
percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, a consolidated entity. Sodiaal International (Sodiaal) holds the remaining 49
percent
interest in Yoplait SAS. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. This put option requires us to classify Sodiaal’s interest as a
redeemable interest outside of equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for as long as the put is exercisable by Sodiaal. When the put is no longer exercisable, the redeemable interest will be reclassified to noncontrolling interests on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional 
paid-in
 capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value,
which approximates its fair value. During the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019, we adjusted the redeemable interest’s redemption value based on a discounted cash flow model. The significant assumptions used to estimate the redemption
value include projected revenue growth and profitability from our long-range plan, capital spending, depreciation, taxes, foreign currency exchange rates, and a discount rate. 

Revenue Recognition 

Our revenues primarily result
from contracts with customers, which are generally short-term and have a single performance obligation – the delivery of product. We recognize revenue for the sale of packaged foods at the point in time when our performance obligation has been
satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs when the shipment is accepted by our customer. Sales include shipping and handling charges billed to the customer and are reported net of variable
consideration and consideration payable to our customers, including trade promotion, consumer coupon redemption and other costs, including estimated allowances for returns, unsalable product, and prompt pay discounts. Sales, use, value-added, and
other excise taxes are not included in revenue. Trade promotions are recorded using significant judgment of estimated participation and performance levels for offered programs at the time of sale. Differences between estimated expenses and actual
costs are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. We generally do not allow a right of return. However, on a limited 

case-by-case

 basis
with prior approval, we may allow customers to return product. In limited circumstances, product returned in saleable condition is resold to other customers or outlets. Receivables from customers generally do not bear interest. Payment terms and
collection patterns are short-term, and vary around the world and by channel, and as such, we do not have any significant financing components. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable

non-payments
 and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data. Account balances are written off against the allowance when we
deem the amount is uncollectible. Please see Note 16 for a disaggregation of our revenue into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We do not have material
contract assets or liabilities arising from our contracts with customers. 

Environmental Costs 

Environmental costs relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Liabilities
for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or our commitment to a plan of action. 

Advertising Production Costs 

We expense the
production costs of advertising the first time that the advertising takes place.

Research and Development 

All expenditures for research and development (R&D) are charged against earnings in the period incurred. R&D includes expenditures for new product and
manufacturing process innovation, and the annual expenditures are comprised primarily of internal salaries, wages, consulting, and supplies attributable to R&D activities. Other costs include depreciation and maintenance of research facilities,
including assets at facilities that are engaged in pilot plant activities. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the 
period-end
 exchange rates. Income statement accounts are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments are reflected within accumulated other comprehensive loss
(AOCI) in stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings for the period, except for gains and losses on investments in subsidiaries for which settlement is not planned for the foreseeable
future and foreign exchange gains and losses on instruments designated as net investment hedges. These gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. 

Derivative Instruments 

All derivatives are
recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value based on quoted market prices or our estimate of their fair value, and are recorded in either current or noncurrent assets or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values
of derivatives are recorded in net earnings or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is designated and effective as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or losses on derivative instruments
reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified to earnings at that time. Any
ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings in the current period. 

Stock-based Compensation 

We generally measure compensation expense for grants of restricted stock units and performance share units using the value of a share of our stock on the date
of grant. We estimate the value of stock option grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Generally, stock-based compensation is recognized straight line over the vesting period. Our stock-based compensation expense is recorded in selling,
general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and allocated to each reportable segment in our segment results. 

Certain equity-based compensation plans contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and
directors. We consider a stock-based award to be vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service. Accordingly, the related compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for
awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if less than the stated vesting period. 

We report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as an operating cash flow. 

Defined Benefit Pension, Other Postretirement Benefit, and Postemployment Benefit Plans 

We sponsor several domestic and foreign defined benefit plans to provide pension, health care, and other welfare benefits to retired employees. Under certain
circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service.
Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded. 

61 

Table of Contents

We recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability
and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through AOCI. 
 
In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize
the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan
(Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May
31, 2018. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I
(Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide
additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service period of the active participants.
Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over the average remaining life of the participants. Please refer to Note 13 for a description of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement
benefit, and postemployment benefit plans. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets, redeemable interest, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit and
postemployment benefit plans. Actual results could differ from our estimates. 

New Accounting Standards 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements related to the presentation of net periodic defined benefit pension expense, net
periodic postretirement benefit expense, and net periodic postemployment benefit expense (collectively “net periodic benefit expense”). The new standard requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense to be recorded in
the same line items as other employee compensation costs within our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Other components of net periodic benefit expense must be presented separately outside of operating profit in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. In addition, the new standard requires that only the service cost component of net periodic benefit expense is eligible for capitalization. The new standard requires retrospective adoption of the presentation of net periodic benefit
expense and prospective application of the capitalization of the service cost component. The impact of the adoption of this standard on our results of operations was a decrease to our operating profit of $87.9
million, $89.4
million and
$74.3
million and a corresponding increase to benefit plan 
non-service
 income of $87.9
million, $89.4
million and $74.3
million for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.
There were no changes to our reported segment operating profit. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted new accounting requirements for the
recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. Under the new standard, we apply a principles-based five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of promised goods to customers and in an amount that reflects the
consideration for which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The principles-based five step model includes: 1) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; 3)
determining the transaction price; 4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and 5) recognizing revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. We utilized a comprehensive approach to evaluate and
document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices. We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. Additionally, we did not identify any
significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the requirements of the new standard and subsequent amendments to all contracts in the first
quarter of fiscal 2019 using the cumulative effect approach. 

62 

Table of Contents

We recorded a $33.9
million cumulative effect adjustment net of income tax effects to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to deferred income taxes of
$11.4
million, and an increase to other current liabilities of $45.3
million related to the timing of recognition of certain promotional expenditures. 

In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements that codify Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin
No.
118, as it relates to allowing for recognition of provisional amounts related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in the event that the accounting is not complete and a reasonable estimate can be made. Where necessary information is
not available, prepared, or analyzed to determine a reasonable estimate, no provisional amount should be recorded. The guidance allows for a measurement period of up to one year from the enactment date to finalize the accounting related to the TCJA.
In fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. 
 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements
that provide the option to reclassify stranded income tax effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4
million from AOCI to retained earnings.
This reclassification consisted of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceeded the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. The new accounting requirements allowed for adjustments to reclassification amounts in subsequent periods as a
result of changes to the provisional amounts recorded. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new requirements for the accounting and
presentation of stock-based payments. The adoption of this guidance resulted in the prospective recognition of realized windfall and shortfall tax benefits related to the exercise or vesting of stock-based awards in our Consolidated Statements of
Earnings instead of 
additional
paid-in
capital
 within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of realized windfall tax benefits, which
resulted in reclassifications of cash provided by financing activities to operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, we retrospectively adopted the guidance related to reclassification of employee tax
withholdings, which resulted in reclassifications of cash used by operating activities to financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Stock-based compensation expense continues to reflect estimated forfeitures. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we adopted new accounting requirements which permit reporting entities to measure a goodwill impairment loss by the
amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. Previously, goodwill impairment losses were required to be measured by determining the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual goodwill
impairment test was performed as of the first day of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting requirements for the presentation of certain investments using the net asset value, providing a
practical expedient to exclude such investments from categorization within the fair value hierarchy and separate disclosure. We adopted the guidance retrospectively and restated the fiscal 2016 fair value of plan asset tables in Note 13. The
adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations or financial position. 
 
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we adopted new accounting
requirements which permit reporting entities with a fiscal 
year-end
 that does not coincide with a 
month-end
 to apply a practical expedient that permits the entity to
measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the 
month-end
 that is closest to the entity’s fiscal 
year-end
 and apply such practical expedient
consistently to all plans. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. 

NOTE 3.
ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our La Salteña fresh pasta and refrigerated dough business in
Argentina, and recorded a 
pre-tax
 loss of $35.4
million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our 

63 

Table of Contents

yogurt business in China and simultaneously entered into a new Yoplait license agreement with the purchaser for their use of the 
Yoplait
 brand. We recorded a

pre-tax
 gain of $5.4
million. 
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo Pet
Products, Inc. (“Blue Buffalo”) for an aggregate purchase price of $8.0
billion, including $103.0
million of consideration for net debt repaid at the time of the acquisition. In accordance with the definitive agreement and plan
of merger, a subsidiary of General Mills merged into Blue Buffalo, with Blue Buffalo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of General Mills. In accordance with the merger agreement, equity holders of Blue Buffalo received $40.00 per
share in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of $6.0
billion in debt, $1.0
billion in equity, and cash on hand. In fiscal 2019, we recorded acquisition integration costs of $25.6
million in SG&A expenses. In
fiscal 2018, we recorded acquisition transaction and integration costs of $34.0
million in SG&A expenses and $49.9
million in interest, net related to the debt issued to finance the acquisition. 

We consolidated Blue Buffalo into our Consolidated Balance Sheets and recorded goodwill of $5.3
billion, an indefinite-lived intangible asset for the

Blue Buffalo
 brand of $2.7
billion, and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of $269.0
million. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and any intangible assets that did not qualify for separate
recognition. The goodwill is included in the Pet reporting unit and is not deductible for tax purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6
million
increase to goodwill. 
 
The consolidated results of Blue Buffalo are reported as our Pet operating segment on a

one-month
 lag. 
 
The following unaudited supplemental pro forma information is presented as if we had acquired Blue
Buffalo at the beginning of fiscal 2017: 

The fiscal 2017 pro forma amounts include transaction and integration costs of $83.9
million and the purchase accounting
adjustment to record inventory at fair value of $52.7
million. The fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 pro forma amounts include interest expense of $238.7
million on the debt issued to finance the transaction and amortization expense of
$13.5
million based on the estimated fair value and useful life of the customer relationships intangible asset. Additionally, the pro forma amounts include an increase to cost of sales by $1.6
million in fiscal 2017 and $5.1
million
in fiscal 2018 to reflect the impact of using the LIFO method of inventory valuation on Blue Buffalo’s historical operating results. Pro forma amounts include related tax effects of $125.1
million in fiscal 2017 and $14.5
million in
fiscal 2018. Unaudited pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of results had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017 or of future results.

RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES

We view our restructuring activities as actions that help us meet our long-term growth targets. Activities we undertake must meet internal rate of
return and net present value targets. Each restructuring action normally takes one to two years to complete. At completion (or as each major stage is completed in the case of multi-year programs), the project begins to deliver cash savings and/or
reduced depreciation. These activities result in various restructuring costs, including asset write-offs, exit charges including severance, contract termination fees, and decommissioning and other costs. Accelerated depreciation associated with
restructured assets, as used in the context of our disclosures regarding restructuring activity, refers to the increase in depreciation expense caused by shortening the useful life or updating the salvage value of depreciable fixed assets to
coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan. Any impairment of the asset is recognized immediately in the period the plan is approved. 

Charges recorded in fiscal 2019 were as follows:

[/TABLE] 
In fiscal 2019, we approved restructuring actions to drive efficiencies in targeted areas of our global supply chain.
In
our North America Retail segment, we approved actions at certain facilities to consolidate production and optimize our labor and manufacturing platforms. In connection with these actions we will exit our Carson, California yogurt manufacturing
facility.
We expect to incur approximately $101
million of restructuring charges related to these actions, including $10
million of severance expense and $91
million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We also expect to
incur approximately $2
million of project-related costs. We recorded $9.9
million of severance and $44.5
million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we approved targeted systems and process optimization actions in our
Europe
& Australia segment and expect to incur approximately $15
million of restructuring charges, including $11
million of severance expense and $4
million of other costs. We recorded $11.3
million of severance and
$0.7
million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming product lines in our Asia
& Latin America segment and expect to incur approximately $14
million of restructuring charges, including
$1
million of severance expense and $13
million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We recorded $1.0
million of severance and $11.5
million of other costs in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2019, we decided to exit underperforming
markets in our Pet segment and expect to incur approximately $8
million of restructuring charges, including $2
million of severance expense and $6
million of other costs, primarily asset write-offs. We recorded $0.8
million of
severance and $0.5
million of other costs in fiscal 2019. 
 
Certain of these global supply chain actions are subject to union negotiations and works
counsel consultations, where required.
We expect to spend approximately $35
million of cash related to these actions and spent $1.7
million in fiscal 2019.
We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2022. 

In fiscal 2019, we paid $49.3
million in cash related to restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2019.

NOTE 6. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

The components of goodwill and other intangible assets are as follows: 

Based on the carrying value of finite-lived intangible assets as of May
26, 2019, amortization expense for each of the
next five fiscal years is estimated to be approximately $40
million. 
 
In fiscal 2018, we acquired Blue Buffalo, which became our Pet operating
segment and we recorded $5.3
billion of goodwill, $2.7
billion related to an indefinite-lived brand intangible asset, and $269.0
million related to a customer relationships intangible asset. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we
recorded adjustments to certain purchase accounting liabilities that resulted in a $5.6
million increase to goodwill. 
 
The changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 are as follows: 

68 

Table of Contents

The changes in the carrying amount of other intangible assets for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 are as
follows: 

Our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets test was performed on the first day of the second quarter of fiscal
2019. As a result of lower sales projections in our long-range plans for the businesses supporting the 
Progresso
,
 Food Should Taste Good
,
 
and 
Mountain High 
brand intangible assets, we recorded the following impairment
charges: 

In fiscal 2018, we recorded a $96.9
million charge related to the impairment of our 
Yoki
,
 Mountain High
,
and 
Immaculate Baking
 brand intangible assets in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs. 
 
Significant assumptions used in that assessment
included our long-range cash flow projections for the businesses, royalty rates, weighted-average cost of capital rates, and tax rates. 
 
Our Latin America
reporting unit and the 
Yoki 
brand intangible asset had fair values that were not substantially in excess of the carrying values. The excess fair value as of the fiscal 2019 test date of the Latin America reporting unit and the 
Yoki

brand intangible asset were as follows: 

While having significant coverage as of our fiscal 2019 assessment date, the 
Pillsbury
 brand intangible asset and U.S.
Yogurt reporting unit had risk of decreasing coverage. We will continue to monitor these businesses for potential impairment.

NOTE 7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, AND FAIR VALUES 

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, other current liabilities, and notes payable approximate fair value. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. As of May
26, 2019 and May
27, 2018, a comparison of cost and market
values of our marketable debt and equity securities is as follows: 

There were no realized gains or losses from sales of marketable securities in fiscal 2019. In fiscal 2018, we realized
$6.8
million of gains from the sale of 

available-for-sale

 marketable securities. Gains and losses are determined by specific identification. Classification of
marketable securities as current or noncurrent is dependent upon our intended holding period and the security’s maturity date. The aggregate unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

 debt securities, net of tax effects, are classified in AOCI within stockholders’ equity. 

Scheduled maturities of our marketable securities are as follows: 

As of May
26, 2019, we had $2.3
million of certain marketable debt securities pledged as collateral for derivative
contracts. As of May
26, 2019, $34.8
million of certain accounts receivable were pledged as collateral against a foreign uncommitted line of credit. 

The fair value and carrying amounts of long-term debt, including the current portion, were $13,272.8
million and $13,021.3
million, respectively, as
of May
26, 2019. The fair value of long-term debt was estimated using market quotations and discounted cash flows based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. Long-term debt is a Level
2 liability in
the fair value hierarchy. 

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 

As a part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and commodity and equity
prices. To manage these risks, we may enter into various derivative transactions (e.g., futures, options, and swaps) pursuant to our established policies. 

COMMODITY PRICE RISK 

Many commodities we use in the
production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for our principal ingredients and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy
products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Our primary objective when entering into these derivative contracts is to achieve certainty with regard to the future price of 

70 

Table of Contents

commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. We manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders, long-term contracts with suppliers, exchange-traded futures and options, and 

over-the-counter

 options and swaps. We offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our
planned cost as possible. 
 
We use derivatives to manage our exposure to changes in commodity prices. We do not perform the assessments required to achieve
hedge accounting for commodity derivative positions. Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded currently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

Although we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our objective of providing
certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of measuring segment operating performance these gains and losses are reported in unallocated corporate items outside of segment operating
results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings. At that time we reclassify the gain or loss from unallocated corporate items to segment operating profit, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of
the derivative without experiencing any resulting 

mark-to-market

 volatility, which remains in unallocated corporate items. 

Unallocated corporate items for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 included: 

As of May
26, 2019, the net notional value of commodity derivatives was $312.5
million, of which $242.9
million
related to agricultural inputs and $69.6
million related to energy inputs. These contracts relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next 12 months. 

INTEREST RATE RISK 

We are exposed to interest rate
volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt, and existing and future issuances of floating-rate debt. Primary exposures include U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR, Euribor, and commercial paper rates in the United States and Europe. We use
interest rate swaps, forward-starting interest rate swaps, and treasury locks to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs, and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed rate versus floating-rate
debt, based on current and projected market conditions. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Floating Interest Rate Exposures — 

Floating-to-fixed

 interest rate
swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges, as are all hedges of forecasted issuances of debt. Effectiveness is assessed based on either the perfectly effective hypothetical derivative method or changes in the present value of interest payments on
the underlying debt. Effective gains and losses deferred to AOCI are reclassified into earnings over the life of the associated debt. Ineffective gains and losses are recorded as net interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than
$1
million in fiscal 2019, a $2.6
million loss in fiscal 2018, and less than $1
million in fiscal 2017. 
 
Fixed Interest Rate Exposures
— 

Fixed-to-floating

 interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges with effectiveness assessed based on changes in the fair value of the underlying debt
and derivatives, using 

71 

Table of Contents

incremental borrowing rates currently available on loans with similar terms and maturities. Ineffective gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying hedged items are recorded as net
interest. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was a $2.4
million gain in fiscal 2019, a $3.4
million loss in fiscal 2018, and a $4.3
million gain in fiscal 2017. 

In advance of planned debt financing related to the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, we entered into $3,800.0

Average floating rates are based on rates as of the end of the reporting period. 

The swap contracts outstanding as of May

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK 

Foreign currency fluctuations
affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases, intercompany loans, product shipments, and foreign-denominated debt. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency
earnings to the U.S. dollar. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, 

72 

Table of Contents

Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures. We also generally swap our foreign-denominated
commercial paper borrowings and nonfunctional currency intercompany loans back to U.S. dollars or the functional currency of the entity with foreign exchange exposure. The gains or losses on these derivatives offset the foreign currency revaluation
gains or losses recorded in earnings on the associated borrowings. We generally do not hedge more than 18 months in advance. 
 
As of May
26, 2019, the
net notional value of foreign exchange derivatives was $1,008.5
million. The amount of hedge ineffectiveness was less than $1
million in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017. 

We also have net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros. We previously hedged a portion of these net investments by issuing
euro-denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts. As of May
26, 2019, we hedged a portion of these net investments with €2,200.0
million of euro denominated bonds. As of May
26, 2019, we had deferred net
foreign currency transaction losses of $51.5
million in AOCI associated with net investment hedging activity. 

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS 

Equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments made by our employees in our deferred compensation plan are revalued. We use
equity swaps to manage this risk. As of May
26, 2019, the net notional amount of our equity swaps was $169.1
million. These swap contracts mature in fiscal 2020.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an investment grade credit rating on our debt from each of the
major credit rating agencies. If our debt were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of
all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position on May
26, 2019, was $7.4
million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts. If the credit-risk-related contingent features
underlying these agreements had been triggered on May
26, 2019, we would have been required to post $7.4
million of collateral to counterparties. 

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK 

During fiscal 2019, customer concentration was as follows: 

[TABLE]

(a)

Includes Walmart Inc. and its affiliates. 

[/TABLE]

No customer other than Walmart accounted for 10
percent or more of our consolidated net sales. 

We enter into interest rate, foreign exchange, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, primarily with a diversified group of highly rated
counterparties. We continually monitor our positions and the credit ratings of the counterparties involved and, by policy, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one party. These transactions may expose us to potential losses due to the risk of
nonperformance by these counterparties; however, we have not incurred a material loss. We also enter into commodity futures transactions through various regulated exchanges. 

The amount of loss due to the credit risk of the counterparties, should the counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of the contracts, is
$2.4
million against which we do not hold collateral. Under the terms of our swap agreements, some of our transactions require collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to threshold levels of exposure and
counterparty credit risk. Collateral assets are either cash or U.S. Treasury instruments and are held in a trust account that we may access if the counterparty defaults. 

78 

Table of Contents

We offer certain suppliers access to third party services that allow them to view our scheduled payments
online. The third party services also allow suppliers to finance advances on our scheduled payments at the sole discretion of the supplier and the third party. We have no economic interest in these financing arrangements and no direct relationship
with the suppliers, the third parties, or any financial institutions concerning this service. All of our accounts payable remain as obligations to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements. As of May
26, 2019, $1,049.8
million of
our accounts payable is payable to suppliers who utilize these third party services. 

NOTE 8. DEBT 

NOTES PAYABLE 

The components of notes payable and their
respective weighted-average interest rates at the end of the periods were as follows: 

To ensure availability of funds, we maintain bank credit lines sufficient to cover our outstanding notes payable. Commercial
paper is a continuing source of short-term financing. We have commercial paper programs available to us in the United States and Europe. We also have uncommitted and asset-backed credit lines that support our foreign operations. 

The following table details the 
fee-paid
 committed and uncommitted credit lines we had available as of May
26,
2019: 

The credit facilities contain covenants, including a requirement to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 2.5
times. We were in compliance with all credit facility covenants as of May
26, 2019. 

LONG-TERM DEBT 

In March 2019, we issued €300.0
million principal amount of 0.0
percent fixed-rate notes due January
15, 2020. We may redeem the notes if
certain tax laws change and we would be obligated to pay additional amounts on the notes. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. We used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to
repay our €300.0
million floating rate notes. 
 
In February 2019, we repaid $1,150.0
million of 5.65
percent fixed-rate notes with
proceeds from commercial paper. 

79 

Table of Contents

In April 2018, we issued $4,800.0
million principal amount of fixed-rate notes. Interest on the notes
is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds
were used to finance a portion of the Blue Buffalo acquisition. The principal amounts of these fixed-rate notes were as follows: 

In April 2018, we issued $1,250.0
million principal amount of floating-rate notes. Interest on the notes is payable
quarterly in arrears. The notes are not generally redeemable prior to maturity. These notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Blue Buffalo
acquisition. The principal amounts of these floating-rate notes were as follows: 

In February 2018, we paid $113.8
million to repurchase $100.0
million of our previously issued 6.39
percent
medium term notes due 2023. We recorded the $13.8
million premium paid in the repurchase as net interest expense. 
 
In October 2017, we issued
$500.0
million principal amount of 2.6
percent fixed-rate notes due October
12, 2022. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears. We may redeem the notes in whole, or in part, at any time at the applicable redemption
price. The notes are senior unsecured obligations that include a change of control repurchase provision. The net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to repay $500.0
million of 1.4

 loss. 

NOTE 9. REDEEMABLE AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 

Our principal redeemable and noncontrolling interests relate to our Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, Liberté Marques Sàrl, and General Mills
Cereals, LLC (GMC) subsidiaries. In addition, we have 4 foreign subsidiaries that have noncontrolling interests totaling $4.9
million as of May
26, 2019. 

We have a 51
percent controlling interest in Yoplait SAS and a 50
percent interest in Yoplait Marques SNC and Liberté Marques Sàrl.
Sodiaal holds the remaining interests in each of the entities. On the acquisition date, we recorded the $904.4
million fair value of Sodiaal’s 49
percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait SAS as a redeemable interest on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Sodiaal has the ability to put all or a portion of its redeemable interest to us at fair value once per year, up to three times before December 2024. We adjust the value of the redeemable interest through additional 
paid-in
 capital on our Consolidated Balance Sheets quarterly to the redeemable interest’s redemption value, which approximates its fair value. Yoplait SAS pays dividends annually if it meets certain financial
metrics set forth in its shareholders’ agreement. As of May
26, 2019, the redemption value of the euro-denominated redeemable interest was $551.7
million. 

On the acquisition dates, we recorded the $281.4
million fair value of Sodiaal’s 50
percent euro-denominated interest in Yoplait Marques SNC
and 50
percent Canadian dollar-denominated interest in Liberté Marques Sàrl as noncontrolling interests on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Yoplait Marques SNC earns a royalty stream through a licensing agreement with Yoplait SAS
for the rights to

Yoplait

and related trademarks. Liberté Marques Sàrl earns a royalty stream through licensing agreements with certain Yoplait group companies for the rights to

Liberté

and
related trademarks. These entities pay dividends annually based on their available cash as of their fiscal year end. 
 
We paid dividends of
$22.0
million in fiscal 2019 and $37.7
million in fiscal 2018 to Sodiaal under the terms of the Yoplait SAS, Yoplait Marques SNC, and Liberté Marques Sàrl shareholder agreements. 

A subsidiary of Yoplait SAS has entered into an exclusive milk supply agreement for its European operations with Sodiaal at market-determined prices through
July
1, 2021. Net purchases totaled $210.8
million for fiscal 2019 and $230.8
million for fiscal 2018. 
 
During the second quarter of fiscal
2019, Sodiaal invested $55.7
million in Yoplait SAS. 
 
The holder of the GMC Class
A Interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from
available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate to the holder’s capital account balance established in the most recent

mark-to-market

 valuation (currently $251.5 million).
On June
1, 2018, the floating preferred return rate on GMC’s Class
A interests was reset to the
sum of three-month LIBOR plus 142.5 basis points. The preferred return rate is adjusted every three years through a negotiated agreement with the Class
A Interest holder or through a remarketing auction. 

For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities, results of operations, and cash flows of our 
non-wholly

owned consolidated subsidiaries are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The third-party investor’s share of the net earnings of these subsidiaries is reflected in net earnings attributable to redeemable and noncontrolling
interests in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 
 
Our noncontrolling interests contain restrictive covenants. As of May
26, 2019, we were in
compliance with all of these covenants.

million from AOCI to retained earnings. Please see Note 14 for additional information.

NOTE 11. STOCK PLANS 

We use broad-based stock plans
to help ensure that management’s interests are aligned with those of our shareholders. As of May
26, 2019, a total of 30.3
million shares were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
and shares of unrestricted stock under the 2017 Stock Compensation Plan (2017 Plan). The 2017 Plan also provides for the issuance of cash-settled share-based units, stock appreciation rights, and performance-based stock awards. Stock-based awards
now outstanding include some granted under the 2007, 2009, and 2011 stock plans and the 2006 and 2011 compensation plans for 
non-employee
 directors, under which no further awards may be granted. The stock
plans provide for potential accelerated vesting of awards upon retirement, termination, or death of eligible employees and directors. 

Stock Options

The estimated fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were as follows: 

We estimate the fair value of each option on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires us to
make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility, employee exercise behavior, dividend yield, and the forfeiture rate. We estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the
option, excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility. We also have considered, but did not use, implied volatility in our estimate, because trading activity in
options on our stock, especially those with tenors of greater than 6 months, is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility. 

85 

Table of Contents

Our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on
historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes. The
weighted-average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above. The risk-free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury 
zero-coupon

yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
 
Any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously
recognized in earnings (referred to as a windfall tax benefit) is presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating cash flow. Realized windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax deficiencies related to the exercise or vesting of
stock-based awards are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. We recognized windfall tax benefits from stock-based payments in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings of $24.5
million in fiscal 2019 and
$25.5
million in fiscal 2018. 
 
Options may be priced at 100
percent or more of the fair market value on the date of grant, and generally vest
four years after the date of grant. Options generally expire within 10 years and one month after the date of grant. 
 
Information on stock option activity
follows: 

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option awards was $14.7
million in fiscal 2019, $15.5
million in
fiscal 2018, and $18.0
million in fiscal 2017. Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs for fiscal
2018 and 2017. 
 
Net cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options less shares used for minimum withholding taxes and the intrinsic value of options
exercised were as follows: 

Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Share Units 

Stock and units settled in stock subject to a restricted period and a purchase price, if any (as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors), may be granted to key employees under the 2017 Plan. Restricted stock and restricted stock units generally vest and become unrestricted four years after the date of grant. Performance share units are earned primarily based on our future
achievement of three-year goals for average organic net sales growth and cumulative free cash flow. Performance share units are settled in common stock and are generally subject to a three year performance and vesting period. The sale or transfer of
these 

86 

Table of Contents

awards is restricted during the vesting period. Participants holding restricted stock, but not restricted stock units or performance share units, are entitled to vote on matters submitted to
holders of common stock for a vote. These awards accumulate dividends from the date of grant, but participants only receive payment if the awards vest. 

Information on restricted stock unit and performance share unit activity follows: 

The total grant-date fair value of restricted stock unit awards that vested was $47.1
million in fiscal 2019 and
$93.0
million in fiscal 2018. 
 
As of May
26, 2019, unrecognized compensation expense related to

non-vested
 stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units was $98.4
million. This expense will be recognized over 21 months, on average. 

Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units and performance share units was $70.2
million for fiscal 2019, $62.4
million for
fiscal 2018, and $77.9
million for fiscal 2017. Compensation expense related to stock-based payments recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings includes amounts recognized in restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs for fiscal
2019, 2018, and 2017.

NOTE 13. RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans 

We have defined benefit
pension plans covering many employees in the United States, Canada, Switzerland, France, and the United Kingdom. Benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation. Benefits for hourly employees include
various monthly amounts for each year of credited service. Our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. We made no voluntary contributions to our principal U.S. plans in fiscal 2019 or 2018. We do not expect to be
required to make any contributions in fiscal 2020. Our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would be allocated to active participants if the plan is terminated within five
years of a change in control. All salaried employees hired on or after June
1, 2013, are eligible for a retirement program that does not include a defined benefit pension plan. 

In fiscal 2018, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and the supplemental pension plans that resulted in
the spinoff of a portion of the General Mills Pension Plan (the Plan) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan (Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans) into new plans effective May
31, 2018. The
benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of the General Mills Pension Plan I (Plan I) and the 2005 Supplemental Retirement Plan I and the Supplemental Retirement Plan I
(Grandfathered) (together, the Supplemental Plans I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains
and losses associated with the Plan and the Supplemental Plans are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants. Actuarial gains and losses associated with the Plan I and the Supplemental Plans I are amortized over
the average remaining life of the participants. 

88 

Table of Contents

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans 

We also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to many of our retirees in the United States, Canada, and Brazil. The United States salaried health
care benefit plan is contributory, with retiree contributions based on years of service. We make decisions to fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis. We made no voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal 2019
or fiscal 2018. 

Health Care Cost Trend Rates 

Assumed health care cost trends are as follows: 

We review our health care cost trend rates annually. Our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims
experience and information provided by our actuaries. This information includes recent plan experience, plan design, overall industry experience and projections, and assumptions used by other similar organizations. Our initial health care cost trend
rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review, recent experiences, and short-term expectations. Our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is 6.7
percent for retirees age 65 and over and 6.4
percent for
retirees under age 65 at the end of fiscal 2019. Rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of 4.5
percent is reached in 2029 for all retirees. The trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees’
benefits increase as a result of health care inflation. The ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually, as necessary, to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long-term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium. Assumed
trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans. 
 
A one percentage point

Postemployment Benefit Plans 

Under certain circumstances, we also provide accruable benefits, primarily severance, to former or inactive employees in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.
We recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service. Postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service (such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service) are charged to
expense when incurred. Our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded.

[/TABLE]

Discount Rates 

We estimate the service and interest cost
components of the net periodic benefit expense for our United States and most of our international defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans utilizing a full yield curve approach by applying the specific
spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of May
31 for our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit,
and postemployment benefit plan obligations. We also use discount rates as of May
31 to determine defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year. We work
with our outside actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and, using the Aa Above Median corporate bond yield, to develop a forward interest rate curve, including a margin to that index based
on our credit risk. This forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions.

Table of Contents

There were no material changes in our level 3 investments in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018. 

Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

Our expected rate
of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation, our historical long-term investment performance, our estimate of future long-term returns by asset class (using input from our actuaries, investment services, and investment managers),
and long-term inflation assumptions. We review this assumption annually for each plan; however, our annual investment performance for one particular year does not, by itself, significantly influence our evaluation. 

Weighted-average asset allocations for the past two fiscal years for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows: 

The investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit
obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us. Our goal is to optimize the long-term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk. The defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan portfolios are broadly
diversified across asset classes. Within asset classes, the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations. For the U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the long-term investment policy allocation is:
18
percent to equities in the United States; 11
percent to international equities; 9
percent to private equities; 48
percent to fixed income; and 14
percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and infrastructure). For other
U.S. postretirement benefit plans, the long-term investment policy allocations are: 18
percent to equities in the United States; 10
percent to international equities; 4
percent to private equities; 65
percent to fixed income; and
3
percent to real assets (real estate, energy, and timber). The actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long-term policy allocations based on relative market valuations.

Contributions and Future Benefit Payments 

We do not expect to be required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit plans in fiscal
2020. Actual fiscal 2020 contributions could exceed our current projections, as influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts and future changes in regulatory requirements. Estimated benefit payments, which
reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid from fiscal 2020 to 2029 as follows: 

Defined Contribution Plans 

The General Mills Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that covers domestic salaried, hourly, nonunion, and certain union employees. This plan is a
401(k) savings plan that includes a number of investment funds, including a Company stock fund and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). We sponsor another money purchase plan for certain domestic hourly employees with net assets of
$22.3
million as of May
26, 2019, and $23.9
million as of May
27, 2018. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in many of our foreign locations. Our total recognized expense related to defined contribution plans was
$52.7
million in fiscal 2019, $49.2
million in fiscal 2018, and $54.1
million in fiscal 2017. 
 
We match a percentage of employee
contributions to the General Mills Savings Plan. The Company match is directed to investment options of the participant’s choosing. The number of shares of our common stock allocated to participants in the ESOP was 5.1
million as of
May
26, 2019, and 5.6
million as of May
27, 2018. The ESOP’s only assets are our common stock and temporary cash balances. 
 
The
Company stock fund and the ESOP collectively held $410.1

million of Company common stock as of May
26, 2019 and May
27, 2018, respectively.

 earnings from joint ventures and the corresponding income
taxes thereon are as follows: 

The following table reconciles the United States statutory income tax rate with our effective income tax rate:

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are as
follows: 

We have established a valuation allowance against certain of the categories of deferred tax assets described above as current
evidence does not suggest we will realize sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (e.g., ordinary income versus capital gain income) within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. 

Information about our valuation allowance follows: 

As of May
26, 2019, we believe it is 
more-likely-than-not
 that the remainder of
our deferred tax assets are realizable. 

97 

Table of Contents

Information about our tax loss carryforwards follows: 

Our foreign loss carryforwards expire as follows: 

On December
22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA results in significant revisions to the U.S. corporate
income tax system, including a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, implementation of a territorial system, and 
a
one-time
deemed
 repatriation tax on untaxed foreign earnings. As a result
of the TCJA, we recorded a provisional benefit of $523.5
million during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2019, we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA and recorded a benefit of $7.2
million which included adjustments to the
transition tax and the measurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJA is deemed to be complete, these amounts were based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and
any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. 
 
The legislation also
includes provisions that affected our fiscal 2019 results, including but not limited to, a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate on domestic operations; the creation of a new minimum tax called the base erosion anti-abuse tax; a new provision
that taxes U.S. allocated expenses as well as currently taxes certain income from foreign operations (Global Intangible Low Tax Income or GILTI); a new limitation on deductible interest expense; the repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction;
and limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. 
 
While the new legislation generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on
dividends from foreign subsidiaries going forward, certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries must be included currently in our U.S. taxable income under the new GILTI inclusion rules.
Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting
policy election and record the taxes as a period cost as incurred or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes.
In fiscal 2018, we made an accounting policy election to record these taxes as a period cost. 

As of May
26, 2019, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of approximately $2.3
billion from our foreign
operations because we currently believe our subsidiaries have invested the undistributed earnings indefinitely, or the earnings will be remitted in a 
tax-neutral
 transaction. It is not practicable for us to
determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested earnings. Deferred taxes are recorded for earnings of our foreign operations when we determine that such earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, we

re-evaluated
 our assertion and have concluded that although earnings prior to fiscal 2018 will remain permanently reinvested, we will no longer make a permanent reinvestment assertion beginning with our fiscal
2018 earnings. As part of the accounting for the TCJA, we recorded local country withholding taxes related to certain entities from which we began repatriating undistributed earnings and will continue to record local country withholding taxes on all
future earnings. 
 
In addition, in fiscal 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 
2018-02:
 
Income Statement
– Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)
 (ASU 
2018-02),
 which provides the option to reclassify stranded income tax 

98 

Table of Contents

effects resulting from the TCJA from AOCI to retained earnings. We elected to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of the TCJA of $329.4
million from AOCI to retained earnings. This
reclassification consists of deferred taxes originally recorded in AOCI that exceed the newly enacted federal corporate tax rate. 
 
We are subject to
federal income taxes in the United States as well as various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final
outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our liabilities for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. We adjust these liabilities, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts
and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash. 
 
The number of years with open tax audits varies depending
on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions include the United States (federal and state) and Canada. Various tax examinations by United States state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year, which vary by
jurisdiction, but are generally from 3 to 5 years. 
 
Several state and foreign examinations are currently in progress. We do not expect these examinations
to result in a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. During fiscal 2018, we recorded an adjustment related to a prior year which increased income tax expense by $40.9
million.
We determined the adjustment to
be immaterial to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended May
27, 2018.
We have effectively settled all issues with the IRS for fiscal years 2015 and prior. 

During fiscal 2017, the Brazilian tax authority, Secretaria da Receita Federal do Brasil (RFB), concluded audits of our 2012 and 2013 tax return years. These
audits included a review of our determinations of amortization of certain goodwill arising from the acquisition of Yoki Alimentos S.A. The RFB has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate the goodwill amortization benefits related to this
transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to contest the disallowance. 
 
We apply a

more-likely-than-not
 threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions. Accordingly, we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50
percent likelihood of being
ultimately realized upon settlement. Future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect earnings in the period of such change. 

The following table sets forth changes in our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, excluding accrued interest, for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018.
Approximately $81.2
million of this total in fiscal 2019 represents the amount that, if recognized, would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods. This amount differs from the gross unrecognized tax benefits presented in the
table because certain of the liabilities below would impact deferred taxes if recognized. We also would record a decrease in U.S. federal income taxes upon recognition of the state tax benefits included therein. 

99 

Table of Contents

As of May
26, 2019, we expect to pay approximately $2.0
million of unrecognized tax benefit
liabilities and accrued interest within the next 12 months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. The remaining amount of our unrecognized
tax liability was classified in other liabilities. 
 
We report accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities in income tax
expense. For fiscal 2019, we recognized $0.5
million of 
tax-related
 net interest and penalties, and had $26.0
million of accrued interest and penalties as of May
26, 2019. For fiscal 2018, we
recognized a net benefit of $3.1
million of 
tax-related
 net interest and penalties, and had $27.3
million of accrued interest and penalties as of May
27, 2018. 

NOTE 15. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND CONTINGENCIES 

Our leases are generally for warehouse space and equipment. Rent expense under all operating leases from continuing operations was $184.9
million in
fiscal 2019, $189.4
million in fiscal 2018, and $188.1
million in fiscal 2017. 
 
Some operating leases require payment of property taxes,
insurance, and maintenance costs in addition to the rent payments. Contingent and escalation rent in excess of minimum rent payments and sublease income netted in rent expense were insignificant. 

Noncancelable future lease commitments are: 

Depreciation on capital leases is recorded as depreciation expense in our results of operations. 

As of May
26, 2019, we have issued guarantees and comfort letters of $681.6
million for the debt and other obligations of consolidated subsidiaries,
and guarantees and comfort letters of $133.9
million for the debt and other obligations of 
non-consolidated
 affiliates, mainly CPW. In addition, 
off-balance
 sheet
arrangements are generally limited to the future payments under 
non-cancelable
 operating leases, which totaled $482.6
million as of May
26, 2019.

one-month
lag
and
 accordingly, our fiscal 2018 results did not include Pet segment operating results. 

Operating profit for these segments excludes unallocated corporate items, gain or loss on divestitures, and restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs.
Unallocated corporate items include corporate overhead expenses, variances to planned domestic employee benefits and incentives, contributions to the General Mills Foundation, asset and liability remeasurement impact of hyperinflationary economies,
restructuring initiative project-related costs, and other items that are not part of our measurement of segment operating performance. These include gains and losses arising from the revaluation of certain grain inventories and gains and losses from

mark-to-market

 valuation of certain commodity positions until passed back to our operating segments. These items affecting operating profit are centrally managed at the
corporate level and are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by executive management. Under our supply chain organization, our manufacturing, warehouse, and distribution activities are substantially integrated across our
operations in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, fixed assets and depreciation and amortization expenses are neither maintained nor available by operating segment.

Fair value hierarchy. 
For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on
the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level
1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level
3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:

Level
1:

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level
2:

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level
1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.

Level
3:
