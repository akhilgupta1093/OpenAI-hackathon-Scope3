When used in this Annual Report on Form

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations and conditions in the general economy and markets in which we compete, our forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form
10-K are also subject to the risk and uncertainty that:

•

the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to the efficacy of the vaccine rollout, the closure of non-essential businesses, which may include our manufacturing facilities, and other associated governmental containment actions, may vary from our current expectations, and the increase in cyber-security attacks that have occurred while non-production employees work remotely;

•

the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs due to wildfires may vary from our current expectations due to, among other reasons, the actual severity and geographical reach of wildfires;

Table of Contents

•

the actual balance of supply and demand for our products and percentage of our portfolio distributed through any particular distributor will vary from current expectations due to, among other reasons, actual raw material supply, actual shipments to distributors, and actual consumer demand;

•

the actual demand, net sales, and volume trends for our products will vary from current expectations due to, among other reasons, actual shipments to distributors, and actual consumer demand;

•

the amount, timing, and source of funds for any share repurchases or Canopy warrant exercises, if any, may vary due to market conditions; our cash and debt position; the impact of the beer operations expansion activities; the impact of our investment in Canopy; any future exercise of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants; the expected impacts of the Wine and Spirits Divestitures; and other factors as determined by management from time to time;

•

the amount and timing of future dividends may differ from our current expectations if our ability to use cash flow to fund dividends is affected by unanticipated increases in total net debt, we are unable to generate cash flow at anticipated levels, or we fail to generate expected earnings;

•

the fair value of our investment in Canopy may vary due to market and economic conditions in Canopy’s markets and business locations;

•

the accuracy of management’s projections relating to the Canopy investment may vary from management’s current expectations due to Canopy’s actual results of operations and market and economic conditions;

•

the timeframe and actual costs associated with the beer operations expansion activities and amount of impairment for non-recoverable brewery expansion assets in Mexico may vary from management’s current expectations due to market conditions, our cash and debt position, receipt of required regulatory approvals by the expected dates and on the expected terms, results of discussions with government officials in Mexico, actual amount of non-recoverable brewery expansion assets, and other factors as determined by management;

•

the actual restructuring charge, if any, associated with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures will vary based on management’s final plans;

•

the amount of contingent consideration if any, received in the Wine and Spirits Divestitures will depend on actual future brand performance;

•

any impact of U.S. federal laws on the transaction between Acreage and Canopy or upon the implementation of that transaction or the impact of the Acreage Transaction upon our future ownership level in Canopy or our future share of Canopy’s reported earnings and losses, may vary from management’s current expectations; and

•

our targeted leverage ratio may vary from management’s current expectations due to market conditions, our ability to generate cash flow at expected levels, and our ability to generate expected earnings.

Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by our forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form

Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, and SVEDKA Vodka. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are the third-largest beer company and a leader in the high-end of the U.S. beer market and a higher-end wine and spirits company with many of our products as leaders in their respective categories. Our strong market positions make us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.

Our mission is to build brands that people love. We are in the business of creating new experiences that bring people together and elevate their lives. It’s worth our dedication, hard work, and the bold calculated risks we take to deliver more for our employees, consumers, trade partners, shareholders, and communities in which we live and work. It’s what has made us one of the fastest-growing large CPG companies in the U.S. at retail, and it drives our pursuit to deliver what’s next. Our key values are:

People

 – True strength is achieved when everyone has a voice. That is why we build our culture on a foundation that encourages inclusion and diversity of thought, where everyone feels empowered to bring their true selves and different points of views to drive us forward;

Customers

 – We are relentless to anticipate what consumers want today, tomorrow, and well into the future;

Entrepreneurship

 – As an industry leader, we act with a bold calculated approach to realize our vision and unlock new growth opportunities;

Quality

 – Our promise is to pursue quality in our process and products by continuously enhancing what we do and how we do it; and

Integrity

 – It is about more than achieving goals. How we achieve them is just as important. We act with high moral and ethical standards and always do the right thing, even when it is the hard thing.

Headquartered in Victor, New York, we are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.

Strategy

Our overall strategy is to drive growth and shape the future of our industry by building brands that people love and delivering unrivaled value to our shareholders. We endeavor to position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led premiumization trend, which we believe will continue to drive faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine, and spirits categories.

To capitalize on consumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with a focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry. Key elements of our strategy include:

•

leverage our leading position in total beverage alcohol and scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio;

•

strengthen relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;

•

invest in brand building and innovation activities;

•

position ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;

•

realize operating efficiencies by expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

•

develop employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.

We have remained committed to executing this strategy, and as a result have realized its impact on each segment of our business.

In our beer business, we have solidified our position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market; enhanced our margins, results of operations, and operating cash flow; and provided new avenues for growth. We made capital investments to increase beer production capacity to support the growth of the business. We continue to focus on consumer-led innovation by creating new products that meet emerging needs.

In our wine and spirits business, we continue to focus on higher-end brands, improve margins, and create operating efficiencies. We continue to drive our strategy by acquiring higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands, including the addition of Meiomi and Prisoner to the portfolio we refined over the past several years. We have strategically optimized the value of this business through the recent divestitures of a portion of our wine and spirits business, which included lower-margin, lower-growth brands, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities. Higher-end spirits brands were added to our spirits portfolio through the acquisitions of Casa Noble tequila, and High West craft whiskeys, and we recently introduced SVEDKA and High West pre-mixed cocktails to capitalize on the growth in the ready-to-drink space. In addition, we have strengthened our position in the accelerating direct-to-consumer and 3-tier eCommerce channel with the acquisition of Empathy Wines and investment in Booker Vineyard.

We complement our strategy with our investment in Canopy by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. Canopy is a leading cannabis company with operations in countries across the world. This investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. We expanded our strategic relationship with Canopy to help position it as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.

For further information on our strategy, see MD&A.

Notes 2 and 10.

Business segments

We have four reportable segments: (i)
Beer, (ii)
Wine and Spirits, (iii)
Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv)
Canopy. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, resources are allocated, operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Our ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. 

Amounts included below for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy’s reported results 

on a two-month lag, 

prepared in accordance with

 U.S.
GAAP

, and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of the Canopy results are included in the information below and subsequently eliminated to reconcile to our consolidated 

financial statements

. 

We report net sales in two reportable segments, as Canopy is eliminated in consolidation, as follows:

Beer segment

We are the #1 brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market. We are also the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported, craft, and ABA categories. We have the exclusive right to import, market, and sell the following Mexican brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:

Other Import Brands

Corona Extra

Corona Light

Modelo Especial

Pacifico

Corona Premier

Corona Refresca

Modelo Negra

Victoria

Corona Familiar

Corona Hard Seltzer

Modelo Chelada

[/TABLE]

In the U.S., we are the leading imported beer company and have nine of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands. Modelo Especial is the best-selling imported beer, third best-selling beer overall, and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand in the U.S. Corona Extra is the second largest imported beer and sixth best-selling beer overall in the U.S.

In the past eight years we have more than tripled our production capacity in Mexico allowing us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. In Fiscal 2021, we strengthened our competitive position in the fast-growing hard seltzer category, broadened our distribution reach, and enhanced our market share in the high-end. After our successful launch of Corona Refresca in Fiscal 2020, we launched Corona Hard Seltzer in early Fiscal 2021. With only one SKU, Corona Hard Seltzer reached the #4 best-selling seltzer brand family, and allowed us to capitalize on the robust growth of the high-end ABA category. In early Fiscal 2022, we expanded into new flavors and introduced
a second Corona Hard Seltzer variety pack and expect to launch
Corona Hard Seltzer Limonada in June of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing sales distribution of products in can, draft, single-serve, and larger package size formats.

Expansion efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Projects. Since the 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested nearly $5
billion in the Mexico Beer Projects, with approximately $700
million during Fiscal
2021. In early Fiscal 2022, we completed part of a planned expansion project at the Obregon Brewery, increasing our production capacity to approximately 39 million hectoliters and contributing to our medium-term capacity needs.

Wine and Spirits segment

We are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S. and New Zealand, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. Our wine and spirits are primarily marketed in the U.S. and exported to Canada and other major world markets.

In the U.S., we have eight of the 100 top-selling high-end wine brands, with Meiomi and Kim Crawford achieving the #4 and #7 spot, respectively. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands and portfolio of brands include:

We have been increasing our investment in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth. We have launched varietal line extensions behind many of our brands, such as The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, Woodbridge spirits barrel aged varietals, Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, and SVEDKA and High West pre-mixed cocktails in the ready-to-drink space.

Corporate Operations and Other segment

The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function.

Canopy segment

The Canopy Equity Method Investment

 makes up the Canopy segment.

For further information regarding net sales and operating income (loss) of our business segments and geographic areas see Note

Marketing and distribution

To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity, and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales, and customer service functions. These functions engage in a range of 

[TABLE]

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions, and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.

In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, which generally have separate distribution networks for (i)
our beer portfolio and (ii)
our wine and spirits portfolio. In addition, in states where the government acts as the distributor, we distribute our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies, which set the retail prices of our products. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state. State governments can also affect prices paid by consumers for our products through the imposition of taxes.

Effective April
1, 2021, approximately 70% of our branded wine and spirits portfolio volume in the U.S. is expected to be distributed through an expanded relationship with a single distributor.

Trademarks and distribution agreements

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. We also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products, and products of others. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.

Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual.

Competition

The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence, and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include:

[TABLE]

Beer

Anheuser-Busch InBev, Molson Coors, Heineken, The Boston Beer Company, Mark Anthony

Wine

E. & J. Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero Family Estates, Deutsch
Family Wine & Spirits, Treasury Wine Estates, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates 

Spirits

Diageo, Sazerac Company, Beam Suntory, Pernod Ricard, Bacardi USA, Brown-Forman, Fifth Generation

[/TABLE]

Canopy operates in the recreational and medicinal cannabis markets and, in their largest market, they compete with numerous licensed producers and distributors of cannabis products. In the recreational market, Canopy competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, consistency and variety of cannabis products whereas these same competitive factors apply in the medical market as well as physician familiarity.

Production

As of February
28, 2021, our production capacity at our Mexican breweries was approximately 34 million hectoliters. By the end of Fiscal 2025, we expect to complete planned expansions to increase our capacity in Mexico to approximately 54 million hectoliters to support the growth of our Mexican brands, including ABAs. During this time, we will also explore options to build an additional plant at another location in Southeastern Mexico where there is ample access to water and a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs.

We are continuing to work with government officials in Mexico to determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project. For further information on these expansion and construction efforts, refer to (i)
MD&A and (ii)
Notes 5 and 23.

Our Daleville facility, located in Roanoke, Virginia, supports our craft and specialty business in addition to our domestic innovation initiatives.

In the U.S., we operate 11 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey, and San Joaquin regions of California. We also operate two wineries in New Zealand and six wineries in Italy. Grapes are crushed in September through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest and are reduced as sold throughout the year.

We currently operate four distilleries in the U.S. for the production of our spirits; two facilities for High West whiskey, one facility for Copper & Kings American brandies, and one facility for Nelson’s Green Brier bourbon and whiskey products. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.

Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.

Resources and availability of production materials

The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum, and cardboard.

For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.

For Fiscal 2021, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was as follows:

The Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries’ on-going requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion activities. Both breweries also take advantage of onsite wastewater treatment operations to reuse water consumed as part of the production process.

As part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, one of the leading manufacturers of glass containers in the world. The joint venture owns a state-of-the-art glass production plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico. The glass plant currently has five operational glass furnaces which supply approximately 55% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands. We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.

The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials, primarily glass.

Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by grower purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 180 independent growers in the U.S. and 55
independent growers located in New Zealand and Italy. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.

[TABLE]

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

[/TABLE]

As of February
28, 2021, we owned or leased approximately 18,200 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.

We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.

The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits, and bulk spirits, which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.

We utilize glass and PET bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags, and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.

Government regulations

We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising, and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership, or control.

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

As part of our brewery expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we plan to continue working with local authorities and community-based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. For example, over the past several years we helped support local infrastructure investments in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico that have enhanced water efficiency in the region. This is in addition to other benefits we provide, including local job creation and fueling economic development. We are working with local authorities in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico on similar initiatives.

Seasonality

The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.

[TABLE]

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

For Fiscal 2021, our beer net sales were higher in the second and third quarters as inventory levels in our distribution channels were replenished following a COVID-19 related production slowdown at our major breweries in Mexico earlier in the year.

Human capital resources

As of March
31, 2021, we had approximately 9,300 employees, including approximately 1,200 employees through our equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The number of employees may change throughout the year, as we employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons. Approximately 20% of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year are minimal. We consider our employee relations generally to be good.

Employee geographic data is as follows:

COVID-19 response

We have an existing Crisis Management Committee that since January 2020 has been closely monitoring the impact of the virus that causes COVID-19, on our business and our workforce. In March 2020, the WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In response, we have implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, implementing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO. We believe these prevention measures have been effective as evidenced by the minimal number of COVID-19 cases within our workforce. Additionally, we added a Chief Medical Officer to provide health-related advice and expertise to our executive officers, Crisis Management Committee, and human resources leadership teams as they make decisions to protect the health and safety of our workforce.

We value the contributions of our workforce and considered the impacts the pandemic would have on their well-being. For our production workforce, we paid “premium pay” for a period of time while such employees continued to work on-site. In addition, where employees were not able to work due to temporary facility closures, we protected their pay to ensure they had a continued paycheck. For our hospitality employees, we recognized a material portion of their pay comes from customer gratuities and we paid these employees an equivalent value during our pay protection period. Our non-production workforce is able to work remotely using various technology tools. As part of the remote office approach, we provided reimbursement for home office support ensuring our employees had the resources needed to be effective. We have implemented a formal COVID-19 policy and launched various programs to assist our employees, including engaging with third-party wellness providers to host dedicated sessions on mental and physical well-being, and increased flexibility and resources surrounding personal and family commitments. We continue to implement and evolve our comprehensive plan to return to our non-production facilities, with government recommendations and our workforce safety guiding how we manage our return to facilities.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Our DE&I strategic priorities are as follows (i)
develop a best-in-class, diverse workforce that reflects the consumers and communities we serve – close representation gaps to achieving our diversity goals; (ii)
develop an inclusive culture – create more equitable experience for underrepresented groups; harness the benefits of diversity; and (iii)
enhance social equity – extend our influence within the beverage alcohol industry and communities we serve.

We provide opportunities for our employees to advance our DE&I strategic priorities through a growing community of BRGs. Our BRGs are supported at the highest level with sponsorships from our executives. See “Executive Officers of the Company” below. Each BRG is tasked with making a business impact on behalf of the 

[TABLE]

[/TABLE]

represented group and welcome allies. In Fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of our U.S. salaried employees were members of one or more BRGs.

Monitoring human capital metrics is a critical component to ensuring we are executing on our strategy and making progress against our DE&I objectives and goals. We measure gender and racial representation to understand diversity at various levels across the organization, and assess progress over time and to drive continuous improvement. We also assess metrics throughout the human resource lifecycle to identify potential bias and barriers in our processes, including talent acquisition, turnover, engagement scores, or participation in BRG events. 

Compensation and benefits

We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that meet the needs of our employees. There are four components of compensation: (i)
base pay, (ii)
long-term incentives dependent on a number of factors such as geographic location and management level which include restricted stock units, stock options, and performance share units, (iii)
short-term incentives, and (iv)
recognition awards. Base compensation is reviewed on an annual basis ensuring it is competitive in the market and gives employees opportunities to earn more for exceeding expectations. Our total rewards program also offers valuable benefits, tools, and resources designed to help employees stay healthy and well, while achieving security, growth, satisfaction, and success.

Professional development

We are committed to empowering our employees to grow their careers. In Fiscal 2021, we spent approximately $16
million in development and training costs, which enables our people to keep reaching for what’s next — personally and professionally.

Employee engagement

We assess employee engagement through targeted pulse surveys, which provide feedback on a variety of topics, such as company direction and strategy, DE&I, individual development, collaboration, and trust. During calendar year 2020, we had an average response rate of 78% to our surveys and an average engagement measurement of 81% across our surveyed population.

Safety

We are committed to ensuring the safety of our employees. Our global EHS policy defines our dedication to providing a safe and healthy working environment and developing a culture where every employee takes responsibility for their own safety as well as the safety of others while minimizing our impact on the environment in the communities where we live and work. With a focus on continuous improvement we are developing more robust EHS management systems, strengthening employee awareness and training, and ensuring senior leadership engagement on safety. Work-related injuries resulting from the production of our beer, wine, and spirits products are well below industry average. Our recordable incident rate as compared to the industry average are as follows:

(1)

Defined as total number of worldwide Constellation work-related injuries (cases beyond first aid) per 100 full-time employees.

(2)

Calculated by taking the weighted average of the most recent (2019) U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data for wineries, breweries, and distilleries based on our portfolio mix on February 2021 and February 2020 for the years ended February 28, 2021, and February 29, 2020, respectively.

Empowering our employees to give back

Giving back to our communities is a value instilled by our founder, Marvin Sands, and remains core to our company’s DNA. We empower our employees to engage in the communities where they live and work in a variety of ways, including volunteering time and through a charitable matching program available to all U.S. employees.

We match donations ranging from a maximum of $5,000 to $50,000 per year, depending on management level, to charitable organizations.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, as well as additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations in present and/or future periods.

Operational Risks

Supply of quality water, agricultural, and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles

The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, wineries, and distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations. The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields. If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints. In addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as corn, barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.

We have substantial brewery operations in the country of Mexico, brewery operations in the states of Texas, Virginia, and Florida, and we currently have substantial wine operations in the state of California as well. In the past, California had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage, and a recurrence of such conditions could have an adverse effect upon those operations. Our Mexico brewery operations currently receive allocations of water sufficient for their operations. The water supply for our Nava Brewery is sourced from a single water supply. Although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future. We may incur additional expenses for improving water delivery and securing additional water sources.

Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries, and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products. These include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast, and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries. Our breweries, wineries, and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard, and other paper products. Our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel in their operations. Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities. The supply, on-time availability and price of raw materials, packaging materials, and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts, storms, and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases, and theft.

Our breweries, wineries, and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles. Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands. In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer operations.

Disruptions in our supply chains could impact our ability to continue production. To the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

Reliance upon complex information systems and third-party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design and ongoing implementation of our new global ERP

We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports. We recognize that many groups on a worldwide basis have experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware. As with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties’ intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers, or consumers. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.

We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis, but we do not ultimately control their performance. Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract, or a cyber-attack on them that disrupts their systems, could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations or a penetration of our systems.

We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system. We previously replaced the portion of our ERP system servicing our Mexican operations and on March 1, 2021, we replaced the portion of our ERP system servicing our wine and spirits operations, U.S. beer operations, and our corporate operations. The ERP system for the remaining portions of our business is scheduled to be replaced later in Fiscal 2022. We are designing the ERP system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. We expect our ongoing implementation process will continue to require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. Companies which implement new ERP systems may experience delays, increased costs, and other difficulties. If our ERP system design and implementation plan is not successful or if our ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, or we may not be able to operate our business.

To the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Economic and political uncertainties associated with our international operations

Our products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries, and we have production facilities currently in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy.

The countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts. Governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other government rules and regulations including but not limited to environmental treaties and regulations. Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Any such tariffs, particularly on imports from Mexico and any retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Mexican government, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including our sales and profitability.

In addition, governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements, or taxes could have a material 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.

These uncertainties and changes, as well as the decisions, policies, and economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Dependence on limited facilities for production of our Mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issues

We are dependent on our Nava and Obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our Mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near-term.

We are expanding our Nava and Obregon breweries. In a public consultation process in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, voters voiced opposition to the construction of our Mexicali Brewery, and we have suspended construction of that brewery. We are currently working with local authorities, Mexican government officials, and members of the community in Mexicali on next steps related to that brewery construction project and options elsewhere in Mexico for our long-term production requirements. These are multi-million-dollar activities, with a potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns. 

Expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)
our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)
potential changes in federal, state, and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)
inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; (iv)
inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel; or (v)
a temporary halt in construction activities due to COVID-19. Any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities.

We may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction, or total destruction of the Nava or Obregon breweries or the glass plant, or difficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the U.S., or temporary inability to produce our product due to closure or lower production levels of one or more of our Mexican breweries as a result of COVID-19. Also, if the contemplated expansions of the Nava and Obregon breweries and construction of additional brewery capacity in Mexico are abandoned or are not otherwise completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our Mexican beer to satisfy our needs. Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our Mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all. A significant disruption at our Nava or Obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our product supply, business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities, or distribution systems

All of our Mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico. Many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the Mexican government is also evaluating labor reform proposals which could increase our costs. The glass plant currently has five operational glass furnaces which supply approximately 55% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands. Several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain California wineries, are in areas prone to seismic activity. Additionally, we 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

have various vineyards and wineries in the state of California which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.

If any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments, and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Also, our production facilities are asset intensive. As our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, severe winter storms, hurricanes, pandemics, labor strike, or other labor activities, cyber-attacks, and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems or the information technology used by our employees who work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made events. If a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending, or product supply constraints.

Our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes and may not cover certain events such as pandemics. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance. If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Pandemics, such as the current global COVID-19 virus, outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health concerns in the markets in which our consumers or employees live and/or in which we or our distributors, retailers, and suppliers operate

Disease outbreaks and other public health conditions could result in disruptions and damage to our business caused by potential negative consumer purchasing behavior as well as disruption to our supply chains, production processes, and operations. Consumer purchasing behavior may be impacted by reduced consumption by consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner as a result of quarantines or other cancellations of public events and other opportunities to purchase our products, from bar and restaurant closures, or from a reduction in consumer discretionary income due to reduced or limited work and layoffs. Supply disruption may result from restrictions on the ability of employees and others in the supply chain to travel and work, such as caused by quarantine or individual illness, or which may result from border closures imposed by governments to deter the spread of communicable infection or disease, or determinations by us or our suppliers or distributors to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, or other actions which restrict the ability to distribute our products or which may otherwise negatively impact our ability to produce, bottle and ship our product, for our distributors to distribute our products, or for our suppliers to provide us our raw materials. Ports or channels of entry may be closed or operate at only a portion of capacity, or transportation of product within a region or country may be limited, if workers are unable to report to work due to travel restrictions or personal illness. Our operations and the operations of our suppliers may become less efficient or otherwise become negatively impacted if our executive leaders or other personnel critical to our operations are unable to work or if a significant percentage of the workforce is unable to work or is required to work from home. Our cyber-security could be compromised if persons who are forced to work from home do not maintain adequate information security. A prolonged quarantine or border closure could result in temporary or longer-term disruptions of sales patterns, consumption and trade patterns, supply chains, production processes, and operations. A widespread health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in a global economic downturn which could negatively impact demand for our products and our ability to borrow money. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Climate change and environmental regulatory compliance

Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in California or an unexpected severe winter 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

storm in Texas or Mexico, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials or the energy supply powering our production facilities. Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. Natural disasters such as severe storms, floods, and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products.

We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements. In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability, and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. We may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, or fires. We cannot assure that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers, and government agencies

Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products with generally separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio. In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies. We have an exclusive arrangement with one wholesaler that will generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits net sales. Wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers, or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests, and the effects of weather and climate conditions

Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect sales. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts, and certain other weather conditions or the effects of climate conditions, such as smoke taint from wildfires, could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes, and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products. Similarly, power disruptions due to weather conditions could adversely impact our production processes and the quality of our products. We cannot guarantee that we and/or our suppliers of agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing and/or future vineyards or fields. Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops. It is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.

Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials, or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials, or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine, or spirits products, or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.

If any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs. A widespread product 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.

Marijuana is currently illegal under U.S. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control Canopy’s business or operations

The ability of Canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, Canopy’s compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and Canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products. The laws and regulations governing medical and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. Canopy’s success will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to operate successfully in the cannabis market space and the presence of sufficient retail outlets. There are also concerns about health issues associated with certain types of form factors for cannabis products, such as those used in vaping. These issues may result in a less robust consumer demand for certain form factors. There is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any Canopy products. Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the U.S. and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law. Even in those U.S. states in which the recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of U.S. federal law. Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana would likely limit the expansion of Canopy’s business into the U.S. Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact negatively Canopy’s markets, products, and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment in Canopy.

We have the right to nominate four members of the Canopy board of directors. While we do not control Canopy’s business or operations, we do rely on Canopy’s internal controls and procedures for operation of that business. Nevertheless, our financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i)
Canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with Canadian laws in all material respects; (ii)
Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import, and/or sell marijuana, or any other controlled substance in or from the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation, or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules and regulations; and (iii)
Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the U.S. or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, sale, manufacture, or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, local, or foreign laws, rules and regulations. Were we to know that Canopy was knowingly or intentionally violating any of these applicable laws, we would be unable to make the required certification under our financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements.

Strategic Risks

Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our Mexican beer brands

Our business depends upon consumers’ consumption of our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and sales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business. Accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount, or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics, or perceived value. Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our beer, wine, and spirits brands, and our Mexican beer brands in particular, or from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies may be put into effect to deal with the spread of COVID-19, and changes in leisure, dining, and beverage consumption 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

patterns. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:

•

a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;

•

concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;

•

a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, which may result from stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;

•

the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;

•

increased federal, state, provincial, and foreign excise, or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;

•

increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;

•

inflation; and

•

wars, health epidemics or pandemics, quarantines, weather, and natural or man-made disasters.

Acquisition, divestiture, investment, and NPD strategies

From time to time, we acquire businesses, assets, or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business. We integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations, and information systems. If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations. We may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business. In addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities, or other potential synergies. We cannot assure that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.

We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets, or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets. Divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. Delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives.

We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery, our interest in Canopy, and investments made through our corporate ventures capital function, and have acquired control of companies which we do not wholly own, such as our 75% interest in Nelson’s Green Brier. Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies. Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests. The entities in which we have an interest may be subject to litigation which may have an adverse impact on their ability to do business or under which they may incur costs and expenses which could have a material adverse impact on their operations or financial condition which, in turn, could negatively impact the value of our investment. The internal control over financial reporting of entities which we consolidate but either do not control or do not wholly own, may not be as robust as our internal controls.

We previously increased our investment in Canopy through exercise of our warrants in Canopy and we may further increase our investment in the future. While we will not develop, distribute, manufacture, or sell cannabis products in the U.S., or anywhere else in the world, unless legally permissible to do so at all 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

[/TABLE]

governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.

In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products such as our Corona Hard Seltzer. The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal. A new product launch can give rise to a variety of costs. An unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands, and our reputation. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.

We cannot assure that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, or investments. We also cannot assure that our acquisitions, investments, or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, or investment activities will be accurate or that the internal control over financial reporting of entities which we must consolidate as a result of our investment activities will be as robust as the internal control over financial reporting for our wholly-owned entities. Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Our Canopy investment is dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis products

The legal cannabis market is an emerging market. The legislative framework pertaining to the Canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in other countries, is uncertain. The success of the Canopy transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to create a strong platform to operate successfully in the cannabis market space, consumer demand for its products, and the presence of sufficient retail outlets. There are also concerns about health issues associated with certain types of form factors for cannabis products, such as those used in vaping. These issues may result in a less robust consumer demand for certain form factors. There is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any Canopy products.

The changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.

For example, the Canadian 

Cannabis Act

 prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding and packaging that is appealing to youth. The restrictions on advertising, marketing, and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, and our investment in Canopy.

Additionally, Canopy must rely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts may not be fully available at this early stage in the cannabis industry in Canada and globally. Market research relating to the adult-use recreational legal cannabis industry is in its early stages and, as such, trends can only be forecasted.

A failure in the demand for Canopy’s products to materialize as a result of competition, consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.

Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights

Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly developed brands and products. We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications. We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate, or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued

to, or licensed by, us. On February
15, 2021, Cervecería Modelo de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against our subsidiaries CB Brand Strategies, LLC, Crown, and Compañía Cervecera de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V., alleging, among other things, that our sublicense of the trademarks for our Mexican beer brands should not permit us to use the Corona brand name on our Corona Hard Seltzer. While we believe this lawsuit is without merit, if we are not successful, we may not be able to market our hard seltzer product in its current formulation under the Corona brand name which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Financial Risks

Indebtedness

We have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities, pay cash dividends, and repurchase shares of our common stock. In the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, pay cash dividends, repurchase shares of our stock, and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities. We cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements; return value to shareholders such as through payment of dividends or repurchase of shares of our common stock; and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.

Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences. These consequences include, or may include, the following:

•

our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or investments/acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;

•

our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends, or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;

•

our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and

•

our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.

Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper. Certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. In addition, certain of our current and future debt and derivative financial instruments have, or in the future, could have interest rates that are tied to reference rates, such as LIBOR or SOFR. The volatility and availability of such reference rates, including establishment of alternative reference rates, is out of our control. Changes to or the unavailability of such rates or the manner for calculation of such reference rates, could result in increases to the cost of our debt.

If we do not comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements. In such an event, the holders of our debt could elect to declare as due and payable all amounts outstanding under those instruments. A default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If that occurred, we might not have available funds to satisfy our repayment obligations.

Securities measured at fair value

The value of the warrants and convertible debt we hold in Canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock. This volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility. The market price of Canopy’s common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of Canopy, or of us. These factors include, but are not limited to:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in Canopy’s reported results of operations;

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

•

recommendations by securities analysts;

•

impact of COVID-19 on Canopy’s operations and revenues, on Canopy’s ability to access financial markets, and on the cannabis industry generally;

•

changes in the market valuations of companies in the industry in which Canopy operates;

•

announcement of developments and material events by Canopy or its competitors;

•

fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services;

•

addition or departure of Canopy executive officers or other key personnel;

•

news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological, or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in Canopy’s industry or target markets;

•

regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and Canopy’s business and operations; and

•

administrative obligations associated with Health Canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the Canadian 

Cannabis Act

.

Our financial statements are subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock. We currently account for our shares in Canopy under the equity method. We recognize our equity in Canopy’s earnings on a two-month lag primarily because of the availability of Canopy’s financial results since Canopy’s fiscal year ends annually March 31 while our fiscal year ends annually on the last day of February.

Canopy’s corporate governance and valuation

Canopy’s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both Canopy’s compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance. These include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, Nasdaq, and previously the NYSE. These rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for Canopy. Canopy was previously exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements because it was a foreign private issuer. As of September 30, 2019, it no longer met the test to qualify as a foreign private issuer. Effective April 1, 2020, Canopy was required to comply with all the NYSE corporate governance requirements and the requirements of SOX that require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of Canopy’s internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. In November 2020, Canopy delisted from the NYSE and transferred its listing to Nasdaq. Canopy is required to comply with applicable Nasdaq listing standards. In the future, Canopy’s internal controls may not be adequate, or Canopy may not be able to maintain adequate and effective internal controls over financial reporting as required by SOX, or on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented, or amended from time to time. If not maintained, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm Canopy’s business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of Canopy securities. Our investment in Canopy could be impaired if the trading price of its equity is below our carrying value of that investment.

In addition, we record as equity in earnings our proportional share of Canopy’s results. We could have a material weakness in the event the proportional share of Canopy’s results that we record contains an error as a result of an error in Canopy’s financial statements that we do not detect.

Although we do not control Canopy, we do have significant influence over Canopy. If we controlled Canopy, we would have to consolidate Canopy into our financial statements, and if Canopy had a material weakness, we would inherit Canopy’s material weakness through consolidation. In such an event, even if Canopy’s financial statements were correct, the fact that Canopy had a material weakness could result in a material weakness for us.

Class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practices

There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. We could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Other Risks

Control by the Sands family

Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family. Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights. The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April
14, 2021, voting as a single class. Consequently, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class. In addition, if significant stock indices decide to prohibit the inclusion of companies with dual class structures, the price of our Class A Common Stock could be negatively impacted and could become more volatile.

General Risks

International operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulations

Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, include:

•

changes in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions;

•

potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;

•

restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

•

import and export requirements and border accessibility;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights, privacy obligations, real property rights, and liability issues; and

•

inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown and the disruption, volatility, and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts, or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products. These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues, and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers, and consumers. The inability of suppliers, distributors, and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.

We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. We could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.

We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes or animus against the U.S. Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.

Damage to our reputation

The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid, such as the similarity of the name of 

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

certain of our brands or trademarks and a type of virus), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:

•

a perceived failure to maintain high ethical and ESG standards and practices for all our operations and activities;

•

a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety, or integrity of our products, including from contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action;

•

allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, corporate citizenship, improper business practices, or cyber-security;

•

our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or

•

efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.

Failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity and renew investor confidence.

Competition

We are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:

•

our inability to maintain or increase prices;

•

new entrants in our market or categories;

•

the decision of wholesalers, retailers, or consumers to purchase competitors’ products instead of ours; or

•

a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.

Sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising, or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general, and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.

Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks

We have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future. Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards. The write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions, and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections, or assertions

The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers, or consumers. Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years. Federal, state, provincial, local, or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.

[TABLE]

PART I

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

In addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions. Our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions. Fluctuations in federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results. When tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.

U.S. tax changes or changes in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties, and may affect the price of our common stock

Our capital allocation strategy contemplates cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program. We fund our cash dividends and share repurchases through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings, and divestiture proceeds. However, we are not required to declare dividends or to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. We may discontinue, accelerate, suspend, or delay our dividends and share repurchases at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing, and frequency of such dividends and share repurchases may vary from historical practice or from our stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase, or delay our cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the natures and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to our ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, and the availability of cash. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or longer suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market prices of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

We have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” located in our Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended February
29, 2020, filed on April
21, 2020, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended February
28, 2019, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented. This MD&A, which should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, is organized as follows:

Overview.

This section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition, and potential future trends.

Strategy

.

This section provides a description of our strategy and a discussion of recent developments, significant investments, acquisitions, and divestitures.

Results of operations.

This section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis. In addition, a brief description of significant transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided.

Liquidity and capital resources.

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows, outstanding debt, liquidity position, and commitments. Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the capacity available to fund our ongoing operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.

Critical accounting policies and estimates.

This section identifies accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates. Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1.

Overview

Our internal management financial reporting consists of three business divisions:
(i)
Beer, (ii)
Wine and Spirits, and (iii)
Canopy and we report our operating results in four segments:
(i)
Beer, (ii)
Wine and Spirits, (iii)
Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv)
Canopy. Our 

Canopy Equity Method Investment

 makes up the Canopy segment.

In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer, craft beer, and ABA brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, 

our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands 

complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, 

as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function

. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. 

The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

ITEM 7. MD&A

Strategy

Our business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. This includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as NPD and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion and construction activities for our Mexico beer operations. Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we have leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends.

We have

more than tripled the production capacity of the Nava Brewery since its 2013 acquisition. In early Fiscal 2022, we completed part of a planned expansion of our Obregon Brewery. Expansion efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Projects to align with our anticipated future growth expectations. However, at this time, we have suspended all Mexicali Brewery construction activities, following a negative result from a public consultation held in Mexico. See “Capital expenditures” below.

Our strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands. We are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers, including launching direct-to-consumer and eCommerce platforms; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise, and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands. We focus our innovation and investment dollars on brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization. Additionally, in connection with the recent divestitures, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins. In markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our U.S. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth. This consolidated U.S. distribution network currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the U.S. Effective April 1, 2021, we have modified our U.S. wine and spirits distribution network to a single distributor which we expect to continue to represent approximately 70% of that volume. Throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors’ shipments to retailers.

Marketing, sales, and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis allowing us to leverage leading market positions. In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets. Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, ABA, branded wine, and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)

our beer portfolio and (ii)

our wine and spirits portfolio. The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.

We complement our strategy with our investment in Canopy, by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. Canopy is a leading cannabis company with operations in countries across the world. This investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. We expanded our strategic relationship with Canopy to help position it as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property, and retailing.

We remain committed to our long-term financial model of: growing sales, expanding margins, and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio, and deliver returns to shareholders through the payment of dividends and periodic share repurchases. Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. In the event of future rising costs, we intend to pass along such rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices. In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.

Recent Development

Mexicali Brewery

In April 2021, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell or abandon the Mexicali Brewery. Subsequently, management determined that we will be unable to use or repurpose certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect to recognize a long-lived asset impairment of approximately $650 million to $680 million which will be included within our consolidated results of operations. The fair value will be determined based on the expected salvage value of the abandoned assets as of April 2021. We are continuing to work with government officials in Mexico to (i)
determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project and (ii)
pursue various forms of recovery for capitalized costs and additional expenses incurred in establishing the brewery, however, there can be no assurance of any recoveries. In the medium-term, under normal operating conditions, we have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer needs based on current growth forecasts and current and planned production capabilities. To align with our anticipated future growth expectations we are also working with the Mexican government to explore options to add further capacity at another location in Southeastern Mexico where there is ample water and a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs.

COVID-19

In the key markets where we sell our products, the beverage alcohol industry has been classified as an essential business. COVID-19 containment measures affected us earlier in the fiscal year primarily in the reduction of (i)
depletion volume on our products in the on-premise business due to bar and restaurant closures and (ii)
shipment volume related to the reduced production activity at our major breweries in Mexico. The on-premise business has historically been about 10% to 15% of our depletion volume for beer, wine, and spirits. The Fiscal 2021 decrease in the on-premise business has been more than offset by an increase in off-premise. We expect our on-premise depletion volumes to return to more normal levels as Federal Drug Administration approved COVID-19 vaccines are administered across the U.S. and states begin the process of fully reopening their economies, including bars and restaurants.

Currently, our breweries, wineries, and bottling facilities are open and operational. However, certain facilities may experience occasional temporary closures due to applicable local conditions. In June
2020, beer production at our major breweries in Mexico returned to normal levels following a slow down earlier in the fiscal year.

Our supply chains and distribution channels were not materially impacted and we worked throughout the fiscal year to rebuild our supply of products to meet forecasted demand. Distributor product inventories returned to normal levels at the end of Fiscal 2021.

In response to COVID-19, we have ensured our ongoing liquidity and financial flexibility through cash preservation initiatives, capital expense reductions, and cost control measures. We are not able to estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flow. We believe we have sufficient liquidity available from operating cash flow, cash on hand, and availability under our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We expect to have continued access to capital markets and to be able to continue to return value to shareholders through dividends and periodic share repurchases.

Investments, acquisitions, and divestitures

Beer segment

Ballast Point Divestiture

In March
2020, we sold the Ballast Point craft beer business, including a number of its associated production facilities and brewpubs. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our Ballast Point craft beer business through the date of divestiture.

Wine and Spirits segment

Paul Masson Divestiture

In January
2021, we sold the Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy brand, related inventory, and interests in certain contracts. We received cash proceeds of $267.4 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. The 

[TABLE]

[/TABLE]

net cash proceeds were used for general corporate purposes. For the year ended February 28, 2021, we recognized a net gain of $58.9 million on the sale of the business.

Wine and Spirits Divestitures

In January
2021, we sold a portion of our wine and spirits business, including lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, related inventory, interests in certain contracts, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities. We received net cash proceeds of $538.4 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition, we have the potential to earn an incremental $250
million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance targets are met over a two-year period after closing.

In January
2021, we also sold the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets. We received cash proceeds of $129.0 million, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.

The cash proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures were utilized to repay the 3.75% May 2013 Senior Notes and for other general corporate purposes. For the year ended February 28, 2021, we recognized a net loss of $35.7 million on the Wine and Spirits Divestitures.

Concentrate Business Divestiture

In December
2020, we sold certain brands used in our concentrates and high-color concentrate business, and certain intellectual property, inventory, goodwill, interests in certain contracts, and assets of our concentrates and high-color concentrate business.

The following presents selected financial information included in our historical consolidated financial statements that are no longer part of our consolidated results of operations following the Paul Masson Divestiture, Wine and Spirits Divestitures, and Concentrate Business Divestiture:

Included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations.

Copper & Kings acquisition

In September
2020, we acquired the remaining ownership interest in Copper & Kings which primarily included the acquisition of inventories, and property, plant, and equipment. This acquisition included a collection of traditional and craft batch-distilled American brandies and other select spirits. The results of operations of Copper & Kings are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Empathy Wines acquisition

In June
2020, we acquired Empathy Wines, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, and inventory. This acquisition, which included a digitally-native wine brand, strengthened our position in the direct-to-consumer and eCommerce markets. The results of operations of Empathy Wines are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Booker Vineyard investment

In April
2020, we invested in Booker Vineyard, a super-luxury, direct-to-consumer focused wine business that is accounted for under the equity method. We recognize our share of their equity in earnings (losses) in our consolidated financial statements in the Wine and Spirits segment.

Black Velvet Divestiture

In November
2019, we sold the Black Velvet Canadian Whisky business and the brand’s associated production facility, along with a subset of Canadian whisky brands produced at that facility, and related inventory. Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our Canadian whisky business through the date of divestiture. We received cash proceeds of $266.7
million, net of post-closing adjustments. We recognized a net gain of $70.5 million on the sale of the business, primarily for the year ended February 29, 2020.

Nelson’s Green Brier acquisition

In May
2019, we increased our ownership interest in Tennessee-based Nelson’s Green Brier to 75%, resulting in consolidation of the business and recognition of a 25% noncontrolling interest. This acquisition included a portfolio of craft bourbon and whiskey products. The fair value of the business combination was allocated primarily to goodwill, trademarks, inventory, and property, plant, and equipment. The results of operations of Nelson’s Green Brier are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Canopy segment

Canopy investment

In May 2020, we exercised the November
2017 Canopy Warrants at an exercise price of C$12.98 per warrant share for C$245.0 million, or $173.9 million.

Results of Operations

Financial Highlights

References to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of recent divestitures, as appropriate.

For Fiscal 2021 compared with 

Fiscal 2020

:

•

Our results of operations benefited from the unrealized net gain of $802.0 million from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy in Fiscal 2021 a

nd improvements within the Beer segment.

•

Net sales increased 3%

 due to (i)
an increase in Beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth, (ii)
favorable impacts from pricing and product mix shift within both the Beer and the Wine and Spirits segments, partially offset by (i)
recent divestitures within both the Beer and the Wine and Spirits segments and (ii)
Wine and Spirits net sales led by branded volume decline largely from brands divested in January 2021.

•

Operating income increased 30%

 largely due to charges recognized for 

Fiscal 2020

 in connection with our business transformation strategy within the Wine and Spirits segment, including an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale primarily in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and an increase in Beer net sales in Fiscal 2021 driven by volume growth, partially offset by recent divestitures.

•

Net income attributable to CBI and diluted net income per common share attributable to CBI increased largely due to (i)
the increase in unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy in Fiscal 2021 as compared with the unrealized net loss in 

Fiscal 2020, (ii)
a

n impairment of long-lived assets held for sale in 

Fiscal 2020, and (iii)
volume growth within the Beer segment, partially offset by 

Fiscal 2021 provision for income taxes as compared with the benefit from income taxes for 

Fiscal 2020

Comparable Adjustments

Management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and the incentive compensation of segment management are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss) which do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.

As more fully described herein and in the Notes, the Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment results for each period are as follows:

Cost of product sold

Recovery of (loss on) inventory write-down

We recognized
a loss on the write-down of bulk wine inventory and certain grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the 2020 U.S. wildfires, partially offset by a related probable recovery from our insurance carriers (Fiscal 2021), and
a reimbursement from our insurance carriers for losses recognized on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2020). For additional information on the 2020 U.S. wildfires, refer to Note 16.

Strategic business development costs

We recognized costs primarily in connection with losses on write-downs of excess inventory and contract terminations resulting from our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio, gain efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the Wine and Spirits segment.

COVID-19 incremental costs

We recognized costs for incremental wages and hazard payments to employees, purchases of personal protective equipment, more frequent and thorough cleaning and sanitization of our facilities, and costs associated with the unused beer keg reimbursement program with distributors.

nventory step-up

In connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up. Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.

Accelerated depreciation

We recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with the multi-year implementation of a new global ERP system which is intended to replace our then-existing operating and financial systems.

Undesignated commodity derivative contracts

Net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts. The net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses

Restructuring and other strategic business development costs

We recognized costs primarily in connection with costs to optimize our portfolio, gain efficiencies, and reduce our cost structure within the Wine and Spirits segment.

Net gain (loss) on foreign currency derivative contracts

We recognized a net loss primarily in connection with the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts entered into to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the May 2020 Canopy Investment.

Transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs

We recognized transaction, integration, and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our investments, acquisitions, and divestitures.

Impairment of intangible assets

We recognized trademark impairment losses related to our Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer trademark asset (Fiscal 2021) and Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset (Fiscal 2020). For additional information, refer to Note 7.

COVID-19 incremental costs

We recognized costs for payments to third-party general contractors to maintain their workforce for expansion activities at the Obregon Brewery and recognized costs for incremental wages and hazard payments to employees.

Other gains (losses)

We recognized other gains (losses) primarily in connection with (i)
a gain recognized on the sale of a vineyard (Fiscal 2021), (ii)
a gain on the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in Nelson’s Green Brier to the acquisition-date fair value (Fiscal 2020), (iii)
an increase in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (Fiscal 2020), and (iv)
recognition of previously deferred gain upon release of a related guarantee (Fiscal 2020).

Impairment of assets held for sale

We recognized impairments of long-lived assets held for sale in connection with the (i)
Wine and Spirits Divestitures (Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020), (ii)
the Concentrate Business Divestiture (Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020), and (iii)

Gain (loss) on sale of business

We recognized a net gain (loss) primarily on the completion of the Paul Masson Divestiture, the Wine and Spirits Divestitures (Fiscal 2021), and the Black Velvet Divestiture (Fiscal 2020).

Income (loss) from unconsolidated investments

We recognized an unrealized gain (loss) primarily from (i)
the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value, (ii)
equity in earnings (losses) from Canopy’s results of operations, (iii)
equity losses from Canopy related to costs designed to improve their organizational focus, streamline operations, and align production capability with projected demand (Fiscal 2021), and (iv)
the increase in fair value resulting from the June 2019 modification of the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants (Fiscal 2020). For additional information, refer to Notes 7 and 10.

(2)

Depletions represent distributor shipments of our respective branded products to retail customers, based on third-party data.

The increase in Beer net sales is largely due to $451.6
million of volume growth within our Mexican beer portfolio, which benefited from continued consumer demand, new product introductions, and line extensions, $69.7
million favorable impact from pricing in select markets within our Mexican beer portfolio, and $35.0
million increase from favorable product mix shift, partially offset by $92.0
million from the Ballast Point Divestiture. Favorable product mix shift primarily resulted from increased sales of Corona Hard Seltzer and a reduction in on-premise keg sales. Inventory in our distribution channels returned to normal levels by the end of Fiscal 2021 following reduced production levels at our major breweries in Mexico earlier in the year.

The decrease in Wine and Spirits net sales is primarily due to $230.9
million from recent divestitures and $96.4
million decline in branded wine and spirits volume, driven by the brands divested in January 2021, partially offset by $102.5
million of favorable product mix shift and $51.1
million from favorable pricing. The Wine and Spirits Fiscal 2021 results have been negatively impacted by (i)
recent divestitures, (ii)
on-premise and retail tasting room closures as a result of COVID-19 containment measures, and (iii)
transition activities with distributors repositioning for ownership of brands, partially offset by an increase in off-premise and a continued focus on NPD and growing our brands.

[TABLE]

Canopy segment

Our ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. Amounts included for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy’s reported results on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy’s earnings (losses) from January through December 2020, in our Fiscal 2021 results and January through December 2019, in our Fiscal 2020 results. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of the Canopy results are included and subsequently eliminated to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements. See “Income (loss) from unconsolidated investments” below for a discussion of Canopy’s net sales, gross profit (loss), selling, general, and administrative expenses, and operating income (loss).

ITEM 7. MD&A

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

The increase in Beer is primarily due to $259.3
million of volume growth and the $69.7
million favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by $19.9
million of higher cost of product sold, $18.5
million decrease in gross profit due to the Ballast Point Divestiture, and $9.4
million of unfavorable product mix shift. The higher cost of product sold is largely due to $39.6
million increased operational costs and $3.8
million increased logistics costs, partially offset by $23.5
million of foreign currency transactional benefits. The increase in operational costs primarily consisted of (i)
$32.3 million of higher material costs, largely attributable to glass, and (ii)
$15.7 million of inflation and increased brewery compensation and benefits, partially offset by $20.4 million of favorable fixed cost absorption related to increased production in Fiscal 2021. The increase in logistics costs primarily consisted of $14.5 million increased transportation costs, partially offset by $11.8 million of decreased obsolescence driven by lower inventory levels as we replenished our distribution channels. Unfavorable product mix shift primarily resulted from increased sales of Corona Hard Seltzer, partially offset by a reduction in on-premise keg sales.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

The decrease in Wine and Spirits is largely due to a decrease of $90.0
million in gross profit due to the recent divestitures, $66.5
million higher cost of product sold, and $33.1
million of decline in branded wine and spirits volume, driven by the brands divested in January 2021, partially offset by $71.5
million of favorable product mix shift and the $51.1
million from favorable pricing. Higher cost of product sold was largely attributable to unfavorable fixed cost absorption including $28.6 million from decreased production levels at certain facilities in the second half of fiscal 2021 as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires, certain spirits packaging size obsolescence, increased winery compensation and benefits, as well as increased packaging costs, including glass and labels, partially offset by lower grape raw material costs.

[/TABLE]

Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 51.8% for Fiscal 2021 compared with 49.8% for Fiscal 2020. This was largely due to (i)
a favorable change of approximately 130
basis points in Comparable Adjustments, (ii)
favorable impacts from both Beer and Wine and Spirits pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 40
basis points and 30
basis points of rate growth, respectively, and (iii)
30
basis points of favorable impact from the recent divestitures, partially offset by approximately 80
basis points of rate decline from higher cost of product sold within the Wine and Spirits segment and an unfavorable product mix shift for the Beer segment contributing approximately 30
basis points of rate decline.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses

[TABLE]

The increase in Beer is primarily due to an increase of $26.9
million in marketing spend that was largely driven by increased advertising resulting from planned investments to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio predominantly in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

The increase in Wine and Spirits is primarily due to an increase of $8.6
million in marketing spend that was largely driven by an increased focus on eCommerce and digital marketing placement for our higher-end, higher-margin brands

and a $5.9
million increase in general and administrative expenses. The increase in general and administrative expenses is driven by increased compensation and benefits, partially offset by

a favorable impact from reduced travel driven by COVID-19 containment measures and certain cost saving initiatives.

The increase in Corporate Operations and Other is largely due to approximately a $15

million of unfavorable foreign currency losses, and an increase of $2
million in charitable contributions, primarily driven by COVID-19 support efforts, partially offset by decreased insurance related costs of $17
million and $6
million of favorable impact from reduced travel driven by COVID-19 containment measures.

[/TABLE]

Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased

 to 

19.3% for Fiscal 2021 as compared with 19.4% for Fiscal 2020. The decrease is driven largely by approximately 490
basis points of rate decline as the increase in Beer net sales exceeded the increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses, and 

approximately 

40
basis points in Comparable Adjustments rate decline, largely offset by 

approximately 

470

basis points of rate growth from the recent Wine and Spirits divestitures and 

an increase in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, which resulted in 45
basis points of rate growth.

(2)

Fiscal 2021 includes $359.6 million of costs designed to improve their organizational focus, streamline operations, and align production capability with projected demand and Fiscal 2020 includes our share of Canopy’s additional loss resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification of $409.0 million.

[TABLE]

Canopy segment

Canopy net sales increased to $378.6 million for Fiscal 2021 from $290.2 million for Fiscal 2020. This increase of $88.4 million, or 30% is primarily attributable to an increase in other product offering sales and international medical sales, as well as additional Canadian recreational sales. The increase in other sales resulted from (i) the expansion of their U.S. distribution network for vaporizers sold by Storz & Bickel GmbH & Co. KG, (ii) beauty, skincare, wellness, and sleep product sales from their May 2019 acquisition of This Works Products Limited, and (iii) sales of sports nutrition beverages, mixes, protein, gum, and mints from their October 2019 acquisition of BioSteel. The increase in international medical sales largely resulted from Canopy’s April 2019 acquisition of C

. Canadian recreational sales benefited from the introductions of retail stores across Canada and cannabis-infused beverages. Canopy gross profit (loss) decreased to $(14.1) million for Fiscal 2021 from $45.4 million for Fiscal 2020. This decrease of $59.5 million is primarily driven by inventory write-downs related to its organizational and strategic review of their business and detailed evaluation of inventory. Canopy selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $750.7 million primarily from (i)
their decision to close greenhouse facilities as well as other changes related to its organizational and strategic review of their business and (ii)
expected credit losses on financial assets and related charges, partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense. The combination of these factors were the main contributors to the increase in operating loss of $810.2 million.

[/TABLE]

Interest expense

Interest expense decreased to $385.7 million for Fiscal 2021 from $428.7 million for Fiscal 2020. This decrease of $43.0 million, or 10% is predominantly due to lower average borrowings of approximately $1.2
billion primarily attributable to the partial repayment of financing entered into in connection with the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.

(Provision for) benefit from income taxes

Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2021 was 20.1% of tax expense as compared with 102.3% of tax benefit for Fiscal 2020. In comparison to prior year, our taxes were negatively impacted primarily by:

•

the recognition of a $547.4
million net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets for Fiscal 2020 in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland,

•

lower net income tax benefits recorded for Fiscal 2021 as compared with Fiscal 2020 on the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy and Canopy equity in earnings (losses); and

•

a lower net income tax benefit from stock-based compensation award activity for Fiscal 2021 from changes in option exercise activity.

For additional information, refer to Note
13.

We expect our reported effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. This range includes the estimated impact of the expected long-lived asset impairment of brewery construction in progress. For additional information, refer to Note 23. Since estimates are not currently available, this range does not reflect any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investment measured at fair value and any future equity in earnings (losses) and related activities from the Canopy Equity Method Investment.

Net income (loss) attributable to CBI

Net income (loss) attributable to CBI increased to $1,998.0 million for Fiscal 2021 from $(11.8) million for Fiscal 2020. This increase of $2,009.8 million is largely attributable to (i)
the unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy in Fiscal 2021 as compared with an unrealized net loss in Fiscal 2020, (ii)
an impairment of long-lived assets held for sale for Fiscal 2020, (iii)
and strong volume growth within the Beer segment, partially offset by the Fiscal 2021 provision for income taxes as compared with a benefit from income taxes for Fiscal 2020.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities. Our ability to consistently generate robust cash flow from our operations is one of our most significant financial strengths, it enables us to invest in our people and brands, make capital investments and strategic acquisitions, provide a cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock. Our largest use of cash in our operations is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. Historically, we have used this cash flow to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures. Additionally, our commercial paper program is used to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets. We use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures. COVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy and financial markets. A prolonged impact could interfere with our ability to access sources of liquidity or at favorable rates and to generate sufficient operating cash flows. We also have used opportunities to defer some payments including certain payroll taxes under the CARES Act afforded to us during the pandemic.

We seek to maintain adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

On May
1, 2020, we exercised the November 2017 Canopy Warrants for an aggregate amount of C$245.0
million, or $173.9 million with cash from operations.

Cash flows

Operating activities

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2021 is largely due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven primarily by the segment’s solid operating results, combined with the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from reduced inventories for the Wine and Spirits segment as a result of the 2020 U.S. wildfires. The increase in net 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 7. MD&A

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by higher income tax payments in Fiscal 2021 primarily due to a change in estimated taxable income and the receipt of a federal tax refund in Fiscal 2020.

Investing activities

Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2021 decreased primarily due to higher proceeds from sale of business of $729.8 million for Fiscal 2021 as compared with Fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by the May 2020 exercise of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants for $173.9 million and higher Fiscal 2021 capital expenditures of $138.1 million.

Bank facilities

In March 2020, we entered into the 2020 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement. This resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the guarantee agreement, (ii) the inclusion of the parent guaranty provisions in connection with the termination of the guarantee agreement, (iii)
the removal of certain provisions pertaining to term loans since no term loans are outstanding, and (iv) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on the SOFR administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

In March 2020, we entered into the Term Loan Restatement Agreement and the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement, that amended and restated the Term Credit Agreement and the 2019 Term Credit Agreement, respectively. These new agreements each resulted in (i) the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements and (ii) the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions in each to permit the use of rates based on SOFR. We prepaid the remaining outstanding Three-Year Term Facility and Five-Year Term Facility borrowings under our 2020 Term Credit Agreement in Fiscal 2021.

Senior notes

In April 2020, we issued the April 2020 Senior Notes. Proceeds from this offering, net of discount and debt issuance costs, of $1,183.3 million were primarily used for the repayment of our 2.25% November 2017 Senior Notes and a portion of the Three-Year Term Facility outstanding obligations under our 2020 Term Credit Agreement.

In November 2020, we repaid the Senior Floating Rate Notes with cash on hand. In February 2021, we repaid the 3.75% May 2013 Senior Notes utilizing cash proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures.

General

The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of February
28, 2021, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2022 to calendar 2050, and a variable-rate senior

unsecured term loan facility under our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement, originally entered into in June 2019, with a calendar 2024 maturity date as follows:

Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion of commercial paper. Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2020
Credit Agreement. Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2020
Credit Agreement.

We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2020
Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings. We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2020
Credit Agreement.

We had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2020
Credit Agreement:

Net of outstanding revolving credit facility borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under our 2020
Credit Agreement and outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program.

The financial institutions participating in our 2020
Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe they will comply with any future funding requests. However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in our 2020
Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a

maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in our 2020
Credit Agreement. As of February
28, 2021, under our 2020 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 4.5x.

The representations, warranties, covenants, and events of default set forth in our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in our 2020 Credit Agreement.

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:
(i)
a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)
a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii)
restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

As of February
28, 2021, we were in compliance with our covenants under our 2020 Credit Agreement, our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement, and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

For further discussion and presentation of our borrowings and available sources of borrowing, refer to Note
12.

Common stock dividends

On April
7, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.76 per share of Class
A Common Stock, $0.69 per share of Class
B Convertible Common Stock, and $0.69 per share of Class
1 Common Stock payable on May
18, 2021, to stockholders of record of each class on May
4, 2021. We expect to return approximately $580 million to stockholders in Fiscal 2022 through cash dividends.

We currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend to stockholders of our common stock in the future, but such payments are subject to approval of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and other factors, including those set forth under Item
1A “Risk Factors” of this Form
10-K.

Share Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our Class
A Common Stock and Class
B Convertible Common Stock under the 2018
Authorization and the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock under the 2021
Authorization. Shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization have become treasury shares. No shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

As of February
28, 2021, total shares repurchased under the 2018 Authorization and the 2021 Authorization are as follows:

Share repurchases under the 2018
Authorization and 2021 Authorization may be accomplished at management’s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, our cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management. Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. We may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations and/or proceeds from borrowings. Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.

17.

Capital Resources

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt. Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments, periodic share repurchases, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs. As of February
28, 2021, our $460.6 million cash and cash equivalent balance reflects the recent sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business.

The following sets forth information about our outstanding obligations at February
28, 2021. For a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table, refer to Notes
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.

(1)

Interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to finance lease obligations as amounts are not material.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $204.7 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material. For a detailed discussion of these items, refer to Note
13.

(3)

Contracts to purchase equipment and services primarily related to the Obregon Brewery expansion. For further information about these purchase obligations, refer to “Capital Expenditures” below.

(4)

Publicly announced intent to return $5 billion in value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to be made from Fiscal
2020 through Fiscal 2023. We have returned $1,194.2 million through Fiscal 2021.

(5)

Publicly announced intent to invest (i)
$100 million in female-founded or led companies through our Focus on Female Founders program over a ten-year period concluding in fiscal 2029 and (ii)
$100 million to support African American/Black and minority-owned startups in the beverage alcohol space and related categories over a ten-year period concluding in fiscal 2031. We have invested $32.7 million through Fiscal 2021 in female-founded or led companies.

Capital expenditures

During Fiscal 2021, we incurred $864.6
million for capital expenditures, including $693.9
million for the Beer segment primarily for the Mexico Beer Projects.

We plan to spend from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in Fiscal 2022, including approximately $900
million for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Mexico Beer Projects. The remaining planned Fiscal 2022 capital expenditures consist of improvements to existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings. The Mexico Beer Projects are expected to be completed by Fiscal 2025. Accordingly, we expect to spend approximately $700
million to $900
million annually in Fiscal 2023 through Fiscal 2025 for the Beer segment. Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs.

In fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of our Mexicali Brewery. Following the negative result of the public consultation, we are in discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country. We intend to continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. At this time, we have suspended all Mexicali Brewery construction activities. See Note
23 for further discussion.

Critical accounting policies and estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1. Certain policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management to determine appropriate assumptions to be used in certain estimates; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Estimates are based on historical experience, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We review estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business on an ongoing basis. Our critical accounting estimates include:

•

Fair value of financial instruments. 

Management’s estimate of fair value requires significant judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and the availability of specific information. The fair values of our financial instruments that require the application of significant judgment by management are as follows:

Canopy investment

Equity securities, Warrants – estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement) and Monte Carlo simulations (Level 2 fair value measurement). These valuation models use various market-based inputs, including stock price, remaining contractual term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable. Management applies significant judgment in its determination of expected volatility. We consider both historical and implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and apply limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.

Debt securities, Convertible – estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level 2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date. This valuation model uses various market-based inputs, 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 7. MD&A

[/TABLE]

including stock price, remaining term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend yield, as applicable.

•

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill and other intangible assets are classified into three categories: (i)
goodwill, (ii)
intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization, and (iii)
intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding items such as future cash flows, revenues, earnings, and other factors. The assumptions used reflect management’s estimates and are based on historical trends, projections and assumptions, including expectations of future economic and competitive conditions that are used in current strategic operating plans, however, are subject to change as a result of changing market conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets. The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements. 

We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January
1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.

Goodwill – Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the quantitative assessment. No indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value. Based on this analysis, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Wine and Spirits reporting unit with approximately 108% excess fair value. For Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.

The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculation to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units in connection with the impairment testing are: (i)
the discount rate, (ii)
the expected long-term growth rate, and (iii)
the annual cash flow projections.

As of January
1, 2021, if we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit’s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its estimated fair value. Therefore, we did not have any indication of potential impairment.

Other intangible assets – consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Using the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method. 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer business recognized a $6.0 million impairment loss in connection with its trademark asset. Certain negative trends within our Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts indicating lower revenue and cash flow generation for the related portfolio. This change in financial forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners craft beer trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 7. MD&A

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset recognized an impairment loss of $11.0
million. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Beer segment’s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of $108.0 million in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. Refer to Note 7 for further discussion.

The most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:
(i)
the estimated royalty rate, (ii)
the discount rate, (iii)
the expected long-term growth rate, and (iv)
the annual revenue projections. As of January
1, 2021, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting’s carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.

Divestitures – When some, but not all of a reporting unit is disposed of, some of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of, if that portion constitutes a business. The allocation of goodwill is based on the relative fair values of the portion of the reporting unit being disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit remaining. This approach requires a determination of the fair value of both the business being disposed and the businesses retained within the reporting unit.

For 

Fiscal 2021, o

ur estimate of fair value for the Paul Masson Divestiture, the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, the Concentrate Business Divestiture, and the Ballast Point Divestiture was determined based on the expected proceeds from the transactions. The components sold were a part of the Wine and Spirits or Beer segment and were included in those reporting units through the date of divestiture. Goodwill was allocated to the assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the businesses being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the respective divestitures remained in the wine and spirits or beer reporting unit.

•

Accounting for income taxes. 

We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes, and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws, and tax planning strategies. We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S., and other jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved.

We believe all tax positions are fully supported. We recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting. Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 7. MD&A

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations. If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not they will not be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical, and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. We believe it is more likely than not the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances. Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

Change in Accounting Guidance

Accounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2021 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As a result of our global operating, investment, acquisition, and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices. To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we periodically purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap contracts, interest rate swap contracts, and treasury lock contracts. We use derivative instruments to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates, as well as to hedge economic exposures. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign currency and commodity price risk

Foreign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with investments, acquisitions, or divestitures outside the U.S. As of February
28, 2021, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, New Zealand dollar, and Canadian dollar. Approximately 100% of our balance sheet exposures and 82% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February
28, 2022, were hedged as of February
28, 2021.

Commodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges. As of February
28, 2021, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. Approximately 67% of our forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February
28, 2022, were hedged as of February
28, 2021.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market. The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. Gains or losses from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or losses on the derivative instruments. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows:

Interest rate risk

The estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt.

As of February
29, 2020, we had $375.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated interest rate swap agreements which fixed LIBOR interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our floating LIBOR rate debt. There were no cash flow designated interest rate swap contracts outstanding as of February
28, 2021. As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, there were no undesignated interest rate swap contracts outstanding.

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

As of February
29, 2020, we had $300.0 million of outstanding cash flow designated treasury lock agreements which fixed 10-year Treasury interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on our future debt

issuances. There were no cash flow designated treasury lock contracts outstanding as of February
28, 2021. As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, there were no undesignated treasury lock contracts outstanding.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates. The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value, and sensitivity analysis for our outstanding fixed-rate debt, including current maturities and open interest rate derivative instruments, are summarized as follows:

A 1% hypothetical change in the prevailing interest rates would have increased interest expense on our variable interest rate debt by $12.4 million and $26.7 million for the for the years ending February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, respectively.

Equity price risk

The estimated fair value of our investment in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities are subject to equity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and foreign currency risk. This investment is recognized at fair value utilizing various option-pricing models and has the potential to fluctuate from, among other items, changes in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. We manage our equity price risk exposure by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance, and outlook of Canopy.

As of February
28, 2021, the fair value of our investment in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities was $1,816.0 million, with an unrealized net gain (loss) on this investment of $802.0 million recognized in our results of operations for the year ended February
28, 2021. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of the equity price reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security. As of February
28, 2021, such a hypothetical 10% adverse change would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $282.7 million.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February
28, 2021.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Constellation Brands, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February
28, 2021, based on criteria established in

 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February
28, 2021, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of February
28, 2021 and February
29, 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February
28, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated April
20, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

20, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting

.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)
relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Fair value measurement of the Canopy warrants

As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company established policies for measuring the fair value of financial instruments, including the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. As of February
28, 2021, the recorded balance of the Company’s investment in the November 2018 Canopy Warrants was $1,639.7 million. The Company uses option pricing models to estimate the fair value of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants using various market-based inputs.

[TABLE]

[/TABLE]

We identified the evaluation of the fair value measurement of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants as a critical audit matter. Specifically, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment, including the involvement of valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, was required in evaluating the determination of the expected volatility inputs used in the option pricing models for the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Historical, implied, and peer group volatility levels provide a range of possible expected volatility inputs and the fair value estimates for the November 2018 Canopy Warrants were sensitive to the expected volatility inputs.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the fair value measurement of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. This included controls related to the evaluation of observable market information used in the determination of the expected volatility inputs. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the expected volatility inputs by comparing them against a volatility range that was independently developed in consideration of historical, implied, and peer group volatility information and in developing an estimate of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants’ fair value using the independently-developed volatility range and comparing it to the value determined by the Company.

Unrecognized tax benefits

As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company has recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $236.1 million as of February
28, 2021.

We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter. Specifically, complex auditor judgment, including the involvement of tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, was required in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its estimate of the ultimate resolution of its tax positions.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. This included controls related to the interpretation of tax law, its application in the liability estimation process, and the review of activity that could result in changes to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. We involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and tax authority rulings and in performing an independent assessment of certain of the Company’s tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefit, if any, and comparing the results to the Company’s assessment. We also involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing certain transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of business

Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry. We are an international beverage alcohol company with a powerful portfolio of consumer-connected, high-end imported beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands.

Basis of presentation

Principles of consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. In addition, we have an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The joint venture owns and operates a state-of-the-art glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for the Nava Brewery. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Equity method investments

If we are not required to consolidate our investment in another entity, we use the equity method when we (i)
can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii)
hold common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity. Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus our equity in the increases and decreases in the investee’s net assets after the date of acquisition. We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment. Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

Management’s use of estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Summary of significant accounting policies

Revenue recognition

Our revenue (referred to in our financial statements as “sales”) consists primarily of the sale of beer, wine, and spirits domestically in the U.S. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution, and shipping terms. We have elected to treat shipping as a fulfillment activity. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in sales.

As noted, the majority of our revenues are generated from the domestic sale of beer, wine, and spirits to wholesale distributors in the U.S. Our other revenue generating activities include the export of certain of our products to select international markets, as well as the sale of our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies and on-premise, retail locations in certain markets. We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the amended guidance and concluded that 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure. See Note 22 for disclosure of net sales by product type.

Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates. This variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors’ sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recognized. We estimate this variable consideration by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information, and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.

Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on our beverage alcohol products. Excise taxes are shown on a separate line item as a reduction of sales and are recognized in our results of operations when the related product sale is recognized. Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability in other accrued expenses and liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.

Cost of product sold

The types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses

The types of costs included in selling, general, and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs. Distribution network costs are included in cost of product sold. 
We expense advertising costs as incurred, shown, or distributed.
 Advertising expense for the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February
28, 2019, was $
805.0
 million, $
769.5
 million, and $
700.8
 million, respectively.

Foreign currency translation

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency. The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recognized as a component of AOCI. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Elements of cost include materials, labor, and overhead.

Bulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than one year. A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice. Warehousing, insurance, value added taxes, and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.

We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand, and market requirements.

Property, plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and improvements are recognized as an increase to the property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the balance sheet accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income.

Interest incurred relating to expansion, construction, and optimization of facilities is capitalized to construction in progress. We cease the capitalization of interest when construction activities are substantially completed and the facility and related assets are available for their intended use. At this point, construction in progress is transferred to the appropriate asset class.

Depreciation

Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Derivative instruments

We enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and interest rates. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at estimated fair value (see Notes 6 and 7). We present our derivative positions gross on our balance sheets.

The change in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. For all periods presented herein, gains or losses deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI are recognized in our results of operations in the same period in which the hedged items are recognized and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged items.

Changes in fair values for derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recognized directly in our results of operations each period and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged item. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our undesignated commodity derivative contracts, prior to settlement, is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results. Upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear on our statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged items.

Fair value of financial instruments

We calculate the estimated fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, we use standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, and convertible debt) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 7).

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. We review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We use January
1 as our annual impairment test measurement date. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks. Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Note
9 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.

Income taxes

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, GILTI, is subject to U.S. tax. We treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred. We provide deferred income taxes, consisting primarily of foreign withholding and state taxes, on all applicable unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of (provision for) benefit from income taxes.

We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination. We measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined. Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

Leases

We recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet in accordance with the FASB guidance for accounting for leases. We assess service arrangements to determine if an asset is explicitly or implicitly specified in the agreement and if we have the right to control the use of the identified asset. 

The right-of-use asset and lease liability are initially measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rates are determined using a portfolio approach based on publicly available information in connection with our unsecured borrowing rates. We elected to recognize expenses for leases with a term of 12 months or less on a straight-line basis over the lease term and not to recognize these short-term leases on the balance sheet.

The right-of-use asset and lease liability are calculated including options to extend or to terminate the lease when we determine that it is reasonably certain that we will exercise those options. In making that 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

determination, we consider various existing economic and market factors, business strategies as well as the nature, length, and terms of the agreement. Based on our evaluation using these factors, we concluded that the exercise of renewal options or early termination options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement for leases we currently have in place. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events such as a lease modification.

Certain of our contractual arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. We elected to measure the lease liability by combining the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all asset classes.

Certain of our leases include variable lease payments, including payments that depend on an index or rate, as well as variable payments for items such as raw materials, labor, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. Certain grape purchasing arrangements include variable payments based on actual tonnage and price of grapes. In addition, certain third-party logistics arrangements include variable payments that vary depending on throughput. Such variable lease payments are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

Indemnification liabilities

We have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures. Indemnification liabilities are recognized when probable and estimable and included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities (see Note 16).

Stock-based employee compensation

We have 
two
 stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 18). We apply grant date fair-value-based measurement methods in accounting for our stock-based payment arrangements and recognize all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions, net of expected forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability, or death of the employee (as defined by the plan), if earlier. For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility.

Net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI

We have 
two
 classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding:
Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (see Note 17). In addition, we have another class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding:
Class 1 Common Stock (see Note
17). If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 
ten
 percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. Class
B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder.

We use the two-class method for the computation and presentation of net income (loss) per common share attributable to CBI (hereafter referred to as “net income (loss) per common share”) (see Note 19). The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. Under the two-class method, Class A Common Stock is assumed to receive a 
ten
 percent greater participation in undistributed earnings (losses) than Class B Convertible Common Stock, in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stock.

Net income (loss) per common share – basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class method. Net income (loss) per common 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

[/TABLE]

share – diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the if-converted method for the years ended February
28, 2021 and February 28, 2019, and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method. For the year ended February 29, 2020, net income (loss) per common share - diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the two-class method. Net income (loss) per common share – diluted for Class B Convertible Common Stock is computed using the two-class method and does not assume conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

Divestiture, we recorded the results of operations of our Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy business in the Wine and Spirits segment. In connection with the Paul Masson Divestiture, we entered into a transition services agreement with Sazerac Company whereby our retained Mission Bell facility will provide certain bulk wine processing services at market rates for a period of up to three years. 
The following table summarizes the net gain recognized in connection with this divestiture for the year ended February
28, 2021:

Wine and Spirits Divestitures

On January
5, 2021, we sold a portion of our wine and spirits business, including lower-margin, lower growth wine and spirits brands, related inventory, interests in certain contracts, wineries, vineyards, offices, and facilities. We received net cash proceeds of $
538.4
 million, from the Wine and Spirits Divestiture, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. In addition, we have the potential to earn an incremental $
250

million of contingent consideration if certain brand performance targets are met over a two-year period after closing.

On January
5, 2021, in a separate, but related transaction with the same buyer, Gallo, we also sold the New Zealand-based Nobilo Wine brand and certain related assets. We received cash proceeds of $
129.0

million, from the Nobilo Wine Divestiture, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.

In connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, we entered into certain transition services agreements with Gallo whereby we provide certain cellar, package, and storage services primarily at Mission Bell. We recorded a $
13.0
 million liability related to the unfavorable transition services agreements, which was included in the net loss on sale of business and is being amortized over the expected term of the contracts to selling, general, and administrative expenses both within our consolidated results of operations.

The cash proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures were utilized to repay the 3.75% May 2013 Senior Notes (as defined in Note 12) and for other general corporate purposes. Prior to the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, we recorded the results of operations for this portion of our business in the Wine and Spirits segment.

million, and $
23.1

million for the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February

Mexicali Brewery

In fiscal 2017, we began construction of the Mexicali Brewery. In March 2020, a public consultation was held on the construction of the Mexicali Brewery. Following the negative result of the public consultation, we are in discussions with government officials in Mexico regarding next steps for our brewery construction project and options elsewhere in the country. We intend to continue working with government officials to mutually agree upon a path forward. As of February
28, 2021, we have suspended all Mexicali Brewery construction activities and have approximately $
710
 million of capitalized fixed assets remaining at the location. In addition to the capitalized costs, we have incurred other expenses in establishing the Mexicali Brewery. See Note
23 for further discussion.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Overview

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and equity prices that could affect our results of operations and financial condition. The impact on our results and financial position and the amounts reported in our financial statements will vary based upon the currency, commodity, interest rate, and equity market movements during the period, the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding, and whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting.

The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates, and/or equity prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures. Our derivative instruments are held solely to manage our exposures to the aforementioned market risks as part of our normal business operations. We follow strict policies to manage these risks and do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

We have an investment in certain equity securities and other rights which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of Canopy (see Note 10). This investment is included in securities measured at fair value and are accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of this investment recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 7).

The aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows:

Cash flow hedges

Our derivative instruments designated in hedge accounting relationships are designated as cash flow hedges. We are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases. We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks. In addition, we utilize interest rate swap and treasury lock contracts periodically to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within 
three years
 or less, with a maximum maturity of 
five years
.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed, and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged. Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures. All components of our derivative instruments’ gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

When we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively. In the event the relationship is no longer effective, we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of 

[TABLE]

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

[/TABLE]

operations. We also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i)
a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii)
it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii)
we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring, the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in AOCI and is reclassified into earnings (losses) when the forecasted transaction occurs. When it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any remaining gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in our results of operations.

We expect $
26.3
 million of net gains, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to our results of operations within the next 12 months.

Undesignated hedges

Certain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; for others, we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment. These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and foreign-denominated investments, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, including aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas, and wheat prices. We primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts, generally less than 
12
 months in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than 
36
 months in duration, with a maximum maturity of 
five years
, to hedge some of these risks. In addition, from time to time, we utilize interest rate swap contracts, generally less than 
six months
 in duration, to economically hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the financing of significant investments and acquisitions. Our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management.

Credit risk

We are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default. This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts. To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts. We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored. Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial.

In addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements. As of February
28, 2021, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was $
0.1
 million. If we were required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on February
28, 2021, we would have had sufficient available liquidity on hand to satisfy this obligation.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Authoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. The hierarchy includes three levels:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as volatility, interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly; and

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

Fair value methodology

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments:

Foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts

The fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, entered into valuation models. These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves, and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Interest rate swap and treasury lock contracts

The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties. Quotes are corroborated by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services (Level
2 fair value measurement).

Canopy investment

Equity securities, Warrants

 – 

The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy warrants are as follows:

(1)

The November 2017 Canopy Warrants were exercised on May
1, 2020 and as such are not included in the table as of February
28, 2021. For additional information on the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the related exercise, refer to Note
10.

(2)

The exercise price for the Tranche C Warrants is based on the VWAP Exercise Price and are not included in the table as there is no fair value assigned.

(3)

The fair value is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level
2 fair value measurement).

(4)

The fair value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations (Level
2 fair value measurement).

(5)

Based on the exercise price from the applicable underlying agreements.

(6)

Based on the closing market price for Canopy common stock on the TSX as of the applicable date.

(7)

Based on the following expiration dates:

(8)

Based on consideration of historical and/or implied volatility levels of the underlying equity security and limited consideration of historical peer group volatility levels.

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

[/TABLE]

(9)

Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expiration date of the applicable warrants.

(10)

Based on historical dividend levels.

Debt securities, Convertible

 – 

We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities for C$
200.0
 million, or $
150.5
 million. Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense. The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance but may be converted prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events. At settlement, the Canopy Debt Securities can be settled at the option of the issuer, in cash, equity shares of the issuer, or a combination thereof. The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level
2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on market spreads using bond data as of the valuation date.

The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows:

(1)

Based on the rate which the Canopy Debt Securities may be converted into equity shares, or the equivalent amount of cash, at the option of the issuer.

(2)

Based on the closing market price for Canopy common stock on the TSX as of the applicable date.

(3)

Based on the contractual maturity date of the notes.

(4)

Based on historical volatility levels of the underlying equity security, reduced for certain risks associated with debt securities.

(5)

Based on the implied yield currently available on Canadian Treasury zero coupon issues with a term equal to the remaining contractual term of the Canopy Debt Securities.

(6)

Based on historical dividend levels.

Short-term borrowings

The revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility). Its fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level
2 fair value measurement). The remaining instruments, including our commercial paper, are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.

Long-term debt

The term loan under our March 2020 Term Credit Agreement is a variable interest rate bearing note with a fixed margin, adjustable based upon our debt rating. The carrying value approximates the fair value of the term loan. The fair value of the remaining fixed interest rate long-term debt is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level
2 fair value measurement).

The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings, approximate fair value as of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. As of February
28, 2021, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $
10,442.3

million, compared with an 

[TABLE]

estimated fair value of $
11,580.9
 million. As of February
29, 2020, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $
11,945.7
 million, compared with an estimated fair value of $
12,935.9

(1)

The balance at February
29, 2020, has been reclassified to assets held for sale (see “Trademarks” below for further discussion).

Long-lived assets held for sale

For the year ended February
28, 2021, primarily in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $
736.4
 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $
712.4
 million, less costs to sell, resulting in a total loss of $
24.0

million. This loss was included in impairment of assets held for sale within our consolidated results of operations. These assets consisted primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, and certain winery and vineyard assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimated fair value was determined as of November
30, 2020, primarily based on the expected proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, excluding the contingent consideration, which we will recognize when it is determined to be realizable.

For the year ended February
29, 2020, in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $
1,291.2
 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $
908.2
 million, less costs to sell, resulting in a total loss of $
407.0
 million. This loss was included in impairment of assets held for sale within our consolidated results of operations. These assets consisted primarily of goodwill, intangible assets, and certain winery and vineyard assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was determined as of February
29, 2020, based on the expected proceeds from the Wine and Spirits Divestitures and the Concentrate Business Divestiture, excluding the contingent consideration.

For the year ended February
29, 2020, in connection with the Ballast Point Divestiture, long-lived assets held for sale with a carrying value of $
81.3
 million were written down to their estimated fair value of $
41.1
 million, less costs to sell. As a result, a loss of $
42.7
 million, inclusive of costs to sell and other losses was included in impairment of assets held for sale for the year ended February
29, 2020. These assets consisted primarily of intangible assets and certain production and warehouse assets which had satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as held for sale. Our estimate of fair value was determined based on the expected proceeds from the Ballast Point Divestiture as of February
29, 2020. Ballast Point was a component of the Beer segment and was 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

[/TABLE]

included in our beer reporting unit through the date of divestiture. Accordingly, goodwill was allocated to the Ballast Point assets held for sale based on the relative fair value of the business being sold compared to the relative fair value of the reporting unit. Goodwill not allocated to assets associated with the Ballast Point Divestiture remained in the beer reporting unit.

Trademarks

For the year ended February
28, 2021, certain negative trends within our Beer segment’s Four Corners craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts. The updated forecasts indicated it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Four Corners trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Four Corners trademark asset with a carrying value of $
10.0
 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $
4.0

million, resulting in an impairment of $
6.0
 million. This impairment was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February
28, 2021.

For the year ended February
29, 2020, certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including increased rate of revenue decline and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the Ballast Point craft beer trademark might be below its carrying value. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $
28.0
 million was written down to its estimated fair value of $
17.0
 million, resulting in an impairment of $
11.0
 million.

This impairment was included in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations for the year ended February
29, 2020.

For the year ended February 28, 2019, in connection with certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, we implemented a change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio. This change in strategy, when combined with the continuing negative trends, indicated that it was more likely than not the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademark might be below its carrying value. The change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio focuses on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets. This change in strategy resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts with lower revenues, and cash flows for the related portfolio. Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset. As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of $
136.0

million was written down to its estimated fair value of $
28.0
 million, resulting in an impairment of $
108.0

million.

When performing a quantitative assessment for impairment of a trademark asset, we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the trademark asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the trademark asset. The cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair value of our trademark assets involve several assumptions, including (i)
projected revenue growth rates, (ii)
estimated royalty rates, (iii)
after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks, and (iv)
discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademark assets.

GOODWILL

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

(1)

Purchase accounting allocations associated primarily with the acquisition of Nelson’s Green Brier.

(2)

Primarily in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestitures, goodwill associated with the businesses being sold was reclassified (to) from assets held for sale based on the relative fair values of the portion of the business being sold and the remaining wine and spirits and beer portfolios. The relative fair values were determined using the income approach based on assumptions, including projected revenue growth rates, terminal growth rate, and discount rate and other projected financial information.

(3)

Preliminary purchase accounting allocations associated primarily with the acquisition of Empathy Wines.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The major components of intangible assets are as follows:

The intangible assets balance at February
29, 2020, excludes intangible assets reclassified to assets held for sale, which consist primarily of trademarks. We did not incur costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets for the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February
28, 2019. Net carrying amount represents the gross carrying value net of accumulated amortization. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

Our equity method investments are as follows:

(1)

The other equity method investments balance at February
29, 2020, excludes investments reclassified to assets held for sale.

Canopy Equity Method Investment

In November 2017, we acquired 
18.9
 million common shares, which represented a 
9.9
% ownership interest in Canopy, an Ontario, Canada-based public company and leading provider of medicinal and recreational cannabis products, plus warrants which gave us the option to purchase an additional 
18.9
 million common shares of Canopy. The November 2017 Canopy Investment was accounted for at fair value from the date of investment through October
31, 2018. From November
1, 2018, the November 2017 Canopy Investment has been accounted for under the equity method. The November 2017 Canopy Warrants were accounted for at fair value from the date of investment through April 30, 2020. See “May 2020 Canopy Investment” and “Canopy Equity Method Investment” below.

In November
2018, we increased our ownership interest in Canopy by acquiring an additional 
104.5
 million common shares (see “Canopy Equity Method Investment” below), plus warrants which give us the option to purchase an additional 
139.7
 million common shares of Canopy for C$
5,078.7
 million, or $
3,869.9
 million. On November
1, 2018, our ownership interest in Canopy increased to 
36.6
% which allowed us to exercise significant influence, but not control, over Canopy.

In May
2020, we exercised the November
2017 Canopy Warrants at an exercise price of C$
12.98
 per warrant share for C$
245.0
 million, or $
173.9
 million. The May 2020 Canopy Investment increased our ownership interest in Canopy to 
38.6
% upon exercise. We entered into foreign currency forward contracts to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the May 2020 Canopy Investment. For the year ended February
28, 2021, we recognized net losses on the foreign currency forward contracts of $
7.5
 million, in selling, general, and administrative expenses within our consolidated results of operations. The payment at maturity of the derivative instruments is reported as cash flows from investing activities in investments in equity method investees and securities for the year ended February
28, 2021.

We account for the November
2017 Canopy Investment, the November
2018 Canopy Investment, and the May 2020 Canopy Investment, each of which represents an investment in common shares of Canopy, collectively, under the equity method. Equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities (see table below) include, among other items, restructuring and other strategic business development

costs, the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, the flow through of inventory step-up, unrealized gains (losses) associated with changes in our Canopy ownership percentage resulting from periodic equity issuances made by Canopy, and our share of Canopy’s additional loss resulting from the June 2019 Warrant Modification of $
409.0
 million.

Amounts included in our consolidated results of operations for each period are as follows:

In June
2019, the Canopy shareholders approved the modification of the terms of the warrants originally obtained in November 2018 and certain other rights, and the other required approvals necessary for the modifications to be effective were granted. The November 2018 Canopy Warrants now consist of three tranches of warrants, including 
88.5
 million Tranche A Warrants expiring November
1, 2023 which are currently exercisable, 
38.4
 million Tranche B Warrants expiring November
1, 2026, and 
12.8
 million Tranche C Warrants expiring November
1, 2026. These changes are the result of Canopy’s intention to acquire Acreage upon U.S. federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions. In connection with the Acreage Transaction, Canopy had a call option to acquire 
100
% of the shares of Acreage.

The other rights obtained in June 2019 in connection with the Acreage Transaction include a share repurchase credit and the ability to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement transactions. If Canopy has not purchased the lesser of 
27,378,866
 Canopy common shares, or C$
1,583.0
 million worth of Canopy common shares for cancellation between April
18, 2019 and two-years after the full exercise of the Tranche A Warrants, we will be credited an amount that will reduce the aggregate exercise price otherwise payable upon each exercise of the Tranche B Warrants and Tranche C Warrants. The credit will be an amount equal to the difference between C$
1,583.0

million and the actual price paid by Canopy in purchasing its common shares for cancellation. If we choose to purchase Canopy common shares on the open market or in private agreement with existing holders, the number of Tranche B Warrants or Tranche C Warrants shall be decreased by one for each Canopy common share acquired, up to an aggregate maximum reduction of 
20
 million warrants. The likelihood of receiving the share repurchase credit if we were to fully exercise the Tranche A Warrants is remote, therefore, no fair value has been assigned.

The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants as of the June
27, 2019 modification date, were as follows:

Refer to Note 7 for input descriptions.

Accordingly, we recognized a $
1,176.0
 million unrealized gain from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results of operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 from the June 2019 Warrant Modification. Approximately $
322.5
 million of the unrealized gain was associated with the Tranche A Warrants and $
853.5
 million was associated with the Tranche B Warrants. No value was associated with the Tranche C Warrants as they have a VWAP Exercise Price.

In September 2020, the Acreage shareholders approved the modification of the Acreage Transaction and related Acreage Financial Instrument, and the other required regulatory approvals necessary for the modification to be effective were granted. The New Acreage Agreement reduces (i)
the ratio of Canopy shares required to be exchanged for Acreage shares upon U.S. federal cannabis legalization and (ii)
the number of Acreage shares subject to the fixed exchange ratio from 
100
% to 
70
%, calculated as a percentage of Acreage’s issued and outstanding shares. The remaining 
30
% of Acreage shares will be subject to a floating exchange ratio and Canopy, at its sole discretion, will have the option to acquire these shares with Canopy shares, cash, or a combination thereof.

In February 2021, Canopy sold its ownership interest in RIV Capital in exchange for (i)
exchangeable shares, warrants, and debt in TerrAscend Corp., (ii)
shares in Les Serres Vert Cannabis Inc., and (iii)
the termination of a royalty agreement with The Tweed Tree Lot Inc. As additional consideration for the assets being transferred and termination of the royalty agreement, Canopy made a cash payment of C$
115

million and issued 
3,647,902
 Canopy shares. The RIV Capital Divestiture has a minor dilutive impact on our ownership interest in Canopy which we will reflect in our first quarter of fiscal 2022 results.

Canopy has various equity and convertible debt securities outstanding, including primarily equity awards granted to its employees, and options and warrants issued to various third parties, including our November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the New Acreage Financial Instrument. As of February
28, 2021, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties, excluding our November 2018 Canopy Warrants, Canopy Debt Securities, and the New Acreage Financial Instrument, would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses. Additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest. If we exercised all of our November 2018 Canopy Warrants, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would be expected to increase to greater than 50%. If Canopy exercised the New Acreage Financial Instrument, which would require the issuance of Canopy shares, it could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses and our ownership interest in Canopy would decrease and no longer be expected to be greater than 50%.

As of February
28, 2021, the exercise of all Canopy warrants held by us would have required a cash outflow of approximately $
6.3
 billion based on the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants. Additionally, as of February
28, 2021, the fair value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment was $
4,679.3
 million based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of that date.

The following tables present summarized financial information for Canopy prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recognize our equity in earnings (losses) for Canopy on a two-month lag. Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy’s earnings (losses) for the periods (i)
January through December 2020 in our year ended February
28, 2021 results, (ii)
January through December 2019 in our year ended February
29, 2020, results, and (iii)
November and December 2018, in our year ended February
28, 2019 results. The amounts shown represent 100% of Canopy’s financial position and results of operations, for the respective periods, however, the results of operations for the year ended February
29, 2020, exclude the impact of the June 2019 Warrant Modification Loss because it was recorded by Canopy within equity. The year ended February
28, 2021, includes costs designed to improve Canopy’s organizational focus, streamline operations, and align production capability with projected demand.

Senior credit facility

In August 2018, the Company, CIH, CB International, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into the August 2018 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated our then-existing senior credit facility (as amended and restated by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement, the August 2018 Credit Agreement). The principal changes effected by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement were:

•

the removal of CIH as a borrower under the August 2018 Credit Agreement;

•

the termination of a cross-guarantee agreement by CIH and CB International; and

•

the addition of a mechanism to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate in certain circumstances where LIBOR cannot be adequately ascertained or available.

In September 2018, the Company, CB International, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into the 2018 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the August 2018 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2018 Restatement Agreement, the 2018 Credit Agreement). The primary change effected by the 2018 Restatement Agreement was the increase of the revolving credit facility from $
1.5
 billion to $
2.0
 billion and extension of its maturity to September
14, 2023. The 2018 Restatement Agreement also modified certain financial covenants in connection with the November
2018 Canopy Transaction and added various representations and warranties, covenants, and an event of default related to the November
2018 Canopy Transaction.

In June 2019, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the U.S. Term A-1 loan facility under the 2018 Credit Agreement with proceeds from the 2019 Term Credit Agreement.

In March 2020, the Company, CB International, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into the 2020 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2018 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2020 Restatement Agreement, the 2020 Credit Agreement). The 2020 Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate revolving credit facility of $
2.0
 billion. The principal changes effected by the 2020 Restatement Agreement were:

•

the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the guarantee agreement;

•

the inclusion of the parent guaranty provisions in connection with the termination of the guarantee agreement; 

•

the removal of certain provisions pertaining to term loans since no term loans are outstanding; and

•

the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on the SOFR administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Upon removal of all subsidiary guarantors from our 2020 Credit Agreement, the subsidiary guarantors were automatically released from the indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes.

2020 Term Credit Agreement

In September 2018, the Company, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into the Term Credit Agreement. The Term Credit Agreement provided for aggregate credit facilities of $
1.5
 billion, consisting of the $
500.0
 million three-year term loan facility and a $
1.0
 billion five-year term loan facility.

In March 2020, the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into the Term Loan Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the Term Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the Term Loan Restatement Agreement, the 2020 Term Credit Agreement). The principal changes effected by the Term Loan Restatement Agreement were:

•

the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements; and

March 2020 Term Credit Agreement

In June 2019, the Company and the Administrative Agent and Lender entered into the 2019 Term Credit Agreement. The 2019 Term Credit Agreement provides for the creation of a $
491.3
 million five-year term loan facility. The 2019 Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.

In March 2020, the Company, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, and the Lender entered into the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the 2019 Term Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement, the March 2020 Term Credit Agreement). The principal changes effected by the 2020 Term Loan Restatement Agreement were:

•

the removal of the subsidiary guarantees and termination of the respective guarantee agreements; and

•

the revision of the LIBOR successor rate provisions to permit the use of rates based on SOFR.

General

We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2020 Credit Agreement and the March 2020 Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions, and thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio.

Our senior credit facility permits us to elect, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions, to increase the revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans. The Incremental Facilities may be an unlimited amount so long as our leverage ratio, as defined and computed pursuant to our senior credit facility, is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subject to certain limitations for the period defined pursuant to our senior credit facility.

As of February
28, 2021, aggregate credit facilities under the 2020 Credit Agreement and the March 2020 Term Credit Agreement consist of the following:

(1)

Contractual interest rate varies based on our debt rating (as defined in the respective agreement) and is a function of LIBOR plus a margin, or the base rate plus a margin, or, in certain circumstances where LIBOR cannot be adequately ascertained or available, an alternative benchmark rate plus a margin.

(2)

We and/or CB International are the borrower under the $
2,000.0
 million revolving credit facility. Includes a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $
200.0
 million.

Interest rate swap contracts

In June 2019, we entered into interest rate swap agreements, which were designated as cash flow hedges for $

Subsidiary credit facilities

General

We have additional credit arrangements totaling $
61.2
 million and $
71.8
 million as of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, respectively. As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, amounts outstanding under these arrangements were $
15.5
 million and $
25.3
 million, respectively, the majority of which is classified as long-term as of the respective date. These arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations (see “Other long-term debt” for additional information). Interest rates and other terms of these borrowings vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions.

Other long-term debt

During the year ended February

(1)

Includes differences resulting from adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.

(2)

The year ended February
28, 2021, represents a net income tax (provision) benefit resulting from initiatives under the CARES Act. The year ended February
29, 2020, represents the recognition of a net income tax benefit resulting from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets in connection with the September 2019 enactment of tax reform in Switzerland. The year ended February
28, 2019, represents the recognition of a net income tax benefit related to the TCJ Act.

(3)

Consists of the following (i)
difference between the U.S. statutory rate and local jurisdiction tax rates, (ii)
the provision for incremental U.S. taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries offset by foreign tax credits, (iii)
the non-U.S. portion of tax provision (benefit) recorded on the net unrealized gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our investment in Canopy, and (iv)
the non-U.S. portion of tax benefits recorded on the Canopy equity in earnings (losses) and related activities.

Represents the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income.

Significant components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In making this assessment, we consider the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income as well as tax planning strategies. Based upon this assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation allowances.

As of February
28, 2021, operating loss carryforwards, which are primarily state and foreign, totaling $
1.6

billion are being carried forward in a number of jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. Of these operating loss carryforwards, $
1.2
 billion will expire by fiscal 2027, $
344.1
 million will expire between fiscal 2028 and fiscal 2041, and $
92.5
 million of operating losses in certain jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, as of February
28, 2021, federal capital losses totaling $
168.1
 million are being carried forward and will expire in fiscal 2022.

We have recognized valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized. The increase in our valuation allowances as of February
28, 2021, primarily relate to adjustments in expected utilization of capital loss carryforwards in connection with the Wine and Spirits Divestiture and the Paul Masson Divestiture.

The liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, and a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is as follows:

As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, we had $
268.9
 million and $
276.2
 million, respectively, of non-current unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, recognized on our balance sheets. These liabilities are recorded as non-current as payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date.

As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, we had $
236.1
 million and $
249.4
 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate in the year of resolution.

We file U.S. federal income tax returns and various state, local, and foreign income tax returns. Major tax jurisdictions where we are subject to examination by tax authorities include Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, and the U.S. Various U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax examinations are currently in progress. It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities will increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation. As of February
28, 2021, we estimate that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities could change by a range of $
1
 million to $
8

million. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to February
28, 2014.

We provide for additional tax expense based on probable outcomes of ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. While it is often difficult to predict the outcome or the timing of resolution of any tax matter, we believe the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Purchase commitments and contingencies

We have entered into various long-term contracts in the normal course of business for the purchase of (i)
certain inventory components, (ii)
transportation, marketing, and warehousing services, (iii)
IT contracts, (iv)
certain energy requirements, and (v)
property, plant, and equipment and related contractor and manufacturing services. 
As of February
28, 2021, the estimated aggregate minimum purchase commitments under these contracts are as follows:

(1)

Certain grape purchasing arrangements include the purchase of grape production yielded from specified blocks of a vineyard. The actual tonnage and price of grapes that we purchase will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions, and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard. Amounts included herein for the estimated aggregate minimum grape purchase commitments consist of estimates for the purchase of the grapes and the implicit leases of the land. Certain grape purchasing arrangements classified as leases have not resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet due to their variable nature.

(2)

Consists of purchase commitments entered into primarily in connection with the expansion project for the Obregon Brewery.

Additionally, we have entered into various contractual arrangements with affiliates of Owens-Illinois primarily for the purchase of glass bottles used largely in our imported and craft beer portfolios. Amounts purchased under these arrangements for the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February
28, 2019, were $
154.7
 million, $
166.6
 million, and $
238.8
 million, respectively.

Indemnification liabilities

In connection with prior divestitures, we have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise subsequent to the divestiture. As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, these liabilities consist primarily of indemnifications related to certain lease contracts and income tax matters. During the year ended February
28, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Accolade Wine Investment, we were released from certain guarantees and we recognized a gain of $
3.7
 million as part of the net gain on the sale of this business. This net gain is included in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments within our consolidated results of operations. As of February
28, 2021, and February
29, 2020, the carrying amount of our indemnification liabilities was $
17.0

million and $
9.1
 million, respectively, and is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities. We do not expect to be required to make material payments under the indemnifications and we believe that the likelihood is remote that the indemnifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations.

Legal matters

In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration, claims, and other legal proceedings in connection with our business. Some of the legal actions include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory and/or punitive damages and/or injunctive relief. A substantial adverse judgment or other unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Management believes that we have adequate legal defenses with respect to 

[TABLE]

[/TABLE]

the legal proceedings to which it is a defendant or respondent and that the outcome of these pending proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

Regulatory matters

We are in discussions with various governmental agencies concerning matters raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to such agencies’ inquiry. These matters could result in censures, fines, or other sanctions. Management believes the outcome of any pending regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

2020 U.S. wildfires

In August 2020, significant wildfires broke out in California, Oregon, and Washington states which affected the U.S. grape harvest. None of our facilities were damaged. At this time, we continue to expect no material impact to our ability to meet customer demand. Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by supply contracts from independent growers which, in many cases, allow for us to reject grapes that do not meet required quality specifications, including from smoke damage. We continue to assess when to use our rights under law and our supply contracts to reject grapes that are damaged from wildfires. For the year ended February
28, 2021, we recognized a $
78.6
 million loss in connection with the write-down of bulk wine inventory and certain

grapes as a result of smoke damage sustained during the 2020 U.S. wildfires. This loss was included in cost of product sold within our consolidated results of operations. We have insurance coverage that partially covers losses for grapes in our own vineyards. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we determined a loss recovery from our insurance carriers was realizable and recognized $
8.2
 million in cost of product sold within our consolidated results of operations. While we are continuing to pursue reimbursement, there can be no assurance there will be any additional recoveries. We test the grapes acquired under our supply contracts for smoke damage and other issues prior to accepting them. Additionally, for the year ended February
28, 2021, we recognized $
28.6
 million in unfavorable fixed cost absorption from decreased production levels at certain facilities as period costs in cost of product sold within our consolidated results of operations in the Wine and Spirits segment rather than capitalized in inventories.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common stock

We have 
two
 classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding:
Class
A Common Stock and Class
B Convertible Common Stock. Class
B Convertible Common Stock shares are 
convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis
 at any time at the option of the holder. Holders of Class
B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to 
ten votes per share
. Holders of Class
A Common Stock are entitled to 
one vote per share
 and a cash dividend premium. If we pay a cash dividend on Class
B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class
A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 
ten
 percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class
B Convertible Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class
A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class
B Convertible Common Stock. However, our senior credit facility limits the cash dividends that we can pay on our common stock to a fixed amount per quarter but the fixed amount may be exceeded subject to various conditions set forth in the senior credit facility.

In addition, we have a class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding:
Class
1 Common Stock. Shares of Class
1 Common Stock 
generally have no voting rights
. Class
1 Common Stock shares are 
convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis
 at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class
A Common Stock acquired upon conversion. Because shares of Class
1 Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class
A Common Stock, for each share of Class
1 Common Stock issued, we must reserve one share of Class
A Common Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class
1 Common Stock. Holders of Class
1 Common Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors. If we pay a cash dividend on Class
1 Common Stock, each share of Class
A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 
ten
 percent greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class
1 Common Stock. In addition, the Board of Directors may declare 

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

and pay a dividend on Class
A Common Stock without paying a dividend on Class
1 Common Stock. The cash dividends declared and paid on Class
B Convertible Common Stock and Class
1 Common Stock must always be the same.

The number of shares of common stock issued and treasury stock, and associated share activity, are as follows:

(1)

Shares of our Class A Treasury Stock were retired to authorized and unissued shares of our Class A Common Stock.

(2)

Net of the following shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements:

(3)

Includes use of Class A Treasury Stock associated with stock option exercises beginning March
1, 2019.

Stock repurchases

In January 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
3.0
 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. In January
2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
2.0
 billion of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. Shares may

be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Shares repurchased under these authorizations will become treasury shares.

A summary of share repurchase activity is as follows:

(1)

As of February
28, 2021, $
1,954.1
 million remains available for future share repurchase under the 2018 Authorization. The Board of Directors did not specify a date upon which the 2018 Authorization would expire.

(2)

As of February
28, 2021, 
no
 shares have been repurchased under the 2021 Authorization. The Board of Directors did not specify a date upon which the 2021 Authorization would expire.

Common stock dividends

In April
2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.76
 per share of Class A Common Stock, $
0.69
 per share of Class B Convertible Common Stock, and $
0.69
 per share of Class 1 Common Stock payable in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

We have 
two
 stock-based employee compensation plans (as further discussed below). 
Total compensation cost recognized for our stock-based awards and income tax benefits related thereto are as follows:

Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan

Under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may be granted to our employees, officers, and directors. The aggregate number of shares of our Class
A Common Stock and Class
1 Common Stock available for awards under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is 
108,000,000
 shares.

The exercise price, vesting period, and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the “Committee”). The exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the fair market value of our Class
A Common Stock on the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a 
four
-year period from the date of grant and expire as established by the Committee, but not later than 
ten years
 after the grant date.

Grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting periods, terms, conditions, and other requirements as the Committee may establish. Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on service and generally vest over 

one

 to 

four years

 from the date of grant. Performance share unit awards are based on service and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and vest over a required employee service period, generally from 
one
 to 
three years
 from

the date of grant, which closely matches the performance period. The performance conditions include the achievement of specified financial or operational performance metrics, or market conditions which require the achievement of specified levels of shareholder return relative to other companies as defined in the applicable performance share unit agreement. The actual number of shares to be awarded upon vesting of a performance share unit award will range between 
0
% and 
200
% of the target award, based upon the measure of performance as certified by the Committee.

A summary of stock option activity under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:

As of February
28, 2021, the aggregate intrinsic value of our options outstanding and exercisable was $
367.5
 million and $
303.6
 million, respectively. In addition, the weighted average remaining contractual life for our options outstanding and exercisable was 
5.6
 years and 
3.8
 years, respectively.

The fair value of stock options vested, and the intrinsic value of and tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options, are as follows:

The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock options granted and the weighted average inputs used to estimate the fair value on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:

(1)

Based on historical experience of employees’ exercise behavior for similar type awards.

(2)

Based primarily on historical volatility levels of our Class
A Common Stock.

.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 
9,000,000
 shares of Class
A Common Stock may be issued. Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of our Class
A Common Stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is the lower of 
85
% of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period. For the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February
28, 2019, employees purchased 
67,801
 shares, 
69,324
 shares, and 
76,844
 shares, respectively, under this plan.

Other

As of February
28, 2021, there was $
66.8
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under our stock-based employee compensation plans. This cost is expected to be recognized in our results of operations over a weighted-average period of 
2.1
 years. With respect to the issuance of shares under any of our stock-based compensation plans, we have the option to issue authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

Net sales to our five largest customers represented 
31.8

32.7
% of our net sales for the years ended February
28, 2021, February
29, 2020, and February

Net sales to an individual customer which amount to 10% or more of our net sales, and the associated amounts receivable from this customer as a percentage of our accounts receivable, are as follows:

[TABLE]

PART II

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Table of Contents

[/TABLE]

Net sales for the above customer are primarily reported within the Wine and Spirits segment. Our arrangements with certain of our customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice. The majority of our accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial position, and management is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of our customers and geographic sales area.

Subsequent event

Effective April
1, 2021, approximately 
70
% of our branded wine and spirits portfolio volume in the U.S. is expected to be distributed through an expanded relationship with a single distributor, Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

Our internal management financial reporting to consists of 

three
 business divisions:
(i)
Beer, (ii)
Wine and Spirits, and (iii)
Canopy and 

we report our operating results in 

four
 segments:
(i)

Beer, (ii)

Wine and Spirits, (iii)
Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv)

Canopy. The Canopy Equity Method Investment

 makes up the Canopy segment.

In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported beer, craft beer, and ABA brands. We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market, and sell our Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, 

as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function

. All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are, therefore, not allocated to the other reportable segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our CODM’s evaluation of the operating income (loss) performance of the other reportable segments. 

The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Long-lived tangible assets and total asset information by segment is not provided to, or reviewed by, our

 CODM

 as it is not used to make strategic decisions, allocate resources, or assess performance.

In addition, management excludes Comparable Adjustments from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments. Segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based upon core segment operating income (loss). As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Mexicali Brewery

In April 2021, our Board of Directors authorized management to sell or abandon the Mexicali Brewery. Subsequently, management determined that we will be unable to use or repurpose certain assets at the Mexicali Brewery. Accordingly, in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect to recognize a long-lived asset impairment of approximately $
650
 million to $
680
 million which will be included within our consolidated results of operations. The fair value will be determined based on the expected salvage value of the abandoned assets as of April 2021. We are continuing to work with government officials in Mexico to (i) determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project and (ii) pursue various forms of recovery for capitalized costs and additional expenses incurred in establishing the brewery, however, there can be no assurance of any recoveries. In the medium-term, under normal operating conditions, we have ample capacity at the Nava and Obregon breweries to meet consumer needs based on current growth forecasts and current and planned production capabilities. To align with our anticipated future growth expectations we are also working with the Mexican government to explore options to add further capacity at another location in Southeastern Mexico where there is ample water and a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure controls and procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i)
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii)
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal control over financial reporting

See page 
59
 of this Form 10-K for Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, which is incorporated herein by reference.

See page 
60
 of this Form 10-K for the attestation report of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Although most of our corporate and non-production workforce are working remotely due to COVID-19, we have not experienced a material impact to our internal control over financial reporting. We continue to monitor the pandemic and its effects on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls. 

We are in the process of implementing a new global ERP system across our business units using a phased approach. On March 1, 2021, business units in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy implemented the new ERP. This will result in changes in our internal controls for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2021. We do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our internal controls over financial reporting.

In connection with management’s quarterly evaluation of “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), no other changes were identified in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended February
28, 2021 (our fourth fiscal quarter) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
