Company Overview

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company or ADM) unlocks the power of nature to provide access to nutrition worldwide.  The Company is a global leader in sustainable human and animal nutrition, one of the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing companies, and an innovator in creating sustainable solutions in agriculture, energy, and bio-based alternatives to materials and fuels currently produced from petroleum products.  ADM’s breadth, depth, insights, facilities and logistical expertise give the Company unparalleled capabilities to meet needs for food, beverages, health and wellness, and more.  From the seed of the idea to the outcome of the solution, ADM enriches the quality of life the world over.

The Company is one of the world’s leading producers of ingredients for human and animal nutrition, and other products made from nature.  ADM transforms natural products into staple foods, sustainable and renewable industrial products, renewable fuels, and an expansive pantry of food and beverage ingredients and solutions for foods and beverages, supplements, nutrition for pets and livestock and more.  ADM also has significant investments and joint ventures that aim to expand or enhance the market for its products or offer other benefits including, but not limited to, geographic or product-line expansion.  With an array of unparalleled capabilities across every part of the global food chain, ADM gives its customers an edge in solving global challenges of today and tomorrow.  

At ADM, sustainable practices and a focus on environmental responsibility are not separate from its primary business:  they are integral to the growth strategy of the Company and to the work the Company does every day to serve customers and create value for shareholders.  ADM’s board of directors actively oversees the Company’s sustainability strategy through a board-level Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee (Sustainability Committee), and ADM’s Chief Sustainability Officer is part of the core strategy team who reports to the Chief Strategy Officer.  Utilizing ADM’s unique position in the agricultural value chain, its extensive global grain elevator and transportation network, and its production facilities, ADM is driving sustainability into every aspect of the agriculture value chain.  The Company is actively working to improve the efficiency of its facilities and vehicles, finding alternative uses for waste, reusing and recycling water, and sequestering carbon at its onsite capture and storage facility.  ADM works with growers, supporting them with personalized services and innovative technologies; partnering with them to develop and enhance sustainable practices; and transforming their bounty into products for consumers around the globe.  ADM does the same with animal nutrition products.  Today, more people want to feed their pets the same kind of clean, healthy products they eat themselves and consumers expect livestock and poultry to be fed and raised humanely and sustainably.  The Company’s environmental goals, collectively called “Strive 35” – an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce from a 2019 baseline absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 25 percent, reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent, reduce water intensity by 10 percent, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate – are part of an aggressive plan to continue to reduce the Company’s environmental footprint.

From plant-based proteins to probiotics, the Company is growing nutrition trends, working closely with customers to create custom, delicious solutions from nature to meet consumer preferences.  The Company’s innovation and expertise are helping people live healthier lives.  Around the world, ADM’s food scientists, flavorists, and chefs offer innovative solutions for consumers seeking foods, beverages and supplements to support health and wellness.  The Company’s global footprint combines with local insights to give ADM the capabilities few other companies have – ensuring that it gets the very best ingredients from around the globe to its customers, wherever they may be.

Segment Descriptions

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition.

Ag Services and Oilseeds

The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, transportation, and storage of agricultural raw materials, and the crushing and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.  Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the segment include ingredients for food, feed, energy, and industrial customers.  Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” to manufacturers of renewable green diesel and other customers or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils.  Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products.  Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel and glycols or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products.  Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds.  The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment is also a major supplier of peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets.  In North America, cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and other industrial markets.  The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment’s grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network (including barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services) provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations.  The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment also includes agricultural commodity and feed product import, export, and global distribution, and structured trade finance activities.  Structured trade finance’s activities include programs under which ADM prepays financial institutions, on a discounted basis, U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit based on underlying commodity trade flows.  In December 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum Corp. for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel. 

The Company has a 32.2% interest in Pacificor.  Pacificor owns and operates grain export elevators in Kalama, Washington and Portland, Oregon.

Carbohydrate Solutions

The Carbohydrate Solutions segment is engaged in corn and wheat wet and dry milling and other activities. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment converts corn and wheat into products and ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, corn and wheat starches, syrup, glucose, wheat flour, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used by the Carbohydrate Solutions segment as feedstocks in other downstream processes.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Carbohydrate Solutions segment produces alcohol and other food and animal feed ingredients. Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use in products such as hand sanitizers and ethanol for use in gasoline due to its ability to increase octane as an extender and oxygenate. Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients.

Corporate

Corporate includes the results of early-stage start-up companies within ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in 2016.  In addition to identifying companies to invest in, ADM Ventures also works on select high-potential, new product development projects and alternative business models.  Prior to 2020, Corporate also included the Company’s share of the results of its 43.7% equity interest in Compagnie Industrielle et Financiere des Produits Amylaces SA (Luxembourg) and affiliates (CIP), a joint venture that targets investments in food, feed ingredients, and bioproducts businesses, which was sold in December 2019.

Methods of Distribution

The Company’s products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers’ facilities.

The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world.

The Company owns or leases a significant portion of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges, towboats, and ocean-going vessels used to transport the Company’s products to its customers.

Concentration of Revenues by Product

The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods:

Status of New Products

The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products.

Acquisitions, especially in the Nutrition segment, expand the Company’s ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers’ evolving and expanding nutritional needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products.  The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2022. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

A significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities.

In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors.  In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis.

The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.

Some of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks.  For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes.  In addition, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks when not managed appropriately, such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions.  However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices.  ADM has engaged over 13 million acres in sustainable agriculture practices globally.

BUSINESS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Under the stewardship of ADM’s board of directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations.  These policies set the standards that govern the Company’s approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADM’s positions on issues of widespread public interest.  These standards are included in, among others, the Company’s Code of Conduct, Environment, Health, and Safety Policy, Human Rights Policy, Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities, Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms, Statement on Animal Testing, Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance, Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Company’s website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information).

In addition to policies, a portion of the Company’s commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol.  These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria.  ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs.  

The Company aims to achieve full traceability of direct and indirect soy suppliers in South America by the end of 2022 and aims to eliminate all deforestation in its supply chain by the end of 2030.

Trademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property

The Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $841 million as of December 31, 2021.  The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of trademarks, brands, recipes, or other intellectual property. 

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services.

There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements.

Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months.

Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.

No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers.

The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world.

Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.

Competition

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company.

Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.

Research and Development 

Research and development expense during the year ended December
31, 2021, net of reimbursements of government grants, was $171 million.

In November 2021, the Company opened a new animal nutrition laboratory in Rolle, Switzerland to support the development of science-based feed additives to meet worldwide customer needs for pet food, aquaculture, and livestock species.    

ADM Ventures continues to select high-potential, new product development projects in partnership with the business units.  The distribution platform that was launched by the team for ADM to sell several of its ingredients has been successful for revenue growth and market and consumer insights.  ADM Ventures further expanded its equity investments and now has early-stage start-up companies in its portfolio which are focused on developing products for human and animal nutrition, and is looking at several others in which ADM may choose to invest.  These investments also allow for strategic insights as well as collaboration opportunities for which the team is aggressively pursuing.  ADM Ventures portfolio of investments are primarily accounted for at cost and recorded in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products.  Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in fermentation, process chemistry, and catalysis.  The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration.  In September 2021, the Company announced a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with LG Chem, a leading global diversified chemical company, to explore US-based production of lactic acid to meet growing demand for a wide variety of plant-based products, including bioplastics, through the creation of two joint ventures.

In October 2020, the Company announced a long-term agreement with Spiber, Inc. (Spiber) to expand the production of Spiber’s innovative brewed protein polymers for use in apparel and other consumer products.  The Company also announced in 2020 its plans to collaborate with InnovaFeed on the construction and operation of the world’s largest insect protein production site, collocated with ADM’s corn processing complex in Decatur, Illinois.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

The Company knows that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that its commitments to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world.  ADM is committed to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, energy, and packaging materials while pursuing ways to continually improve the Company’s efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental sustainability.  The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) blueprint as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.  ADM focuses its efforts toward goals that align with its business objectives and allow the Company to make the greatest contribution towards the achievement of the SDG, specifically Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land.

Governance 

The Sustainability Committee of the Board actively oversees the Company’s objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility matters.  The Sustainability Committee also oversees the Company’s compliance with sustainability and corporate responsibility laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in ensuring that the Company operates as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect ADM’s reputation.  The Company’s Chief Sustainability Officer works with the Chairman of the Sustainability Committee to set the agendas for the meetings and also attends the meetings.  As for ADM management, the Executive Council of ADM, the Company’s highest strategic and operational body, provides close supervision of the Company’s ESG efforts and an in-depth review of sustainability issues.  Because the Company considers sustainability critical to its strategic planning and mergers and acquisitions efforts, the Chief Sustainability Officer reports to the Chief Strategy Officer and is an important part of the strategy team.  Furthermore, regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate sustainability team, support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive sustainability efforts in the Company’s facilities and supply chains around the world.  ADM’s sustainability efforts are also supported by the Centers of Excellence (CoE) that drive efficiency programs in their areas of focus such as the Utilities CoE, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion CoE, and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) CoE.

Strategy 

The Company aims to mitigate climate change through renewable product and process innovations, supply chain commitments, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of ADM’s production plants throughout its global operations.

ADM believes sustainability is critical to its future growth strategy.  ADM’s strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and technologies in sustainability to help the Company grow and create value for its stakeholders.  Ag Services and Oilseeds is focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working with growers on low carbon agricultural products.  Carbohydrate Solutions is focused on decarbonization as a business, and biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions from agricultural products to replace petroleum-based products.  Nutrition is focused on developing alternative proteins that can reduce the amount of animal-based proteins that are sources of methane and GHG emissions.  The growth of these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 1.5°C threshold indicated by the United Nations. 

Moreover, ADM has a large industrial footprint and believes it is important to reduce GHG emissions related to its business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain.  The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its GHG emissions globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In 2020, ADM announced its environmental stewardship goals, collectively called “Strive 35” – an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25 percent from a 2019 baseline, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent, reduce water intensity by 10 percent, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate.  To support the Company's Strive 35 environmental goals, ADM developed a feasibility study with a leading engineering professional services firm that provides the technology pathway for absolute reduction of GHG by 2035.  The Company has also committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community wellbeing in priority watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by 2025.

In 2021, ADM added 5-year interim targets to ensure the Company stays on track to meet its 2035 goals.  By 2025, the Company aims to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 1.5%, reduce energy intensity and water intensity by 6% and 5%, respectively, and achieve 87% of its waste diverted from landfill. 

In 2021, ADM announced its Scope 3 GHG reduction goal, focused upon the five most material Scope 3 categories for the Company: purchased goods and services; fuel and energy related emissions; upstream transportation and distribution; waste; and processing of solid products/goods.  ADM aims to reduce its absolute Scope 3 emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline by 2035.

The Company anticipates spending between $170
million to $300
million on capital projects to achieve the Strive 35 targets.  In 2021, $15
million was spent on projects in support of these goals.

During the year ended December
31, 2021, the Company spent $57 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. 

ADM’s corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns the Company’s corporate giving with its business strategies and sustainability objectives.  Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress.  The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support education, food security and hunger relief, or safe, responsible, and environmentally sound agricultural practices in critical growing regions around the world.

Metrics and Targets

Metrics and targets are available in ADM's Corporate Sustainability Report which can be accessed through its website at http://www.adm.com.

Scenario Analysis

In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures, ADM conducted an analysis using three scenarios: 1.5°C (based on IPCC SSP1), 2°C (based on IEA WEO 450 Scenario), and 2.6°C (based on IEA INDC Scenario).  The first scenario assumes a rapid transition to a low carbon world in the next decade, limiting temperature increase to 1.5°C.  This involves a high degree of transformation across the economy.  Under this scenario, the worst anticipated physical impacts of climate change are avoided.  The second scenario involves ambitious actions to mitigate climate change, limiting temperature increase to 2°C.  This scenario requires greater policy action; however, there is still an increase in physical climate-related impacts.  The third scenario is based on the current status quo with no changes to policies or actions and an anticipated increase in global temperature by 2.6°C resulting in increased physical impacts of climate change.  ADM used these scenarios as written by the sources, except in the case of the third, status quo scenario, where transition risks were evaluated based on the Company’s existing commitments:  Strive 35.

11

[TABLE]

Item 1.

BUSINESS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

In each of the scenarios, the Company identified potential sourcing shifts and limitations, operational changes, physical impacts, and opportunities.  The primary risks identified fall into two categories:  physical and transition.

Key opportunities are related to products and services offerings.

[TABLE]

Physical Risks

• Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could lead to increased direct costs from the disruption of supply chains and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner. • Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and floods could lead to increased sourcing costs due to limited availability of agricultural commodities and impact ADM’s ability to produce goods, which would directly affect revenues.

Transition Risks

• Emerging regulation and carbon pricing mechanisms could result in increased operational costs and/or tax liabilities in the short to medium term.

• Market demand has a direct effect on production, as well as sustainable sourcing initiatives. Changes in consumer demands could result in additional cost of implementation that may not be overcome by product sales.

• ADM uses coal-fired cogeneration technology to meet a sizeable portion of its energy demand.  The Company is working to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations and making capital investments in its facilities and new technologies.

Products and Services Opportunities

• Development and expansion of low-emission goods and services could lead to increased revenues resulting from increased demand.  As various renewable fuel standards are implemented around the world, ADM has an opportunity to capitalize on the increased demand through the production and sale of ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable green diesel.

• As more businesses and consumers look to renewable products, development of new products or services could lead to increased revenues through access to new and emerging markets.

[/TABLE]

The Company reviewed the results of the scenario analysis with a cross-functional team of individuals from finance, strategy, sustainability, operations, legal, and risk management.  As part of the Company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process, the risks identified from the scenario analysis have been reviewed by the ERM team for mitigation actions. 

Human Capital and Diversity and Inclusion

ADM’s purpose of unlocking the power of nature to enrich the quality of life highlights the significant role ADM plays within an essential industry and the critical job each employee has within the Company.

ADM has long maintained its Code of Conduct to help the Company achieve the right results, the right way.  The code establishes high standards of honesty and integrity for all ADM colleagues and business partners and sets forth specific policies to help ensure that the Company always conducts business fairly and ethically everywhere it operates.

The Company’s culture is focused on Integrity, Performance, Innovation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  ADM is a truly global company of approximately 41,000 employees working together to achieve extraordinary results.  Talented colleagues can be found in a wide variety of roles – from front-line production workers, supply chain experts who deliver to customers all over the world, engineering teams who continuously improve the Company's operations, sales and commercial teams who work closely with customers, finance professionals, and so many more.  ADM continues to develop its workforce to remain relevant and deliver on the Company’s growth aspirations with a strong focus on sustainability.

Part of ADM’s vision is to promote a diverse workplace with equitable opportunities for all its employees within an inclusive culture to make sure all colleagues globally feel they belong and make meaningful contributions to the success of each other and the Company.  ADM brings together colleagues with many different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences.  These global teams drive innovative thinking, creating growth opportunities through diversity of thought.  The Company’s comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) strategy includes four focus areas:  Leadership Engagement & Communication, Recruitment, Advancement & Retention, and Networks & Sponsorships.  In order to ensure that the Company’s global DE&I strategy aligns with its business strategy, ADM reinstalled a global DE&I council with strong presence in four regions of the world.  ADM has made a commitment through Paradigm for Parity® to achieve gender parity in its senior leadership team by 2030.    Since making this commitment in 2018, the Company has improved its gender diversity from 21% to currently 26%.  ADM is proud of its achievements to date, and the Company will continue to strengthen diversity within middle management and entry-level hiring so the progress at the senior leadership level is sustainable over the long-term.  This is a key cultural strategic priority that will continue to strengthen our ability to innovate and drive profitable growth.  At the industry level, ADM has been a key partner in the establishment of Together We Grow, a consortium of agricultural industry leaders united in a shared belief that American agriculture’s best days are yet to come.  Emphasizing diversity and inclusion, Together We Grow works to build a modern workforce with the skills, experience, and capabilities needed to keep pace with the growing world.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has worked hard to recommend nominees who have skills and experiences relevant to ADM’s strategy and operations and who reflect the diversity of the world around us.  As of December 31, 2021, 58% of ADM’s twelve board members are diverse – six are African-American, Hispanic or Asian, and three are women.  Detailed information with respect to the Board’s composition is set forth in “Proxy Summary– Director Nominee Diversity, Age, Tenure, and Independence” of the definitive proxy statement for the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders to be filed on or before April 30, 2022 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Global Operations Risks

Human capital requirements may not be sufficient to effectively support global operations. 

ADM’s global operations function with trained individuals necessary for the processing, warehousing, and shipping of raw materials for products used in other areas of manufacturing or sold as inputs or products to third-party customers.  The availability of skilled trade and production workers has been a specific focus for the United States manufacturing industry.  The pandemic has put further strain on manufacturing labor amid fears of the pandemic, childcare challenges, along with the re-allocation friction resulting in some of the workforce shifts from manufacturing positions. The Company has various methods and tactics to mitigate potential shortfalls.  The inability to properly staff manufacturing facilities with skilled trades and hourly labor due to a limited number of qualified resources could negatively impact operations.

The Company’s information technology (IT) systems, processes, and sites may suffer cyber security breaches, interruptions, or failures which may affect the Company’s ability to conduct its business.

The Company’s operations rely on certain key IT systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, to provide critical data connectivity, information, and services for internal and external users.

These interactions include, but are not limited to: ordering and managing materials from suppliers; risk management activities; converting raw materials to finished products; inventory management; shipping products to customers; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting financial results of operations; human resources benefits and payroll management; and complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements.

The Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and integrating it with various third party service providers on a worldwide basis as part of its ongoing business transformation program, which is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment.  This will help the Company in mitigating the risk of instability in aging legacy systems and manual processes.  Increased IT security and social engineering threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company’s third party data.  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data.  Compliance with and interpretation of various data privacy regulations continue to evolve and any violation could subject the Company to legal claims, regulatory penalties, and damage to its reputation.  The Company has put in place security measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber-based attacks, and has instituted control procedures for cybersecurity incident responses and disaster recovery plans for its critical systems.  In addition, the Company monitors this risk on an ongoing basis to detect and correct any breaches, and reports metrics on the quality of the Company’s data security efforts and control environment to the highest level of management and to the Board of Directors.  However, if the Company’s IT systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and the Company’s disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate the risks on a timely basis, the Company may suffer significant interruptions in its ability to manage its operations, loss of valuable data, actual or threatened legal actions, and damage to its reputation, which may adversely impact the Company’s revenues, operating results, and financial condition.

The Company may be impacted by carbon emission regulations in multiple regions throughout the globe.

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China.  In particular, the State of Illinois recently enacted legislation intended to eliminate carbon emissions by 2050.  The Company’s operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs, currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company.  It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements.  Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.  The Company has programs and policies in place to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

The Company faces risks related to health epidemics, pandemics, and similar outbreaks.

While ADM has effectively managed through the risks arising from the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and has implemented mitigation actions across global operations that has had a positive impact on its customers, employees, local communities, and other stakeholders, the Company could be materially impacted in the future if a more severe variant would arise causing disruptions far more severe than the Company has recently experienced.  In such circumstances, ADM may be unable to perform fully on its contractual obligations, critical global supply chain and logistical networks may be affected, and costs and working capital needs may increase.  These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, demand for certain products that ADM produces, particularly biofuels and ingredients that go into food and beverages that support the food services channels, could be materially impacted from a prolonged COVID-19 variant outbreak or significant local resurgences of the virus, leading to additional government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other restrictions.

The Company is exposed to potential business disruption including, but not limited to, disruption of transportation services, disruption in the supply of non-commodity raw materials used in its processing operations, and other impacts resulting from acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters, pandemics, severe weather conditions, accidents, or other planned disruptions, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operations rely on dependable and efficient transportation services the disruption of which could result in difficulties supplying materials to the Company’s facilities and impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner.

The Company relies on access to navigable rivers and waterways in order to fulfill its transportation obligations more effectively.

In addition, if certain non-agricultural commodity raw materials, such as water or certain chemicals used in the Company’s processing operations, are not available, the Company’s business could be disrupted.

Any major lack of available water for use in certain of the Company’s processing operations could have a material adverse impact on operating results.

Certain factors which may impact the availability of non-agricultural commodity raw materials are out of the Company’s control including, but not limited to, disruptions resulting from weather, high or low river water conditions, economic conditions, manufacturing delays or disruptions at suppliers, shortage of materials, interruption of energy supply, and unavailable or poor supplier credit conditions.

The assets and operations of the Company could be subject to extensive property damage and business disruption from various events which include, but are not limited to, acts of terrorism (for example, purposeful adulteration of the Company’s products), war, natural disasters, pandemics, severe weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, or other outages. The Company is continuing to enhance and deploy additional food safety and security procedures and controls to appropriately mitigate the risks of any adulteration of the Company’s products in the supply chain and finished products in production and distribution networks. In addition, the Company conforms to management systems, such as International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or other recognized global standards.

The Company’s risk management strategies may not be effective.

The Company has a Chief Risk Officer who oversees the ERM Program and regularly reports to the Board of Directors on the myriad of risks facing the Company and the Company’s strategies for mitigating those risks.  The Company’s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity cash prices and derivative prices, transportation costs, energy prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity markets.

The Company monitors position limits and counterparty risks and engages in other strategies and controls to manage these risks.  The Company regularly reports its aggregate commodity risk exposures to the Board of Directors through the ERM process.  The Company has an established commodity merchandising governance process that ensures proper position reporting and monitoring, limits approvals, and executes training on trade compliance, commodity regulatory reporting controls, and other policies.  The Company’s risk monitoring efforts may not be successful at detecting a significant risk exposure.

If these controls and strategies are not successful in mitigating the Company’s exposure to these fluctuations, it could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

17

[TABLE]

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Legal Regulations and Compliance Risks

The Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations, and mandates globally which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and forward strategy.

The Company does business globally, connecting crops and markets in over 190 countries, and is required to comply with laws and regulations administered by the United States federal government as well as state, local, and non-U.S. governmental authorities in numerous areas including:  accounting and income taxes, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, global trade, trade sanctions, environmental, product safety, and handling and production of regulated substances.

The Company frequently faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due including questions regarding the timing, amount of deductions, the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, and further risks related to changing tax laws domestically and globally.  Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or appropriately resolve these challenges could subject the Company to administrative, civil, and criminal remedies, including fines, penalties, disgorgement, injunctions, and recalls of its products, and damage to its reputation.

The production of the Company’s products uses materials that can create emissions of certain regulated substances, including GHG emissions.

The Company has programs and policies in place (e.g., Corporate Sustainability Program, Commitment to Protecting Forests, Biodiversity and Communities, Environmental Policy, Strive 35 environmental goals, etc.) to expand responsible practices while reducing its environmental footprint and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations.  Implementation of these programs and policies sometimes requires the acquisition of technology or capital investments at a cost to the Company.  Failure to comply with the laws and regulations can have serious consequences, including civil, administrative, and criminal penalties as well as a negative impact on the Company’s reputation, business, cash flows, and results of operations.

In addition, changes to regulations or implementation of additional regulations - for example, the imposition of regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gases or regulatory modernization of food safety laws - may require the Company to modify existing processing facilities and/or processes which could significantly increase operating costs and adversely affect operating results.

Government policies, mandates, and regulations specifically affecting the agricultural sector and related industries; regulatory policies or matters that affect a variety of businesses; taxation polices; and political instability could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

Agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies, mandates, regulations, and trade agreements, including taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, foreign exchange rates, and import and export restrictions, including policies related to genetically modified organisms, traceability standards, sustainable practices, product safety and labeling, renewable fuels, and low carbon fuel mandates.  These policies can influence the planting of certain crops; the location and size of crop production; whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded; the volume and types of imports and exports; the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials; the viability and volume of production of certain of the Company’s products; and industry profitability.

For example, changes in government policies or regulations of ethanol and biodiesel including, but not limited to, changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard program under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 in the United States, including the treatment of small refinery exemptions, can have an impact on the Company’s operating results.

International trade regulations can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.  Regulations of financial markets and instruments, including the Dodd-Frank Act, Consumer Protection Act, and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, create uncertainty and may lead to additional risks and costs, and could adversely affect the Company’s futures commission merchant business and its agricultural commodity risk management practices.  Future government policies may adversely affect the supply of, demand for, and prices of the Company’s products; adversely affect the Company’s ability to deploy adequate hedging programs; restrict the Company’s ability to do business in its existing and target markets; and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results.

18

[TABLE]

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

The Company’s operating results could be affected by political instability and by changes in monetary, fiscal, trade, and environmental policies, laws, regulations, and acquisition approvals, creating risks including, but not limited to: changes in a country’s or region’s economic or political conditions, local labor conditions and regulations, and safety and environmental regulations; reduced protection of intellectual property rights; changes in the regulatory or legal environment; restrictions on currency exchange activities; currency exchange fluctuations; burdensome taxes and tariffs; enforceability of legal agreements and judgments; adverse tax, administrative agency or judicial outcomes; and regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases.

International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit the Company’s ability to transact business in these markets.  The Company has historically benefited from the free flow of agricultural and food and feed ingredient products from the U.S. and other sources to markets around the world.  Increases in tariff and restrictive trade activities around the world (e.g., the U.S.-China trade relations dispute, Iran sanctions) could negatively impact the Company’s ability to enter certain markets or the price of products may become less competitive in those markets.

The Company’s strategy involves expanding the volume and diversity of crops it merchandises and processes, expanding the global reach of its core model, expanding its value-added product portfolio, and expanding the sustainable agriculture programs and partnerships it participates in.  Government policies including, but not limited to, antitrust and competition law, trade restrictions, food safety regulations, sustainability requirements, and traceability, can impact the Company’s ability to execute this strategy successfully.

Credit and Liquidity Risk - 

The Company’s business is capital-intensive in nature and the Company relies on cash generated from its operations and external financing to fund its growth and ongoing capital needs.
 Limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company requires significant capital, including continuing access to credit markets, to operate its current business and fund its growth strategy.
 The Company’s working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.

The Company also requires substantial capital to maintain and upgrade its extensive network of storage facilities, processing plants, refineries, mills, ports, transportation assets, and other facilities to keep pace with competitive developments, technological advances, regulations, and changing safety standards in the industry.
 Moreover, the expansion of the Company’s business and pursuit of acquisitions or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital.

Access to credit markets and pricing of the Company’s capital is dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies.

Sufficient credit ratings allow the Company to access cost competitive tier one commercial paper markets.  If the Company is unable to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings, access to these commercial paper and other debt markets and costs of borrowings could be adversely affected.

If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or maintain access to adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, it could restrict the Company’s current operations and its growth opportunities.  The Company manages this risk with constant monitoring of credit/liquidity metrics, cash forecasting, and routine communications with credit rating agencies regarding risk management practices.  

LIBOR (London Interbank Offered rate) has been the subject of recent proposals for international reform and it is anticipated LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by June 2023.  The Company’s variable rate debt, credit facilities, certain derivative agreements, and commercial agreements may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates.  Although the Company does not expect that a transition from LIBOR will have a material adverse impact on its financing costs, the Company continues to monitor developments.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Business Environment and Competition Risks

The availability and prices of the agricultural commodities and agricultural commodity products the Company procures, transports, stores, processes, and merchandises can be affected by climate change, weather conditions, disease, government programs, competition, and various other factors beyond the Company’s control and could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations, including impacts from factors outside the Company’s control such as changes in weather conditions, climate change, rising sea levels, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, and changes in global demand, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company uses a global network of procurement, processing, and transportation assets, as well as robust communications between global commodity merchandiser teams, to continually assess price and basis opportunities.  Management-established limits (including a corporate wide value-at-risk metric), with robust internal reporting, help to manage risks in pursuit of driving performance.  Additionally, the Company depends globally on agricultural producers to ensure an adequate supply of the agricultural commodities.

Reduced supply of agricultural commodities could adversely affect the Company’s profitability by increasing the cost of raw materials and/or limiting the Company’s ability to procure, transport, store, process, and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner.  High and volatile commodity prices can place more pressures on short-term working capital funding.  Conversely, if supplies are abundant and crop production globally outpaces demand for more than one or two crop cycles, price volatility is somewhat diminished.  This could result in reduced operating results due to the lack of supply chain dislocations and reduced market spread and basis opportunities.  

The Company has certain finished products, such as ethanol and biodiesel, which are closely related to, or may be substituted for, petroleum products, or in the case of ethanol, blended into gasoline to increase octane content.  Therefore, the selling prices of ethanol and biodiesel can be impacted by the selling prices of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other octane enhancers.

A significant decrease in the price of gasoline, diesel fuel, or other octane enhancers could result in a significant decrease in the selling price of the Company’s ethanol and biodiesel.  The Company uses derivative contracts as anticipatory hedges for both purchases of commodity inputs and sales of energy-based products in order to protect itself in the near term against these price trends and to protect and maximize processing margins. 

Advances in technology, such as seed and crop protection, farming techniques, storage and logistics, and speed of information flow, may reduce the significance of dislocations and arbitrage opportunities in the agricultural global markets, which may reduce the earnings potential of agricultural merchandisers and processors.  

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates.

The Company faces significant competition in each of its businesses and has numerous competitors, who can be different depending upon each of the business segments in which it participates.

The Company competes for the acquisition of inputs such as raw materials, transportation services, and other materials and supplies, as well as for workforce and talent.  Competition impacts the Company’s ability to generate and increase its gross profit as a result of the following factors:

Pricing of the Company’s products is partly dependent upon industry processing capacity, which is impacted by competitor actions to bring idled capacity on-line, build new production capacity or execute aggressive consolidation; many of the products bought and sold by the Company are global commodities or are derived from global commodities that are highly price competitive and, in many cases, subject to substitution; significant changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, particularly the currencies of major crop growing countries, could also make goods and products of these countries more competitive than U.S. products; improved yields in different crop growing regions may reduce the reliance on origination territories in which the Company has a significant presence; and continued merger and acquisition activities resulting in further consolidations could result in greater cost competitiveness and global scale of certain players in the industry, especially when acquirers are state-owned and/or backed by public funds and have profit and return objectives that may differ from publicly traded enterprises.  To compete effectively, the Company focuses on safely improving efficiency in its production and distribution operations, developing and maintaining appropriate market presence, maintaining a high level of product safety and quality, supporting socially responsible and sustainable practices, promoting environmental responsibility, and working with customers to develop new products and tailored solutions.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

In the case of the nutrition business, while maintaining efficient and cost-effective operations are important, the ability to drive innovation and develop quality nutritional and wellness solutions for human and animal needs are key factors to remain competitive in the nutrition market.

Fluctuations in energy prices could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company’s operating costs and the selling prices of certain finished products are sensitive to changes in energy prices.

The Company’s processing plants are powered principally by electricity, natural gas, and coal.

The Company’s transportation operations are dependent upon diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.

Significant increases in the cost of these items, including any consequences of regulation or taxation of greenhouse gases, could adversely affect the Company’s production costs and operating results.  The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its energy intensity globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The Company is subject to economic downturns and regional economic volatilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company conducts its business and has substantial assets located in many countries and geographic areas. While 62 percent of the Company’s long-lived assets are located in the United States, the Company also has significant operations in both developed areas (such as Western Europe, Canada, and Brazil) and emerging market areas.  One of the Company’s strategies is to expand the global reach of its core model, which may include expanding or developing its business in emerging market areas.  Both developed and emerging market areas are subject to impacts of economic downturns, including decreased demand for the Company’s products, and reduced availability of credit, or declining credit quality of the Company’s suppliers, customers, and other counterparties.  In addition, emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile operating conditions including, but not limited to, logistics limitations or delays, labor-related challenges, epidemic outbreaks and economic recovery, limitations or regulations affecting trade flows, local currency concerns, and other economic and political instability.

Political fiscal instability could generate intrusive regulations in emerging markets, potentially creating unanticipated assessments of taxes, fees, increased risks of corruption, etc.  Economic downturns and volatile market conditions could adversely affect the Company’s operating results and ability to execute its long-term business strategies, although the nature of many of the Company’s products (i.e. food and feed ingredients) is less sensitive to demand reductions in any economic downcycles.  The Company mitigates this risk in many ways, including country risk and exposure analysis, government relations and tax compliance activities, and robust ethics compliance training requirements. 

The Company may fail to realize the benefits of or experience delays in the execution of its growth strategy, which encompasses organic and inorganic initiatives, including those outside the U.S. and in businesses where the Company does not currently have a large presence.

As the Company executes its growth strategy, through both organic and inorganic growth, it may encounter risks which could result in increased costs, decreased revenues, and delayed synergies.  Growth in new geographies outside the U.S. can expose the Company to volatile economic, political, and regulatory risks that may negatively impact its operations and ability to achieve its growth strategy.  Expanding businesses where the Company has limited presence may expose the Company to risks related to the inability to identify an appropriate partner or target and favorable terms, inability to retain/hire strategic talent, or integration risks that may require significant management resources that would have otherwise been available for ongoing growth or operational initiatives.  Acquisitions may involve unanticipated delays, costs, and other problems.  Due diligence performed prior to an acquisition may not identify a material liability or issue that could impact the Company's reputation or adversely affect results of operations resulting in a reduction of the anticipated acquisition benefits.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve integration risks such as: internal control effectiveness, system integration risks, the risk of impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangibles, ability to retain acquired employees, and other unanticipated risks.

[TABLE]

Item 1A.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results.

The Company is subject to industry-specific risks which include, but are not limited to, product safety and quality; launch of new products by other industries that can replace the functionalities of the Company’s production; shifting consumer preferences; federal, state, and local regulations on manufacturing or labeling; socially acceptable and sustainable farming practices; environmental, health, and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims.

The liability which could result from certain of these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed liability insurance related to product liability and food safety matters maintained by the Company.

The Company has a particularly strong capability and culture around occupational health and safety and food safety; however, risks to the Company’s reputation may exist due to potential negative publicity caused by product liability, food safety, occupational health and safety, workforce diversity, and environmental matters.

Certain of the Company’s merchandised commodities and finished products are used as ingredients in livestock and poultry feed.

The Company is subject to risks associated with economic, product quality, feed safety or other factors which may adversely affect the livestock and poultry businesses, including the outbreak of disease in livestock and poultry, for example African swine fever, which could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products used as ingredients in feed.

In addition, as the Company increases its investment in flavors and ingredients businesses, it is exposed to increased risks related to rapidly changing consumer preferences and the impacts these changes could have on the success of certain of the Company's customers.

The Company has limited control over and may not realize the expected benefits of its equity investments and joint ventures and may not be able to monetize the investments at an attractive value when the Company decides to exit the investments.

The Company has $5.3 billion invested in or advanced to joint ventures and investments over which the Company has limited control as to governance and management activities.

Net sales to unconsolidated affiliates during the year ended December
31, 2021 were $6.6 billion.

Risks related to these investments may include:  the financial strength of the investment partner; loss of revenues and cash flows to the investment partner and related gross profit; the inability to implement beneficial management strategies, including risk management and compliance monitoring, with respect to the investment’s activities; and the risk that the Company may not be able to resolve disputes with the partners.

The Company may encounter unanticipated operating issues, financial results, or compliance and reputational risks related to these investments.  The Company mitigates this risk using controls and policies related to joint venture formation, governance (including board of directors’ representation), merger and acquisition integration management, and harmonization of joint venture policies with the Company’s policies and controls.

PROPERTIES

[/TABLE]

The Company’s operations are such that most products are efficiently processed near the source of raw materials.

Consequently, the Company has many plants strategically located in agricultural commodity producing areas.

The annual volume of commodities processed will vary depending upon availability of raw materials and demand for finished products.  The Company also owns approximately 160 warehouses and terminals primarily used as bulk storage facilities and has 59 innovation centers.  Processing plants and procurement facilities owned or leased by unconsolidated joint ventures are not included in the tables below.

To enhance the efficiency of transporting large quantities of raw materials and finished products between the Company’s procurement facilities and processing plants and also the final delivery of products to its customers around the world, the Company owns approximately 1,800 barges, 11,300 rail cars, 310 trucks, 1,300 trailers, 120 boats, and 3 oceangoing vessels; and leases, under operating leases, approximately 780 barges, 17,500 rail cars, 290 trucks, 370 trailers, 30 boats, and 28 oceangoing vessels.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

[/TABLE]

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 in Item 8 for information on income tax matters), and class actions.  The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of its business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution.  The outcomes of these matters are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued.  If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.  See Note 20 in Item 8 for information on the Company’s legal proceedings.

The next phase of the Company’s strategic transformation is focused on two strategic pillars: Productivity and Innovation.

The Productivity pillar includes (1) advancing the roles of the Company’s Centers of Excellence in procurement, supply chain, and operations to deliver additional efficiencies across the enterprise; (2) continued roll out of the 1ADM business transformation program and implementation of improved standardized business processes; and (3) increased use of technology, analytics, and automation at production facilities, in offices, and with customers.

Innovation activities include expansions and investments in (1) improving the customer experience, including leveraging producer relationships and enhancing the use of state-of-the-art digital technology to help customers grow; (2) sustainability-driven innovation, which encompasses the full range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to serve customers’ needs; and (3) growth initiatives, including organic growth to support additional capacity and meet growing demand, and mergers and acquisitions opportunities.

ADM will support both pillars with investments in technology, which include expanding digital capabilities and investing further in product research and development. All of these efforts will continue to be strengthened by the Company’s ongoing commitment to Readiness.

Operating Performance Indicators

The Company’s Ag Services and Oilseeds operations are principally agricultural commodity-based businesses where changes in selling prices move in relationship to changes in prices of the commodity-based agricultural raw materials.  As a result, changes in agricultural commodity prices have relatively equal impacts on both revenues and cost of products sold.  Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses do not necessarily correspond to the changes in margins or gross profit.  Thus, gross margins per volume or metric ton are more meaningful than gross margins as percentage of revenues.

The Company’s Carbohydrate Solutions operations and Nutrition businesses also utilize agricultural commodities (or products derived from agricultural commodities) as raw materials.  However, in these operations, agricultural commodity market price changes do not necessarily correlate to changes in cost of products sold.  Therefore, changes in revenues of these businesses may correspond to changes in margins or gross profit.  Thus, gross margin rates are more meaningful as a performance indicator in these businesses.

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries.

For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency.  Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates for the applicable periods.  For the majority of the Company’s business activities in Brazil and Argentina, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, certain transactions, including taxes, occur in local currency and require remeasurement to the functional currency.  Changes in revenues are expected to be correlated to changes in expenses reported by the Company caused by fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

The Company measures its performance using key financial metrics including net earnings, gross margins, segment operating profit, return on invested capital, earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), economic value added, manufacturing expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses.  The Company’s financial results can vary significantly due to changes in factors such as fluctuations in energy prices, weather conditions, crop plantings, government programs and policies, trade policies, changes in global demand, general global economic conditions, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.  Due to these unpredictable factors, the Company undertakes no responsibility for updating any forward-looking information contained within “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

This section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December  31, 2020.

Market Factors Influencing Operations or Results in the Twelve Months Ended December
31, 2021 

The Company is subject to a variety of market factors which affect the Company's operating results.  In Ag Services and Oilseeds, North American origination volumes benefited from strong export demand throughout the year while South American origination volumes were impacted by a delayed harvest and low farmer selling activity. Crushing margins benefited from strong demand and tight soybean and canola/rapeseed stocks.  Demand for refined oils was strong, driven by the regional lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S. and demand for renewable green diesel.  In Carbohydrate Solutions, margins in starches and sweeteners were solid despite softer sweetener demand early in the year due to continued COVID-19 restrictions.  Starch demand continued to be robust.  Co-product prices were strong.  Ethanol demand returned closer to pre-pandemic levels.  For most of year, ethanol margins were volatile initially supported by improving domestic demand, then challenged in the summer months prior to harvest due to limited availability of corn.  Ethanol inventory levels were at a five-year low for the majority of the fourth quarter due to strong domestic demand and some supply chain bottlenecks resulting in elevated margins for the industry late in the year.  Nutrition benefited from overall strong demand in various product categories.  In Human Nutrition, demand for flavors, flavor systems, specialty proteins, bioactives, and fibers were strong.  In Animal Nutrition, weak demand and higher input costs as a result of COVID-19 in South America and Asia were partially offset by the growing demand in complete food for petfood.  Amino acids pricing and margins improved due to a tighter global supply environment.

Year Ended December
31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December
31, 2020

Net earnings attributable to controlling interests increased 53% or $0.9 billion, to $2.7 billion.   Segment operating profit increased 34% or $1.2 billion, to $4.6 billion, and included a net charge of $136 million consisting of asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges of $213 million, partially offset by gains on the sale of certain assets of $77 million.  Included in segment operating profit in the prior year was net income of $7 million consisting of gains on the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Wilmar and certain other assets, partially offset by asset impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges.  Adjusted segment operating profit increased $1.3 billion to $4.8 billion due primarily to higher results in most businesses except in Ag Services and Other Business.  Corporate results in the current year were a net charge of $1.3 billion and included a pension settlement charge of $83
million, loss on debt extinguishment of $36 million, a mark-to-market gain of $19 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020, acquisition-related expenses of $7 million, and a restructuring charge of $4
million.  Corporate results in the prior year were a net charge of $1.6 billion and included early debt retirement charges of $409 million, a mark-to-market loss of $17 million on the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020, impairment and restructuring charges of $16 million, acquisition-related expenses of $4 million, gains on the sale of certain assets of $7 million, and a credit of $91 million from the elimination of the last-in, first-out (LIFO) reserve in connection with the accounting change effective January 1, 2020.

Income taxes of $578 million increased $477 million.  The Company’s effective tax rate for 2021 was 17.4% compared to 5.4% for 2020

.

  The increase in rate for 2021 was due primarily to changes in the geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, including valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments.  The 2020 tax rate also included the impact of U.S. tax credits signed into law in December 2019, including a $73
million discrete tax benefit related to 45G railroad tax credits recognized in the quarter ended March 31, 2020.  The 45G railroad tax credits had an offsetting impact in cost of products sold.

Analysis of Statements of Earnings

Processed volumes by product for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows (in metric tons):

The Company generally operates its production facilities, on an overall basis, at or near capacity, adjusting facilities individually, as needed, to react to the current margin environment and seasonal local supply and demand conditions.  The overall decrease in oilseeds processed volumes was due to cold weather and natural gas curtailments in North America, delays in soybean harvest in South America, and some production challenges in certain North American oilseeds processing plants.  The overall increase in corn processed volumes was primarily related to the idling of two dry mill facilities in the second quarter of 2020.  The Company restarted these idled facilities in April 2021. 

Revenues by segment for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

Revenues and cost of products sold in agricultural merchandising and processing businesses are significantly correlated to the underlying commodity prices and volumes.  In periods of significant changes in market prices, the underlying performance of the Company is better evaluated by looking at margins since both revenues and cost of products sold, particularly in Ag Services and Oilseeds, generally have a relatively equal impact from market price changes which generally result in an insignificant impact to gross profit.  

30

[TABLE]

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Revenues increased $20.9 billion to $85.2 billion due to higher sales prices ($21.0 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes ($0.1 billion).  Higher sales prices of oils, soybeans, corn, meal, animal feed, alcohol, biodiesel, wheat, and flavors and higher sales volumes of wheat and processed cotton, were partially offset by lower sales volumes of soybeans and oils.  Ag Services and Oilseeds revenues increased 35% to $67.0 billion due to higher sales prices ($17.3 billion).  Carbohydrate Solutions revenues increased 31% to $11.1 billion due to higher sales prices ($2.6
billion).  Nutrition revenues increased 16% to $6.7 billion due to higher sales prices ($1.0 billion), partially offset by lower sales volumes of ($0.1
billion).

Cost of products sold increased $19.4 billion to $79.3 billion due principally to higher average commodity costs.  Included in cost of products sold in the prior year was a credit of $91 million from the effect of the elimination of the LIFO reserve in connection with the accounting change effective January 1, 2020.  Manufacturing expenses increased $0.5 billion to $6.1 billion due principally to higher maintenance and energy costs and salaries and benefits, partially offset by lower railroad maintenance expenses.

Foreign currency translation impacts increased revenues by $0.9
billion and cost of products sold by $0.8 billion.

Gross profit increased $1.5 billion or 34%, to $6.0 billion due to higher results in Ag Services and Oilseeds ($737
million), Carbohydrate Solutions ($577
million), Nutrition ($199
million), and Other ($47
million).  These factors are explained in the segment operating profit discussion on page 33.  In Corporate, the elimination of the LIFO reserve in connection with the accounting change effective January 1, 2020 had a positive impact on gross profit of $91
million in the prior year.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 11% to $3.0 billion due principally to higher salaries and benefits, performance-based compensation accruals, IT expenses, and a legal settlement.

Asset impairment, exit, and restructuring costs increased $84 million to $164 million.  Charges in the current year consisted of $125
million of impairments related to certain long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and $35
million of restructuring charges, presented as specified items within segment operating profit, and $4
million of restructuring charges in Corporate.  Charges in the prior year consisted primarily of $47
million of impairments related to certain intangible and other long-lived assets and $17
million of individually insignificant restructuring charges presented as specified items within segment operating profit, $7
million of individually insignificant impairments and $9
million of individually insignificant restructuring charges in Corporate.  

Interest expense decreased $74 million to $265 million due to lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year.  Interest expense in the current year also included a $19 million mark-to-market gain adjustment related to the conversion option of the Wilmar exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020 compared to a $17
million mark-to-market loss adjustment in the prior period. 

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $16 million to $595 million due to higher earnings from the Company’s investment in Stratas Foods LLC, partially offset by lower earnings from the Company’s investments in SoyVen, Hungrana Ltd., and Almidones Mexicanos S.A.    

Loss on debt extinguishment in the current year of $36 million was related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025.  Loss on debt extinguishment of $409
million in the prior year related to multiple early debt redemptions including the $0.7
billion debt tender in September 2020.

Investment income decreased $15 million to $96 million due to lower interest rates on segregated funds in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business and lower interest earned on financing receivables, partially offset by a $49
million investment revaluation gain in the current year compared to a $23
million investment revaluation gain in the prior year.

Other income - net of $94 million decreased $161 million.  Current year income included gains on the sale of certain ethanol and other assets and disposals of individually insignificant assets in the ordinary course of business, foreign exchange gains, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, and other income, partially offset by a non-cash pension settlement charge related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Company’s ADM Retirement Plant and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees.  Prior year income included gains related to the sale of a portion of the Company’s shares in Wilmar and certain other assets, the non-service components of net pension benefit income, foreign exchange gains, and other income.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Ag Services and Oilseeds operating profit increased 32%.  Ag Services results were lower than the prior year.  In North America, strong Chinese demand and favorable positions in a dynamic pricing environment delivered significantly higher results.  South American origination results were significantly lower due to decreased farmer selling activity versus the prior year and the effects from a slightly delayed harvest and higher freight costs.  Global Trade results were impacted by lower margins in structured trade finance and negative timing effects related to ocean freight positions which are expected to reverse in the coming quarters.  Crushing results were significantly higher.  In North America and Europe, tight supplies and strong demand that drove higher crush margins were partially offset by results in South America which were impacted by slower farmer selling and higher cost of beans.  Refined Products and Other results were higher year-over-year on stronger margins in North America and Europe, Middle East, Africa, and India (EMEAI), partially offset by impacts related to the reduction in Brazilian biodiesel mandates.  Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher versus the prior year.

Carbohydrate Solutions operating profit increased 79%.  Starches and Sweeteners results, including ethanol production from the wet mills, were significantly higher than the prior year.  The business capitalized on rising prices in the ethanol complex and favorable co-product values in an industry environment of improving margins, falling inventories, and higher input costs.  Corn oil results significantly improved from the prior year, which had been impacted by significant mark-to-market effects.  Current year results benefited from strong risk management gains that enhanced margins and trading opportunities.  Demand for flour by the foodservice sector remained below the prior year.  Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially higher, driven by improved margins on the distribution of fuel ethanol and strong performance in USP-grade alcohol and the resumption of production at the two dry mills.

Nutrition operating profit increased 20%.  Human Nutrition results were higher than the prior year.  Flavors results were up, driven by strong sales across various market segments.  In North America and EMEAI, the flavors business delivered strong volumes and improved product mix, particularly in the beverage segment.  Specialty Ingredients delivered sales growth in specialty proteins and improved pricing and product mix, though results were negatively impacted by the effects of higher production costs, normalization of prices in the wholesale ingredients business, and COVID-related shifts in demand across the portfolio.  Health and Wellness results were strong, with robust demand driving strong results in probiotics and fibers.  Animal Nutrition results were higher on favorable results in amino acids, driven by improved margins and product mix, partially offset by lower demand and higher input costs as a result of pandemic effects in South America and Asia.

Other Business operating profit decreased 52% primarily due to lower underwriting results from the captive insurance operations, most of which were offset by corresponding recoveries in other business segments.

Corporate results are as follows:

[TABLE]

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Corporate results were a net charge of $1.3 billion in the current year compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year.  The elimination of the LIFO reserve in connection with the accounting change effective January 1, 2020 resulted in a credit of $91 million in the prior year.  Interest expense-net decreased $36 million due principally to lower interest rates and the favorable liability management actions taken in the prior year.  Unallocated corporate costs increased $100 million due primarily to higher variable performance-related compensation expense accruals, the continued cost centralization in procurement, supply chain, and operations, and additional investments in IT and related projects.  Loss on debt extinguishment in the current year  related to the early redemption of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due in March 2025.  Loss on debt extinguishment in the prior year related to multiple early debt redemptions.  Gain (loss) on debt conversion option was related to the mark-to-market adjustment of the conversion option of the exchangeable bonds issued in August 2020.  Impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in the current year included a non-cash pension settlement charge of $83
million related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that irrevocably transferred the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for certain salaried and hourly retirees and terminated vested participants under the Company’s ADM Retirement Plan and ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees to independent third parties, and individually insignificant restructuring charges.  Impairment, restructuring, and settlement charges in the prior year were related to impairment of certain assets and individually insignificant restructuring charges.  Other charges in the current year included railroad maintenance expenses of $67
million partially offset by the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $16
million and an investment revaluation gain of $49
million.  Other charges in the prior year included railroad maintenance expenses of $138
million, partially offset by foreign exchange gains, an investment revaluation gain of $23
million, and the non-service components of net pension benefit income of $33
million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses adjusted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit, non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC, to evaluate the Company’s financial performance.  These performance measures are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures.  

Adjusted EPS is defined as diluted EPS adjusted for the effects on reported diluted EPS of specified items.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for specified items.  The Company calculates adjusted EBITDA by removing the impact of specified items and adding back the amounts of interest expense and depreciation and amortization to earnings before income taxes.  Adjusted segment operating profit is segment operating profit adjusted, where applicable, for specified items.  

Management believes that adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of the Company’s performance because they provide investors additional information about the Company’s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability.  Adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted segment operating profit are not intended to replace or be an alternative to diluted EPS, earnings before income taxes, and segment operating profit, respectively, the most directly comparable amounts reported under GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

A Company objective is to have sufficient liquidity, balance sheet strength, and financial flexibility to fund the operating and capital requirements of a capital intensive agricultural commodity-based business.

The Company depends on access to credit markets, which can be impacted by its credit rating and factors outside of ADM’s control, to fund its working capital needs and capital expenditures.  The primary source of funds to finance ADM’s operations, capital expenditures, and advancement of its growth strategy is cash generated by operations and lines of credit, including a commercial paper borrowing facility and accounts receivable securitization programs.

In addition, the Company believes it has access to funds from public and private equity and debt capital markets in both U.S. and international markets.

Cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 billion in 2021 compared to a use of $2.4 billion in 2020.  Working capital changes as described below increased cash by $2.7 billion in the current year compared to a decrease of $5.5 billion in the prior year which included the impact of deferred consideration.  During 2020, the Company restructured its accounts receivable securitization programs from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure.  As a result, operating cash flows in the current year no longer include the impact of deferred consideration in securitized receivables which decreased operating cash flows in previous years.

Trade receivables increased $0.6 billion primarily due to higher revenues.  Inventories increased $2.8
billion primarily due to higher inventory prices and, to a lesser extent, higher volumes.  Other current assets decreased $1.3 billion primarily due to decreases in contracts and futures gains.  Trade payables increased $1.9
billion due principally to increased grain purchases.  Payables to brokerage customers increased $2.5 billion due to increased customer trading activity in the Company’s futures commission and brokerage business.

Deferred consideration in securitized receivables of $4.6 billion in 2020 was offset by the same amount of net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables.  

Cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion this year compared to cash provided of $4.5 billion last year.  Capital expenditures in the current year were $1.2
billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year.  Net assets of businesses acquired were $1.6
billion this year compared to $15 million last year primarily due to the acquisitions of P4, Sojaprotein, and Deerland in 2021.  Proceeds from sales of businesses and assets of $0.2
billion in the current year related to the sale of the ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois and certain other assets compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year which related to the sale of a portion of the Company shares in Wilmar and certain other assets.  Net consideration received for beneficial interest obtained for selling trade receivables was $4.6 billion in 2020.

Cash used in financing activities was $1.1 billion this year compared to $0.4 billion last year.  Long-term debt borrowings in the current year of $1.3 billion consisted of the $750
million aggregate principal amount of 2.700% Notes due 2051 issued on September 10, 2021 and the €0.5
billion aggregate principal amount of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2022 issued in a private placement on March 25, 2021.  Long-term debt borrowings in the prior year of $1.8 billion consisted of $0.5
billion and $1.0
billion aggregate principal amounts of 2.75% Notes due in 2025 and 3.25% Notes due in 2030, respectively, issued on March 27, 2020 and the $0.3
billion aggregate principal amount of zero coupon exchangeable bonds due in 2023 issued on August 26, 2020.  Proceeds from the borrowings in 2021 and 2020 were used to redeem debt and for general corporate purposes.  Commercial paper net payments were $1.1
billion in the current year compared to net borrowings of $0.8 billion in the prior year.  Long-term debt payments in the current year of $0.5 billion consisted of the early redemption of the $500
million aggregate principal amount of 2.750% notes due 2025 in September 2021.  Long-term debt payments in the prior year of $2.1 billion related primarily to the early redemption of the $0.5
billion and $0.4
billion aggregate principal amounts of 4.479% debentures due in 2021 and 3.375% debentures due in 2022, respectively, the repurchase of $0.7
billion aggregate principal amount of certain outstanding notes and debentures, and the redemption of $0.2
billion aggregate principal amount of private placement notes due in 2021 and 2024.  Share repurchases in the current year were insignificant compared to $0.1 billion in the prior year.  Dividends paid in the current year of $0.8 billion were comparable to the prior year.

At December
31, 2021, ADM had $0.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and a current ratio, defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, of 1.5 to 1.

Included in working capital is $9.8 billion of readily marketable commodity inventories.

At December
31, 2021, the Company’s capital resources included shareholders’ equity of $22.5 billion and lines of credit, including the accounts receivable securitization programs described below, totaling $11.2 billion, of which $8.1 billion was unused.

ADM’s ratio of long-term debt to total capital (the sum of long-term debt and shareholders’ equity) was 26% and 28% at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The Company uses this ratio as a measure of ADM’s long-term indebtedness and an indicator of financial flexibility.

The Company’s ratio of net debt (the sum of short-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt less the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities) to capital (the sum of net debt and shareholders’ equity) was 28% and 32% at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Of the Company’s total lines of credit, $5.0 billion supported the commercial paper borrowing programs, against which there was $0.8 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December
31, 2021.

During the second half of 2020, the global credit market stabilized with corporate credit spreads below pre-pandemic levels.  Continued actions by central banks provided additional support in both the short-term and long-term funding markets further stabilizing corporate credit markets.  Low benchmark yields and favorable credit spreads coupled with continued strong cash flow generation during the second half of 2020 presented opportunities for ADM to re-balance the company’s liability portfolio to pre-pandemic levels.  Starting in June 2020, ADM began a series of liability management transactions including multiple early debt redemptions to capitalize on all-time low interest rates.

As of December
31, 2021, the Company had $0.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $0.5 billion of which is cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested.  Based on the Company’s historical ability to generate sufficient cash flows from its U.S. operations and unused and available U.S. credit capacity of $5.2 billion, the Company has asserted that these funds are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  

The Company has accounts receivable securitization programs (the “Programs”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers.  The Programs provide the Company with up to $2.3 billion in funding against accounts receivable transferred into the Programs and expand the Company’s access to liquidity through efficient use of its balance sheet assets (see Note 19 in Item 8 for more information and disclosures on the Programs).  As of December
31, 2021, the Company utilized $2.2 billion of its facility under the Programs.  

On November 5, 2014, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 100,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock during the period commencing January 1, 2015 and ending December 31, 2019.  On August 7, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the extension of the stock repurchase program through December 31, 2024 and the repurchase of up to an additional 100,000,000 shares under the extended program.  The Company has acquired approximately 95.5 million shares under this program as of December 31, 2021.

In 2022, the Company expects capital expenditures of $1.3 billion and additional cash outlays of approximately $0.9 billion in dividends and up to $150 million in share repurchases, subject to other strategic uses of capital and the evolution of operating cash flows and the working capital position throughout the year.

The Company’s purchase obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $18.6
billion and $19.7 billion, respectively.

The decrease is primarily related to obligations to purchase lower quantities of agricultural commodity inventories.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations of $15.8
billion within the next twelve months.  The Company's other material cash requirements within the next 12 months include commercial paper outstanding of $0.8 billion, current maturities of long-term debt of $570 million, interest payments of $305
million, operating lease payments of $310 million, transition tax liability of $20
million, and pension and other postretirement plan contributions of $100
million.  The Company expects to make payments related to purchase obligations and other material cash requirements beyond the next twelve months of $18.2
billion. 

The Company’s credit facilities and certain debentures require the Company to comply with specified financial and non-financial covenants including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth as well as limitations related to incurring liens, secured debt, and certain other financing arrangements.

The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of December
31, 2021.

The three major credit rating agencies have maintained the Company’s credit ratings at solid investment grade levels with stable outlooks.

Critical Accounting Policies

The process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities as well as the recognition of revenues and expenses.

These estimates and judgments are based on the Company’s historical experience and management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.

Certain of the Company’s accounting policies are considered critical, as these policies are important to the depiction of the Company’s financial statements and require significant or complex judgment by management.

Management has discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee the development, selection, disclosure, and application of these critical accounting policies.

Following are the accounting policies management considers critical to the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements - Inventories and Commodity Derivatives

Certain of the Company’s inventory and commodity derivative assets and liabilities as of December
31, 2021 are valued at estimated fair values, including $9.8 billion of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, $1.4 billion of commodity derivative assets, $1.8 billion of commodity derivative liabilities, and $1.0 billion of inventory-related payables.

Commodity derivative assets and liabilities include forward purchase and sales contracts for agricultural commodities.  Merchandisable agricultural commodities are freely traded, have quoted market prices, and may be sold without significant additional processing.

Management estimates fair value for its commodity-related assets and liabilities based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets.

The Company’s inventory and derivative commodity fair value measurements are mainly based on observable market quotations without significant adjustments and are therefore reported as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Level 3 fair value measurements of approximately $3.5 billion of assets and $0.9 billion of liabilities represent fair value estimates where unobservable price components represent 10% or more of the total fair value price.

For more information concerning amounts reported as Level 3, see Note 4 in Item 8.

Changes in the market values of these inventories and commodity contracts are recognized in the statement of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

If management used different methods or factors to estimate market value, amounts reported as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to year-end, amounts reported in future periods as inventories and cost of products sold could differ materially.

Derivatives – Designated Hedging Activities

The Company, from time to time, uses derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the purchase or sales price of anticipated volumes of commodities to be purchased and processed in a future month.  Assuming normal market conditions, the change in the market value of such derivative contracts has historically been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.

Gains and losses arising from open and closed hedging transactions are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold and revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings.

If it is determined that the derivative instruments used are no longer effective at offsetting changes in the price of the hedged item, then the changes in the market value of these exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts would be recorded immediately in the statement of earnings as a component of revenues and/or cost of products sold.

See Note 5 in Item 8 for additional information.

Investments in Affiliates

The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence.

These investments are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings and are adjusted, where appropriate, for amortizable basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.

Generally, the minimum ownership threshold for asserting significant influence is 20% ownership of the investee.

However, the Company considers all relevant factors in determining its ability to assert significant influence including, but not limited to, ownership percentage, board membership, customer and vendor relationships, and other arrangements.

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.  These standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company faces challenges from U.S. and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due.

These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions.

In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records reserves for estimates of potential additional tax owed by the Company.

For example, the Company has received tax assessments from tax authorities in Argentina and the Netherlands, challenging income tax positions taken by subsidiaries of the Company.

The Company evaluated its tax positions for these matters and concluded, based in part upon advice from legal counsel, that it was appropriate to recognize the tax benefits of these positions (see Note 13 in Item 8 for additional information).

Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as tax deductions or credits in future tax returns where the related tax benefit has already been recognized in the Company’s income statement.

The realization of the Company’s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.

The Company evaluates all available positive and negative evidence including estimated future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial results.  Valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets have been established to the extent the realization of the tax benefit is not likely.  During 2021, the Company decreased valuation allowances by $52 million primarily related to expired state attributes.  To the extent the Company were to favorably resolve matters for which valuation allowances have been established or is unable to realize amounts in excess of the aforementioned valuation allowances, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted.

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures amounting to approximately $12.7 billion at December
31, 2021, are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. 

The Company has a responsibility to ensure that all ADM businesses within the Company follow responsible tax practices.  ADM manages its tax affairs based upon the following key principles:

–

a commitment to paying tax in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates;

–

a commitment to the effective, sustainable, and active management of the Company's tax affairs; and 

–

developing and sustaining open and honest relationships with the governments and jurisdictions in which the Company operates regarding the formulation of tax laws.

Property, Plant, and Equipment and Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company is principally engaged in the business of procuring, transporting, storing, processing, and merchandising agricultural commodities and products.

This business is global in nature and is highly capital-intensive.

Both the availability of the Company’s raw materials and the demand for the Company’s finished products are driven by factors such as weather, plantings, government programs and policies, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

These aforementioned factors may cause a shift in the supply/demand dynamics for the Company’s raw materials and finished products.

Any such shift will cause management to evaluate the efficiency and cash flows of the Company’s assets in terms of geographic location, size, and age of its facilities.

The Company, from time to time, will also invest in equipment, technology, and companies related to new, value-added products produced from agricultural commodities and products.

These new products are not always successful from either a commercial production or marketing perspective.

Management evaluates the Company’s property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.

In addition, assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose or to employ the assets in alternative uses or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.

If management used different estimates and assumptions in its evaluation of these assets, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  During the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, asset abandonment and impairment charges for property, plant, and equipment were $73 million, $28 million, and $131 million, respectively.

[/TABLE]

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805, 

Business Combinations,

 as amended

.  

The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and related allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually on October 1 or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.

The Company has seven reporting units identified at one level below the operating segment using the criteria in ASC 350, 

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other 

(Topic 350).  The Company adopted the provisions of Topic 350, which permits, but does not require, a company to qualitatively assess indicators of a reporting unit’s fair value.  If after completing the qualitative assessment, a company believes it is likely that a reporting unit is impaired, a discounted cash flow analysis is prepared to estimate fair value.  Critical estimates in the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows, revenue growth, and discount rates.  During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment in six reporting units and using a quantitative assessment in one reporting unit.  The estimated fair value of the reporting unit evaluated for impairment using a quantitative assessment was substantially in excess of its carrying value.  Definite-lived intangible assets, including capitalized expenses related to the Company’s 1ADM program such as third-party configuration costs and internal labor, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to 50 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying values may not be fully recoverable.  The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $52 million related to goodwill and other intangibles, $26 million related to customer lists, and $11 million related goodwill and other intangibles during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively (see Note 18 in Item 8 for more information).  If management used different estimates and assumptions in its impairment tests, then the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company provides substantially all U.S. employees and employees at certain international subsidiaries with retirement benefits including defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans.

The Company provides certain eligible U.S. employees who retire under qualifying conditions with subsidized postretirement health care coverage or Health Care Reimbursement Accounts.

40

[TABLE]

Item 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)

[/TABLE]

In order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans, management makes several estimates and assumptions, including interest rates used to discount certain liabilities, rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans, rates of compensation increases, employee turnover rates, anticipated mortality rates, and anticipated future health care costs.

These estimates and assumptions are based on the Company’s historical experience combined with management’s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances.

Management also uses third-party actuaries to assist in measuring the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans.

If management used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans, the funded status of the plans could vary significantly, and the Company could recognize different amounts of expense over future periods.  A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would result in a $90
million decrease to the Company's pension benefit obligation improving the funded status by the same amount while a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $4
million.

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses.  Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods.  For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants.  For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants.  The amortization periods range from 2 to 28 years for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and from 6 to 21 years for the Company’s postretirement benefit plans. 

[TABLE]

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

[/TABLE]

The market risk inherent in the Company’s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in: commodity market prices as they relate to the Company’s net commodity position, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates as described below.

Commodities

The availability and prices of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to factors such as changes in weather conditions, crop disease, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in customer preferences and standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops.

The Company manages its exposure to adverse price movements of agricultural commodities used for, and produced in, its business operations, by entering into derivative and non-derivative contracts which reduce the Company’s overall short or long commodity position.

Additionally, the Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.

The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the cash prices of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets. In addition, the Company, from time-to-time, enters into derivative contracts which are designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities that will be purchased and processed, or sold, in a future month. The changes in the market value of such futures contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item. Gains and losses arising from open and closed designated hedging transactions are deferred in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, and recognized as a component of cost of products sold or revenues in the statement of earnings when the hedged item is recognized.

The Company’s commodity position consists of merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, related purchase and sales contracts, energy and freight contracts, and exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and over-the-counter option contracts including contracts used to hedge anticipated transactions.

The fair value of the Company’s commodity position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing all of the commodity positions at quoted market prices for the period, where available, or utilizing a close proxy.

The Company has established metrics to monitor the amount of market risk exposure, which consist of volumetric limits, and value-at-risk (VaR) limits. VaR measures the potential loss, at a 95% confidence level, that could be incurred over a one year period.

Volumetric limits are monitored daily and VaR calculations and sensitivity analysis are monitored weekly.

[TABLE]

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK (Continued)

[/TABLE]

In addition to measuring the hypothetical loss resulting from an adverse two standard deviation move in market prices (assuming no correlations) over a one year period using VaR, sensitivity analysis is performed measuring the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in market prices.

The highest, lowest, and average weekly position for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020 together with the market risk from a hypothetical 10% adverse price change is as follows:

The change in fair value of the average position was due to the increase in average quantities and prices of the underlying commodities.

Currencies

The Company has consolidated subsidiaries in more than 70 countries.

For the majority of the Company’s subsidiaries located outside the United States, the local currency is the functional currency except certain significant subsidiaries in Switzerland where Euro is the functional currency, and Brazil and Argentina where U.S. dollar is the functional currency.

To reduce the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to minimize its foreign currency position related to transactions denominated primarily in Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Brazilian real currencies.

These currencies represent the major functional or local currencies in which recurring business transactions occur.

The Company also uses currency exchange contracts as hedges against amounts indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.

The currency exchange contracts used are forward contracts, swaps with banks, exchange-traded futures contracts, and over-the-counter options.

The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to the price changes in the currency of the related transactions. The potential loss in fair value for such net currency position resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates is not material.

The amount the Company considers indefinitely invested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures translated into dollars using the year-end exchange rates is $10.6 billion and $10.5 billion ($12.7 billion and $12.5 billion at historical rates) at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The increase is due to the increase in retained earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of $0.2 billion partially offset by the depreciation of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar of $0.1
billion. 

The potential loss in fair value, which would principally be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income, resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates is $1.3 billion for December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Actual results may differ.

Interest

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using quoted market prices, where available, and discounted future cash flows based on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. Such fair value exceeded the long-term debt carrying value. Market risk is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 50 basis points decrease in interest rates.

Actual results may differ.

The increase in the fair value of long-term debt at December
31, 2021 is primarily due to increased borrowings.

The Company is a global leader in human and animal nutrition and the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing company.  ADM’s breadth, depth, insights, facilities and logistical expertise give the Company unparalleled capabilities to meet needs for food, beverages, health and wellness, and more.  From the seed of the idea to the outcome of the solution, ADM enriches the quality of life the world over.

The Company transforms natural products into staple foods, sustainable, renewable industrial products, and an expansive pantry of food and beverage ingredients and solutions for foods and beverages, supplements, nutrition for pets and livestock and more.

At ADM, sustainable practices and a focus on environmental responsibility are not separate from its primary business:  they are integral to the work the Company does every day to serve customers and create value for shareholders.  The Company is one of the world’s leading producers of ingredients for human and animal nutrition, and other products made from nature.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company consolidates all entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs), in which it has a controlling financial interest.  For VIEs, the Company assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary as defined under the applicable accounting standard.  Investments in affiliates, including VIEs through which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control the investee and is not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, are carried at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings since acquisition and are adjusted, where appropriate, for basis differences between the investment balance and the underlying net assets of the investee.

The Company’s portion of the results of certain affiliates and results of certain VIEs are included using the most recent available financial statements.

In each case, the financial statements are within 93 days of the Company’s year-end and are consistent from period to period.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded revaluation gains on cost method investments of $
49

million in connection with observable third-party transactions in investment income (previously interest income) in the consolidated statements of earnings.  Revaluation gains previously recorded in other (income) expense - net of $
23

million and $
4

million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Effective December 31, 2021, the Company reported $
87

million of intangible assets in process in goodwill and other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets.  Intangible assets in process previously reported in construction in progress in property, plant, and equipment of $
172

million as of December 31, 2020 were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all non-segregated, highly-liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Segregated Cash and Investments

The Company segregates certain cash, cash equivalents, and investment balances in accordance with regulatory requirements, commodity exchange requirements, and insurance arrangements.  These balances represent deposits received from customers of the Company’s registered futures commission merchant and commodity brokerage services, cash margins and securities pledged to commodity exchange clearinghouses, and cash pledged as security under certain insurance arrangements.  Segregated cash and investments also include restricted cash collateral for the various insurance programs of the Company’s captive insurance business.    To the degree these segregated balances are comprised of cash and cash equivalents, they are considered restricted cash and cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows.

Receivables

The Company records accounts receivable at net realizable value.

This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts of $
122

million and $
100
 million at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances including any accrued interest receivables thereon.

Long-term receivables recorded in other assets were not material to the Company’s overall receivables portfolio. 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), and developed a new methodology for estimating uncollectible accounts.  Under this methodology, receivables are pooled according to type, region, credit risk rating, and age.  Each pool is assigned an expected loss co-efficient to arrive at a general reserve based on historical write-offs adjusted, as needed, for regional, economic, and other forward-looking factors.  The Company minimizes credit risk due to the large and diversified nature of its worldwide customer base.  ADM manages its exposure to counter-party credit risk through credit analysis and approvals, credit limits, and monitoring procedures.  The Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at January 1, 2020 of $
8

million as a result of the adoption of Topic 326. 

The Company recorded bad debt expense in selling, general, and administrative expenses of $
32

million, $
47

million, and $
23

million in the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, which include inventories acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at market value.

In addition, the Company values certain inventories using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company also valued certain of its agricultural commodity inventories using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Company changed the method of accounting for certain of its agricultural commodity inventories from the LIFO method to market value in the Ag Services and Oilseeds segment.  The Company believes market value is preferable because it:  (i) conforms to the inventory valuation methodology used for the majority of ADM’s agricultural commodity inventories; (ii) enhances the matching of inventory costs with revenues and better reflects the current cost of inventory on the Company’s balance sheet; and (iii) provides better comparability with the Company’s peers.

The Company concluded that the accounting change did not have a material effect on prior periods’ financial statements and elected not to apply the change on a retrospective basis.  As a result, the Company recorded a reduction in cost of products sold of $
91

million ($
69

million after tax, equal to $
0.12
 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect of the change in the year ended December 31, 2020 with no impact to the statement of cash flows.  The change did not have a material impact on the Company’s results for the year ended December 31, 2020.

If the Company had not made the accounting change, the effect of LIFO valuation on ADM’s operating results would have been an increase in cost of goods sold of $
147

million ($
113

million after tax, equal to $
0.20
 per diluted share) in the year ended December 31, 2020, with no impact to the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The following table sets forth the Company’s inventories as of December
31, 2021 and 2020.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
The Company uses the market approach valuation technique to measure the majority of its assets and liabilities carried at fair value.

Three levels are established within the fair value hierarchy that may be used to report fair value:  Level 1:

Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2:  Observable inputs, including Level 1 prices that have been adjusted; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges; and other inputs that are observable or can be substantially corroborated by observable market data.  Level 3:  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

In evaluating the significance of fair value inputs, the Company generally classifies assets or liabilities as Level 3 when their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs that individually or when aggregated with other unobservable inputs, represent more than 10% of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Judgment is required in evaluating both quantitative and qualitative factors in the determination of significance for purposes of fair value level classification.

Level 3 amounts can include assets and liabilities whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Based on historical experience with the Company’s suppliers and customers, the Company’s own credit risk and knowledge of current market conditions, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.

However, in certain cases, if the Company believes the nonperformance risk to be a significant input, the Company records estimated fair value adjustments, and classifies the measurement in Level 3.

In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy.

The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy.

The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.

The Company’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Derivatives

The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in its consolidated balance sheet.

Unrealized gains are reported as other current assets and unrealized losses are reported as accrued expenses and other payables.  The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the type of hedging relationship.

The majority of the Company’s derivatives have not been designated as hedging instruments, and as such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.

For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the hedging instrument, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge or a net investment hedge.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.

Cost Method Investments

Cost method investments of $
297

million and $
178

million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are included in Other Assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.  Revaluation gains of $
49

million, $
23

million, and $
4

million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, in connection with observable third-party transactions, are recorded in investment income in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The Company generally uses the straight-line method in computing depreciation for financial reporting purposes and generally uses accelerated methods for income tax purposes. The annual provisions for depreciation have been computed principally in accordance with the following ranges of asset lives: buildings - 
15
 to 
40
 years; machinery and equipment - 
3
 to 
40
 years.

The Company capitalized interest on major construction projects in progress of $
17
 million, $
14
 million, and $
15
 million for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using statutory rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recorded in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  Applicable accounting standards prescribe a minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company recognizes in its consolidated financial statements tax positions determined more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position.

The Company classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest expense and classifies tax-related penalties as selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Goodwill and other intangible assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.

Definite-lived intangible assets, including capitalized expenses related to the Company’s 1ADM program such as third-party configuration costs and internal labor, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 
1
 to 
50
 years and are reviewed for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  The Company’s accounting policy is to evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. 
The Company recorded impairment charges totaling $
52

million related to goodwill and other intangibles, $
26

million related to customer lists, and $
11

million related goodwill and other intangibles during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively (see Note 9 for additional information).

Asset Abandonments and Write-Downs

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.

In addition, assets are written down to fair value after consideration of the Company’s ability to utilize the assets for their intended purpose, employ the assets in alternative uses, or sell the assets to recover the carrying value.

Fair value is generally based on discounted cash flow analysis which relies on management’s estimate of market participant assumptions or estimated selling price for assets considered held for sale (a Level 3 measurement under applicable accounting standards).  During 2020, the Company temporarily idled certain of its corn processing assets where ethanol is produced and performed a quantitative impairment assessment of those assets, resulting in no impairment charges.  The Company restarted these idled facilities in April 2021.  The total carrying value of the temporarily idled assets as of December 31, 2020 was immaterial. During the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, asset abandonment and impairment charges were $
73
 million, $
28
 million, and $
131
 million, respectively.

Payables to Brokerage Customers

Payables to brokerage customers represent the total of customer accounts at the Company’s futures commission merchant with credit or positive balances.  Customer accounts are used primarily in connection with commodity transactions and include gains and losses on open commodity trades as well as securities and other deposits made for margins or other purposes as required by the Company or the exchange-clearing organizations or counterparties.  Payables to brokerage customers have a corresponding balance in segregated cash and investments and customer omnibus receivable in other current assets.

Revenues

The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of ASC Topic 606, 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

 (“Topic 606”).  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20, 

Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets 

(“Topic 610-20”). 

Stock Compensation

The Company recognizes expense for its stock compensation based on the fair value of the awards that are granted.

The Company’s stock compensation plans provide for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options.

The fair values of stock options and performance stock units are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and a lattice valuation model, respectively.

These valuation models require the input of subjective assumptions.

Measured compensation cost, net of forfeitures, is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock compensation award.

Research and Development

Costs associated with research and development are expensed as incurred.

Such costs incurred, net of expenditures subsequently reimbursed by government grants, were $
171
 million, $
160
 million, and $
154
 million for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Per Share Data

Basic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net earnings attributable to controlling interests by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.

In computing diluted earnings per share, average number of common shares outstanding is increased by common stock options outstanding with exercise prices lower than the average market price of common shares using the treasury share method.

Business Combinations

The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 

Business Combinations,

 as amended

.  

The consideration transferred is allocated to various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date with the residual allocated to goodwill.  Fair values allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.  Management makes estimates of fair values based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable.  These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.  The estimated fair values related to intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and developed technology which are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models.  Estimates in the discounted cash flow models include, but are not limited to, certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g. revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and royalty rates).  These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.  During the measurement period, which may take up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments due to changes in the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded as adjustments to the consideration transferred and the related allocations.  Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or the final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any such adjustments are charged to the consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company accounts for any redeemable noncontrolling interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest at redemption value with periodic changes recorded in retained earnings.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the amended guidance of ASC Topic 740, 

Income Taxes 

(Topic 740), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also simplify and improve consistent application of other areas of Topic 740.  The adoption of the amended guidance did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Pending Accounting Standards

Through December 31, 2022, the Company has the option to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 848, 

Reference Rate Reform

, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform.  The expedients and exceptions provided by the amended guidance do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship.
 The Company plans to adopt the expedients and exceptions provided by the amended guidance before the December 31, 2022 expiry date and does not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2023, the Company will be required to adopt the amended guidance of ASC Topic 805, 

Business Combinations

, which improves comparability for both the recognition and measurement of acquired revenue contracts with customers at the date of and after a business combination.  The amended guidance requires an entity (acquirer) to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2.

Revenues

Revenue Recognition

The Company principally generates revenue from merchandising and transporting agricultural commodities, and manufacturing  products for use in food, beverages, feed, energy, and industrial applications, and ingredients and solutions for human and animal nutrition.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with a customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  The Company follows a policy of recognizing revenue at a single point in time when it satisfies its performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer.  The majority of the Company’s contracts with customers have one performance obligation and a contract duration of one year or less.  The Company applies the practical expedient in paragraph 10-50-14 of Topic 606 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of Topic 606.  The Company recognized revenue from transportation service contracts of $
606
 million, $
423
 million, and $
515

million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by ASC 610-20.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs related to contracts with customers for the sale of goods are accounted for as a fulfillment activity and are included in cost of products sold.  Accordingly, amounts billed to customers for such costs are included as a component of revenues.

Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities

The Company does not include taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers, in the measurement of transactions prices or as a component of revenues and cost of products sold.

Contract Liabilities

Contract liabilities relate to advance payments from customers for goods and services that the Company has yet to provide.  Contract liabilities of $
581
 million and $
626
 million as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were recorded in accrued expenses and other payables in the consolidated balance sheet.  Contract liabilities recognized as revenues for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020 were $
626
 million and $
604
 million, respectively.

Revenues (Continued)

Ag Services and Oilseeds

The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment generates revenue from the sale of commodities, from service fees for the transportation of goods, from the sale of products manufactured in its global processing facilities, and from its structured trade finance activities.  Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties.  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control over a product or providing service to a customer.  For transportation service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time as the barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, or container freight moves towards its destination in accordance with the transfer of control guidance of  Topic 606.  The amount of revenue recognized follows the contractually specified price which may include freight or other contractually specified cost components.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Carbohydrate Solutions

The Carbohydrate Solutions segment generates revenue from the sale of products manufactured at the Company’s global corn and wheat milling facilities around the world.  Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer.  Products are shipped to customers from the Company’s various facilities and from its network of storage terminals.  The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration specified in the contract which could include freight and other costs depending on the specific shipping terms of each contract.  For physically settled derivative sales contracts that are outside the scope of Topic 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of the inventory is transferred within the meaning of Topic 606 as required by Topic 610-20.

Nutrition

The Nutrition segment sells ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, edible beans, formula feeds, animal health and nutrition products, pet food and treats, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  Revenue is recognized when control over products is transferred to the customer.  The amount of revenue recognized follows the contracted price or the mutually agreed price of the product.  Freight and shipping are recognized as a component of revenue at the same time control transfers to the customer. 

Other Business

Other Business includes the Company’s futures commission business whose primary sources of revenue are commissions and brokerage income generated from executing orders and clearing futures contracts and options on futures contracts on behalf of its customers.  Commissions and brokerage revenue are recognized on the date the transaction is executed.  Other Business also includes the Company’s captive insurance business which generates third party revenue through its proportionate share of premiums from third-party reinsurance pools.  Reinsurance premiums are recognized on a straight-line basis over the period underlying the policy.

Note 3.

Acquisitions

Operating results of acquisitions are included in the Company’s financial statements from the date of acquisition and were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2021.  Goodwill allocated in connection with the acquisitions is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the Company’s acquisition of the businesses.

Acquisitions (Continued)

Fiscal year 2021 acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s Nutrition segment acquired 
five
 businesses including, a 
75
% majority stake in U.S.-based PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, The Pound Bakery, and NutraDine (collectively, “P4”), premier providers of private label pet treats and supplements; Deerland Probiotics & Enzymes (“Deerland”), a leader in probiotic, prebiotic, and enzyme technology; and Sojaprotein, a leading European provider of non-GMO soy ingredients, for an aggregate consideration of $
1.6

billion using cash on hand.  The aggregate cash consideration of these acquisitions, net of $
21

million in cash acquired, was preliminarily allocated as follows.  The Company expects these purchase price allocations to change once valuations and measurement period adjustments are final. 

The Company has the option to acquire the remaining 
25
% interest in P4 from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2025, based on a fixed multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the 
twelve months
 prior to the exercise of this option.  The noncontrolling interest holders also have the option to put the 25% interest to the Company on the same terms.  The Company records the 
25
% remaining interest in temporary equity - redeemable noncontrolling interest.

Of the $
860
 million allocated to goodwill, $
313

million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The 2021 acquisitions advance ADM’s growth strategy by expanding the Company’s capabilities in pet treat and supplements and the fast-growing global demand for plant-based proteins as well as capabilities in the high-value flavor segment and the fast growing demand for food, beverages, and supplements.  The post-acquisition financial results of these acquisitions are reported in the Nutrition segment.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Estimated fair values for inventories and inventory-related payables carried at market are based on exchange-quoted prices, adjusted for differences in local markets and quality, referred to as basis.

Market valuations for the Company’s inventories are adjusted for location and quality (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.

The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions in either the listed or over the counter (OTC) markets and are considered observable.  In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity.  When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the inventory is classified in Level 3.  Changes in the fair value of inventories are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

63

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

Derivative contracts include exchange-traded commodity futures and options contracts, forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, and OTC instruments related primarily to agricultural commodities, energy, interest rates, and foreign currencies.

Exchange-traded futures and options contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified in Level 1.

The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded futures and options contracts are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables.

Fair value for forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is estimated based on exchange-quoted prices adjusted for differences in local markets.

Market valuations for the Company’s forward commodity purchase and sale contracts are adjusted for location (basis) because the exchange-quoted prices represent contracts that have standardized terms for commodity, quantity, future delivery period, delivery location, and commodity quality or grade.  The basis adjustments are generally determined using inputs from competitor and broker quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets and are considered observable.  In some cases, the basis adjustments are unobservable because they are supported by little to no market activity.

When observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the contract, it is classified in Level 2.

When unobservable inputs have a significant impact (more than 10%) on the measurement of fair value, the contract is classified in Level 3.

Except for certain derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of commodity-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of cost of products sold.

Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net, depending upon the purpose of the contract.

The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as effective cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) until the hedged items are recorded in earnings or it is probable the hedged transaction will no longer occur.

The Company’s cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds valued using quoted market prices and are classified as Level 1.

The Company’s segregated investments are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  U.S. Treasury securities are valued using quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1.

The debt conversion option is the equity linked embedded derivative related to the exchangeable bonds described in Note 10.  The fair value of the embedded derivative is included in long-term debt, with changes in fair value recognized as interest, and is valued with the assistance of a third-party pricing service (a level 3 measurement).

Transfers into Level 3 of assets and liabilities previously classified in Level 2 were due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts rising above the 10% threshold.

Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily due to the relative value of unobservable inputs to the total fair value measurement of certain products and derivative contracts falling below the 10% threshold and thus permitting reclassification to Level 2.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4.

Fair Value Measurements (Continued)

In some cases, the price components that result in differences between exchange-traded prices and local prices for inventories and commodity purchase and sale contracts are observable based upon available quotations for these pricing components, and in some cases, the differences are unobservable.  These price components primarily include transportation costs and other adjustments required due to location, quality, or other contract terms.  In the table below, these other adjustments are referred to as basis.  The changes in unobservable price components are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the movement of these unobservable price components. 

The following table sets forth the weighted average percentage of the unobservable price components included in the Company’s Level 3 valuations as of December
31, 2021 and 2020.

The Company’s Level 3 measurements may include basis only, transportation cost only, or both price components.

As an example, for Level 3 inventories with basis, the unobservable component as of December
31, 2021 is a weighted average 
28.7
% of the total price for assets and 
13.1
% of the total price for liabilities.

In certain of the Company’s principal markets, the Company relies on price quotes from third parties to value its inventories and physical commodity purchase and sale contracts.

These price quotes are generally not further adjusted by the Company in determining the applicable market price.

In some cases, availability of third-party quotes is limited to only one or two independent sources.

In these situations, absent other corroborating evidence, the Company considers these price quotes as 100% unobservable and, therefore, the fair value of these items is reported in Level 3.

Note 5.

Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

The majority of the Company’s derivative instruments have not been designated as hedging instruments.  The Company uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts to manage its net position of merchandisable agricultural product inventories and forward cash purchase and sales contracts to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in agricultural commodities and foreign currencies.

The Company also uses exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts as components of merchandising strategies designed to enhance margins.

The results of these strategies can be significantly impacted by factors such as the correlation between the value of exchange-traded commodities futures contracts and the value of the underlying commodities, counterparty contract defaults, and volatility of freight markets.

Derivatives, including exchange traded contracts and forward commodity purchase or sale contracts, and inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural products, which include amounts acquired under deferred pricing contracts, are stated at fair value or market value.

Inventory is not a derivative and therefore fair values of and changes in fair values of inventories are not included in the tables below.

Changes in the market value of inventories of certain merchandisable agricultural commodities, forward cash purchase and sales contracts, exchange-traded futures, and exchange-traded and OTC options contracts are recognized in earnings immediately as a component of cost of products sold.

Changes in the fair value of foreign currency-related derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings as a component of revenues, cost of products sold, and other (income) expense - net depending on the purpose of the contract.

Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow or Net Investment Hedging Strategies

The Company had certain derivatives designated as cash flow and net investment hedges as of December
31, 2021 and 2020. 

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, foreign exchange gains and losses related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates are deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested. 

The Company uses cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange forwards designated as net investment hedges to protect the Company’s investment in a foreign subsidiary against changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company executed USD-fixed to Euro-fixed cross-currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
1.2
 billion and $
1.3

billion as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and foreign exchange forwards with an aggregate notional amount of $
2.6

billion and $
1.8

billion as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had after-tax losses of $
44
 million and $
202

million in AOCI, respectively, related to foreign exchange gains and losses from the net investment hedge transactions.  The amount is deferred in AOCI until the underlying investment is divested.

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flow that is attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI and as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows and reclassified into earnings in the same line item affected by the hedged transaction and in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

Hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and gains and losses related to discontinued hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings during the current period.

The Company’s structured trade finance programs use interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the forecasted interest payments on certain letters of credit from banks. The terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the forecasted interest payments. The deferred gains and losses are recognized in revenues over the period in which the related interest payments are paid to the banks.  The amounts are recorded in revenues as the related results are also recorded in revenues.  As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had interest rate swaps maturing on various dates with aggregate notional amounts of $
1.0

billion and  $
3.3

billion, respectively.

The Company also uses swap locks designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the changes in the forecasted interest payments due to changes in the benchmark rate leading up to future bond issuance dates.  The terms of the swap locks match the terms of the forecasted interest payments.  The deferred gains and losses will be recognized in interest expense over the period in which the related interest payments will be paid.  As of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company executed swap locks maturing on various dates with an aggregate notional amount of $
400

million and $
550

million, respectively.

At December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had after-tax gains of $
35
 million and $
31

million in AOCI, respectively, related to the interest rate swaps and swap locks. The Company expects to recognize amounts deferred in AOCI in its consolidated statement of earnings during the life of the instruments.

Derivative Instruments & Hedging Activities (Continued)

For each of the hedge programs described below, the derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

The changes in the market value of such derivative contracts have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in price movements of the hedged item.

Once the hedged item is recognized in earnings, the gains and losses arising from the hedge are reclassified from AOCI to either revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable. 
As of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had after-tax gains of $
161
 million and $
133

million in AOCI, respectively, related to gains and losses from these programs.

The Company expects to recognize $
161
 million of the 2021 after-tax gains in its consolidated statement of earnings during the next 12 months.

The Company uses futures or options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of corn to be purchased and processed in a future month.

The objective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s forecasted purchases of corn.

Prior to April 2020, the Company’s corn processing plants were grinding approximately 

72

 million bushels of corn per month.   From April 2020 to March 2021, the Company temporarily idled dry mill assets and as a result, was grinding approximately 

56

million bushels of corn per month.

In April 2021, the Company resumed ethanol production at its two corn dry mill facilities.  In November 2021, the Company sold its ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois, which reduced normal grinding at its corn processing plants to approximately 
65

million bushels per month.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 
23
% and 
33
% of its monthly grind.

At December
31, 2021, the Company had designated hedges representing between 
11
% to 
26
% of its anticipated monthly grind of corn for the next 
12
 months.

The Company, from time to time, also uses futures, options, and swaps to hedge the sales price of certain ethanol sales contracts.

The Company has established hedging programs for ethanol sales contracts that are indexed to unleaded gasoline prices and to various exchange-traded ethanol contracts.  The objective of these hedging programs is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the Company’s sales of ethanol.  During the past 12 months and as of December
31, 2021, the Company had 
no
 hedges related to ethanol sales.

The Company uses futures and options contracts to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of soybeans to be purchased and processed in a future month for certain of its U.S. soybean crush facilities, subject to certain program limits.  The Company also uses futures or options contracts to hedge the sales prices of anticipated soybean meal and soybean oil sales proportionate to the soybean crushing process at these facilities, subject to certain program limits.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 
57
% and 
100
% of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities.  At December 31, 2021, the Company had designated hedges representing between 
0
% and 
100
% of the anticipated monthly soybean crush for soybean purchases and soybean meal and oil sales at the designated facilities over the next 
12
 months.

The Company uses futures and OTC swaps to hedge the purchase price of anticipated volumes of natural gas consumption in a future month for certain of its facilities in North America and Europe, subject to certain program limits.  During the past 12 months, the Company hedged between 
23
% and 
96
% of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption at the designated facilities.  At December
31, 2021, the Company had designated hedges representing between 
21
% and 
100
% of the anticipated monthly natural gas consumption over the next 
12
 months.

, ADM Ag issued $
300

million aggregate principal amount of 
zero
 coupon exchangeable bonds (the “Bonds”) due in 2023 to non-U.S. persons outside of the U.S.  Subject to and upon compliance with the terms and conditions of the Bonds and any conditions, procedures, and certifications prescribed thereunder, the Bonds will be exchangeable for ordinary shares of Wilmar International Limited (“Wilmar”) currently held by the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries.  
Effective September 7, 2021, holders of the Bonds will be entitled to receive 52,840.6571 Wilmar shares (the “Exchange Property per Bond”) for each $200,000 principal amount of the Bonds, on the exercise of their exchange rights, subject to dividend adjustments.
  
Effective February 26, 2022, ADM Ag has the option to call the outstanding Bonds at their principal amount if the value of the Exchange Property per Bond exceeds 120% of the principal amount for 20 consecutive trading days.
  The Company accounts for the Bond’s exchange feature as an equity-linked embedded derivative that is not clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument since it is indexed to Wilmar’s stock.  The Company unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of all sums payable and the performance of all of ADM Ag’s other obligations under the Bonds.  In contemplation of the issuance of the Bonds, Archer Daniels Midland Asia-Pacific Limited, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary that holds shares in Wilmar, entered into a stock borrowing and lending agreement with a financial institution.

Stock Compensation

The Company’s employee stock compensation plans provide for the granting of options to employees to purchase common stock of the Company pursuant to the Company’s 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan.

one year
 to 
five years
, and expire 
ten years
 after the date of grant.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11.

Stock Compensation (Continued)

The fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes single option pricing model.

The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.

The volatility of the Company’s stock was calculated based upon the monthly closing price of the Company’s stock for the period immediately prior to the date of grant corresponding to the average expected life of the grant.

The average expected life represents the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding.

The risk-free rate is based on the rate of U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of option grants.

The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes single option pricing model for 2019 were as follows.  No options were granted in 2021 and 2020.

A summary of option activity during 2021 is presented below: 

The weighted-average remaining contractual term of options outstanding and exercisable at December
31, 2021, is 
3
 years and 
3
 years, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable at December
31, 2021, is $
126
 million and $
126
 million, respectively.

The weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $
7.88
.

The total intrinsic values of options exercised during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were $
37
 million, $
32
 million, and $
15
 million, respectively.

Cash proceeds received from options exercised during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were $
64
 million, $
49
 million, and $
27
 million, respectively.

At December
31, 2021, unrecognized compensation expense related to option grants to be recognized as compensation expense during the next year was immaterial. 

The Company’s 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the granting of restricted stock and restricted stock units (Restricted Stock Awards) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.

In addition, the Company’s 2020 Incentive Compensation Plan also provides for the granting of performance stock units (PSUs) at no cost to certain officers and key employees.

Restricted Stock Awards are made in common stock or stock units with equivalent rights and vest at the end of a restriction period of 
three years
.

The awards for PSUs are made in common stock units and vest at the end of a vesting period of 
three years
 subject to the attainment of certain future service and performance criteria based on the Company’s adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC), adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and total shareholder return (TSR).

During the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, 
2.7
 million, 
2.7
 million, and 
2.6
 million common stock or stock units, respectively, were granted as Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.

At December
31, 2021, there were 
16.8
 million shares available for future grants pursuant to the 2020 plan.

77

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11.

Stock Compensation (Continued)

The fair value of Restricted Stock Awards is determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date.

The fair value of PSUs is based on the weighted-average values of adjusted ROIC, adjusted EBITDA, and TSR.  The adjusted ROIC and adjusted EBITDA fair value is determined based on the market value of the Company’s shares on the grant date while the TSR fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation.  The weighted-average grant-date fair values of awards granted during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $
53.28
, $
45.59
, and $
42.11
, respectively.

A summary of Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs activity during 2021 is presented below:

At December
31, 2021, there was $
99
 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Awards and PSUs.

Amounts to be recognized as compensation expense during the next 
three years
 are $
65
 million, $
31
 million, and $
3
 million, respectively.  The total grant-date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards that vested during the year ended December
31, 2021 was $
121
 million.

Compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs granted to employees is generally recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the respective grant.

Certain of the Company’s option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs continue to vest upon the recipient’s retirement from the Company and compensation expense related to option grants and Restricted Stock Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees is recognized in earnings on the date of grant.

Compensation expense for PSUs is based on the probability of meeting the performance criteria.  The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.

Total compensation expense for option grants, Restricted Stock Awards, and PSUs recognized during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $
161
 million, $
151
 million, and $
89
 million, respectively.  Changes in incentive compensation expense are primarily caused by the level of attainment of the PSU performance criteria described above.

Income Taxes (Continued)

Reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate on earnings is as follows:

The effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were impacted by the geographic mix of earnings and U.S. tax credits, including the biodiesel tax credit and the railroad maintenance tax credit.

The foreign rate differential was primarily due to lower tax rates from the Company’s operations in Switzerland, Asia, and the Caribbean.  The Company’s foreign earnings, which were taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate and generated from these jurisdictions, were 
64
%, 
59
%, and 
61
% of its foreign earnings before taxes in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  

Undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures were approximately $
12.7
 billion at December
31, 2021.  Because these undistributed earnings continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, no income taxes, other than the transition tax, the U.S. tax on undistributed Subpart F, and the minimum tax on GILTI, have been provided after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017.  It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures not subject to the transition tax.

The Company has elected to pay the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings over eight years.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s remaining transition tax liability was $
140
 million, which will be paid in installments through 2025.

The Company incurred U.S. taxable income of $
244
 million, $
259
 million, and $
105

million related to GILTI and deducted $
87
 million, $
12
 million, and $
1

million related to FDII in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.  The Company made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI as a period cost.  The Company has recorded and will continue to record the impact of tax reform items as U.S. tax authorities issue Treasury Regulations and other guidance addressing tax reform-related changes.  The additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, may affect significant deductions and income inclusions and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow.

The Company had $
465
 million and $
470
 million of tax assets related to net operating loss carry-forwards of certain international subsidiaries at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of December
31, 2021, approximately $
359
 million of these assets have no expiration date, and the remaining $
106
 million expire at various times through fiscal 2031.

The annual usage of certain of these assets is limited to a percentage of taxable income of the respective foreign subsidiary for the year. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $
200
 million and $
197
 million against these tax assets at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to the uncertainty of their realization.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $
74
 million and $
70
 million against these tax assets at December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company had $
21
 million and $
79

million of tax assets related to state income tax attributes (incentive credits and net operating loss carryforwards), net of federal tax benefit, at December
31, 2021 and 2020, the majority of which will expire between 2022 and 2026.  Due to the uncertainty of realization, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $
13
 million and $
72
 million related to state income tax assets net of federal tax benefit as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The change in the valuation allowance was related to the expiration of certain state income tax attributes which were fully reserved in prior years.

The Company remains subject to federal examination in the U.S. for the calendar tax years 2016 through 2021.

The following table sets forth a rollforward of activity of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December
31, 2021 and 2020 as follows:

The additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown in the table included effects related to net income and shareholders’ equity.

The changes in unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the Company’s net income or cash flow.  At December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits of $
39
 million and $
33
 million, respectively.

The Company is subject to income taxation and routine examinations in many jurisdictions around the world and frequently faces challenges regarding the amount of taxes due.

These challenges include positions taken by the Company related to the timing, nature, and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various jurisdictions.  In its routine evaluations of the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company recognizes a liability, when necessary, for estimated potential tax owed by the Company in accordance with applicable accounting standards.  Resolution of the related tax positions, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, may take years to complete.

Therefore, it is difficult to predict the timing for resolution of tax positions and the Company cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of these ongoing or future examinations.  However, the Company does not anticipate that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly in the next twelve months.

Given the long periods of time involved in resolving tax positions, the Company does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits will have a material impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate in any given period.

If the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits were recognized by the Company at one time, there would be a reduction of $
157
 million on the tax expense for that period.

Income Taxes (Continued)

The Company’s subsidiary in Argentina, ADM Agro SRL (formerly ADM Argentina SA and Alfred C. Toepfer Argentina SRL), received tax assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for the tax years 1999 through 2011 and 2014.  As of December
31, 2021, these assessments totaled $
8
 million in tax and up to $
38
 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  The Argentine tax authorities conducted a review of income and other taxes paid by large exporters and processors of cereals and other agricultural commodities resulting in allegations of income tax evasion.  The Company strongly believes that it has complied with all Argentine tax laws.  To date, the Company has not received assessments for closed years subsequent to 2014.  While the statute of limitations has expired for tax years 2012 and 2013, the Company cannot rule out receiving additional assessments challenging transfer prices used to price grain exports for years subsequent to 2013, and estimates that these potential assessments could be approximately $
60
 million in tax and $
40
 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021).
 The Company believes that it has appropriately evaluated the transactions underlying these assessments, and has concluded, based on Argentine tax law, that its tax position would be sustained, and accordingly, has not recorded a tax liability for these assessments.  In accordance with the accounting requirements for uncertain tax positions, the Company has not recorded an unrecognized tax liability for this assessment because it has concluded that it is more likely than not to prevail on the matter based upon its technical merits and because the taxing jurisdiction’s process does not provide a mechanism for settling at less than the full amount of the assessment.  The Company intends to vigorously defend its position against the current assessments and any similar assessments that may be issued for years subsequent to 2013.

In 2014, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary in the Netherlands, ADM Europe B.V., received a tax assessment from the Netherlands tax authority challenging the transfer pricing aspects of a 2009 business reorganization, which involved two of its subsidiary companies in the Netherlands.  As of December
31, 2021, this assessment was $
92
 million in tax and $
33
 million in interest (adjusted for variation in currency exchange rates).  On April 23, 2020, the court issued an unfavorable ruling and in October 2020, assigned a third party expert to establish a valuation by early 2021.  During the second quarter of 2021, the third party expert issued a final valuation.  The Company expects the court to issue a ruling on this matter in the second quarter of 2022.  Subsequent appeals may take an extended period of time and could result in additional financial impacts of up to the entire amount of the assessment.  The Company has carefully evaluated the underlying transactions and has concluded that the amount of gain recognized on the reorganization for tax purposes was appropriate.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company has accrued its best estimate of what it believes will be the likely outcome of the litigation and will vigorously defend its position against the assessment.

Note 14.

Leases

Lessee Accounting

The Company leases certain transportation equipment, plant equipment, office equipment, land, buildings, and storage facilities.  Most leases include options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 
1
 month to 
49
 years.  The renewal options are not included in the measurement of the right of use assets and lease liabilities unless the Company is reasonably certain to exercise the optional renewal periods.  Certain leases also include index and non-index escalation clauses and options to purchase the leased property.  Leases accounted for as finance leases were immaterial at December
31, 2021.  

As an accounting policy election, the Company does not apply the recognition requirements of Topic 842 to short-term leases in all of its underlying asset categories.  The Company recognizes short-term lease payments in earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.  The Company also combines lease and non-lease contract components in all of its underlying asset categories as an accounting policy election.

Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

In 2021, the Company amended the ADM Retirement Plan and the ADM Pension Plan for Hourly-Wage Employees (collectively, the “Plans”) and entered into two binding agreements to purchase: (1) a group annuity contract from Principal Life Insurance Company (“Principal”) and (2) two group annuity contracts, separately from American General Life Insurance Company (“AGL”) and from AGL’s affiliate, The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (“USL”), irrevocably transferring the future benefit obligations and annuity administration for approximately 
6,000
 retirees and terminated vested participants from the Plans to Principal, AGL, and USL.  The purchase of the group annuity contracts was funded directly by the Plans’ assets and reduced the Company’s pension obligations by approximately $
0.7

billion.  As a result of the transactions, the Company recognized a non-cash pretax pension settlement charge of $
83

million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

In April 2019, the Company announced an enhanced early retirement program for some eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada.   As a result, the Company recognized a pension remeasurement charge of $
48
 million in the second quarter of 2019.  Employees electing to retire early were also given the option to receive their benefit in the form of a lump sum payment which resulted in a pension settlement charge of $
51
 million during the second half of 2019.

On July 31, 2017, the Company announced that all participants in the Company’s U.S. salaried pension plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) will begin accruing benefits under the cash balance formula effective January 1, 2022.  Benefits for participants who were accruing under the final average pay formula were frozen as of December 31, 2021, including pay and service through that date.

The Company maintains 401(k) plans covering substantially all U.S. employees.

The Company contributes cash to the plans to match qualifying employee contributions, and also provides a non-matching employer contribution of 
1
% of pay to eligible participants.

Under an employee stock ownership component of the 401(k) plans, employees may choose to invest in the Company’s stock as part of their own investment elections.

The employer contributions are expensed when paid.

Assets of the Company’s 401(k) plans consist primarily of listed common stocks and pooled funds.

The Company’s 401(k) plans held 
6.5
 million shares of Company common stock at December
31, 2021, with a market value of $
441
 million.

Cash dividends received on shares of Company common stock by these plans during the year ended December
31, 2021 were $
10
 million.

The following tables set forth changes in the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of defined benefit plan assets for the years ended December
31, 2021 and 2020:

The actuarial gain in the pension plans in 2021 is primarily due to increases in the global bond yields while the actuarial loss in the pension plans in 2020 is primarily due to declines in the global bond yields.  

The Company uses the corridor approach when amortizing actuarial losses.  Under the corridor approach, net unrecognized actuarial losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets are amortized over future periods.  For plans with little to no active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average life expectancy of the participants.  For plans with active participants, the amortization period is the remaining average service period of the active participants.  The amortization periods range from 
2
 to 
28
 years for the Company’s defined benefit pension plans and from 
6
 to 
21
 years for the Company’s postretirement benefit plans. 

Included in AOCI for pension benefits at December
31, 2021, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost: unrecognized prior service credit of $
94
 million and unrecognized actuarial loss of $
314
 million.  

Included in AOCI for postretirement benefits at December
31, 2021, are the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic postretirement benefit cost: unrecognized prior service cost of $

The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing the year-end actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations:

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $
1.7
 billion, $
1.6
 billion, and $
1.2
 billion, respectively, as of December
31, 2021, and $
2.6
 billion, $
2.5
 billion, and $
1.9
 billion, respectively, as of December
31, 2020.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $
1.7

The accumulated benefit obligation for all pension plans as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, was $
2.1
 billion and $
2.9
 billion, respectively.

For postretirement benefit measurement purposes, a 
6.1
% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the year ended December
31, 2021.

The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 
4.5
% by 
2031
 and remain at that level thereafter.  

Plan Assets

The Company’s employee benefit plan assets are principally comprised of the following types of investments:

Common stock:

Equity securities are valued based on quoted exchange prices and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Mutual funds:

Mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

Common collective trust (CCT) funds:

The fair values of the CCTs are valued using net asset value (NAV).  The investments in CCTs are comprised of U.S. and international equity, fixed income, and other securities.  The investments are valued at NAV provided by administrators of the funds.

Corporate debt instruments:

Corporate debt instruments are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S.

Treasury instruments:

U.S. Treasury instruments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which they are traded and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

U.S. government agency, state, and local government bonds:

U.S. government agency obligations and state and municipal debt securities are valued using third-party pricing services and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants’ methods, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of plan assets as of December

Level 3 Gains and Losses:

There are no Plan assets classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy; therefore there are no gains or losses associated with Level 3 assets.

The following table sets forth the actual asset allocation for the Company’s global pension plan assets as of the measurement date:

(1)

The Company’s U.S. pension plans contain approximately 
64

The actual asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans as of the measurement date consists of 
50
% equity securities and 
50
% debt securities.

The target asset allocation for the Company’s U.S. pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.  The actual asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans as of the measurement date consists of

% equity securities, 
17
% debt securities, and 
42
% other.

The target asset allocation for the Company’s foreign pension plans is approximately the same as the actual asset allocation.

Employee Benefit Plans (Continued)

Investment objectives for the Company’s plan assets are to:

•

Optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk.

•

Maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers.

•

Maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.

Asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of the pension plans.

Selection of the targeted asset allocation for plan assets was based upon a review of the expected return and risk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes.

The U.S. pension plans target asset allocation is also based on an asset and liability study that is updated periodically.

Investment guidelines are established with each investment manager.

These guidelines provide the parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements, and credit quality standards, where applicable.

In some countries, derivatives may be used to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner; however, derivatives may not be used to leverage the portfolio beyond the market value of underlying investments.

The Company uses external consultants to assist in monitoring the investment strategy and asset mix for the Company’s plan assets.

To develop the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets, the Company generally uses long-term historical return information for the targeted asset mix identified in asset and liability studies.

Adjustments are made to the expected long-term rate of return assumption when deemed necessary based upon revised expectations of future investment performance of the overall investment markets.

Contributions and Expected Future Benefit Payments

Based on actuarial calculations, the Company expects to contribute $
28
 million to the pension plans and
$
15
 million to the postretirement benefit plan during 2022.

The Company may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during this period.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the benefit plans:

Segment and Geographic Information (Continued)

The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, transportation, and storage of agricultural raw materials, and the crushing and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, rapeseed, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals. Oilseeds products produced and marketed by the segment include ingredients for food, feed, energy, and industrial customers. Crude vegetable oils produced by the segment’s crushing activities are sold “as is” to manufacturers of renewable green diesel and other customers or are further processed by refining, blending, bleaching, and deodorizing into salad oils. Salad oils are sold “as is” or are further processed by hydrogenating and/or interesterifying into margarine, shortening, and other food products. Partially refined oils are used to produce biodiesel and glycols or are sold to other manufacturers for use in chemicals, paints, and other industrial products. Oilseed protein meals are principally sold to third parties to be used as ingredients in commercial livestock and poultry feeds. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment is also a major supplier of peanuts and peanut-derived ingredients to both the U.S. and export markets. In North America, cotton cellulose pulp is manufactured and sold to the chemical, paper, and other industrial markets. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment’s grain sourcing, handling, and transportation network (including barge, ocean-going vessel, truck, rail, and container freight services) provides reliable and efficient services to the Company’s customers and agricultural processing operations. The Ag Services and Oilseeds segment also includes agricultural commodity and feed product import, export, and global distribution, and structured trade finance activities.  Structured trade finance’s activities include programs under which ADM prepays financial institutions, on a discounted basis, U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit based on underlying commodity trade flows.  This segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investment in Wilmar and its share of the results of its Pacificor, Stratas Foods LLC, Edible Oils Limited, Olenex, and SoyVen joint ventures.  In December 2021, the Company entered into a joint venture with Marathon Petroleum Corp. for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel. 

The Carbohydrate Solutions segment is engaged in corn and wheat wet and dry milling and other activities. The Carbohydrate Solutions segment converts corn and wheat into products and ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, corn and wheat starches, syrup, glucose, wheat flour, and dextrose.  Dextrose and starch are used by the Carbohydrate Solutions segment as feedstocks in other downstream processes.  By fermentation of dextrose, the Carbohydrate Solutions segment produces alcohol and other food and animal feed ingredients. Ethyl alcohol is produced by the Company for industrial use in products such as hand sanitizers and ethanol for use in gasoline due to its ability to increase octane as an extender and oxygenate. Corn gluten feed and meal, as well as distillers’ grains, are produced for use as animal feed ingredients. Corn germ, a by-product of the wet milling process, is further processed into vegetable oil and protein meal. Other Carbohydrate Solutions products include citric acids which are used in various food and industrial products.  The Carbohydrate Solutions segment has announced various memorandums of understanding with potential strategic partners leveraging our core production capabilities and carbon sequestration experience to facilitate the production of low carbon, bio-based products such as sustainable aviation fuel and innovative renewable chemicals.  This segment also includes the Company’s share of the results of its equity investments in Hungrana Ltd., Almidones Mexicanos S.A., Red Star Yeast Company, LLC, and Aston Foods and Food Ingredients.  In November 2021, the Company sold its ethanol production complex in Peoria, Illinois. 

The Nutrition segment serves various end markets including food, beverages, nutritional supplements, and feed and premix for livestock, aquaculture, and pet food.  The segment engages in the manufacturing, sale, and distribution of a wide array of ingredients and solutions including plant-based proteins, natural flavors, flavor systems, natural colors, emulsifiers, soluble fiber, polyols, hydrocolloids, probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, botanical extracts, and other specialty food and feed ingredients.  The Nutrition segment includes the activities related to the procurement, processing, and distribution of edible beans.  The segment also includes activities related to the processing and distribution of formula feeds and animal health and nutrition products and the manufacture of contract and private label pet treats and foods.  ADM acquired Golden Farm Production & Commerce Company Limited in April 2021, a 75% majority stake in PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, The Pound Bakery, and NutraDine (collectively, “P4”), premier providers of private label pet treats and supplements, in September 2021, U.S.-based Deerland Probiotics & Enzymes, a leader in probiotic, prebiotic, and enzyme technology, in November 2021, Sojaprotein, a leading European provider of non-GMO soy ingredients, in November 2021, and Flavor Infusion International, S.A., a full-range provider of flavor and specialty ingredient solutions for customers across Latin America and the Caribbean, in December 2021.

Under the Program, certain U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Receivables, LLC (“ADM Receivables”).  Prior to October 1, 2020, ADM Receivables transferred such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the First Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.

In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Receivables received a cash payment up to a certain amount and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  On October 1, 2020, the Company restructured the First Program from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure.  Under the new structure, ADM Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the First Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable.  In exchange, ADM Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $
1.6
 billion, an increase from $
1.2

billion, as of December 31, 2020 for the accounts receivable transferred.  The First Program terminates on May 18, 2022, unless extended. for the accounts receivables transferred.  

The Company also has an accounts receivable securitization program (the “Second Program”) with certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Second Purchasers”).  Under the Second Program, certain non-U.S.-originated trade accounts receivable are sold to a wholly-owned bankruptcy-remote entity, ADM Ireland Receivables Company (ADM Ireland Receivables).  Prior to April 1, 2020, ADM Ireland Receivables transferred such purchased accounts receivable in their entirety to the Second Purchasers pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement.  In exchange for the transfer of the accounts receivable, ADM Ireland Receivables received a cash payment up to a certain amount and an additional amount upon the collection of the accounts receivable (deferred consideration).  On April 1, 2020, the Company restructured the Second Program from a deferred purchase price to a pledge structure.  Under the new structure, ADM Ireland Receivables transfers certain of the purchased accounts receivable to each of the Second Purchasers together with a security interest in all of its right, title, and interest in the remaining purchased accounts receivable.  In exchange, ADM Ireland Receivables receives a cash payment of up to $
0.7
 billion (€
0.6
 billion) for the accounts receivables transferred.  The Second Program terminates on February 16, 2023, unless extended.

Sale of Accounts Receivable (Continued)

Under the First and Second Programs (collectively, the “Programs”), ADM Receivables and ADM Ireland Receivables use the cash proceeds from the transfer of receivables to the First Purchasers and Second Purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”) and other consideration, as applicable, to finance the purchase of receivables from the Company and the ADM subsidiaries originating the receivables.  The Company accounts for these transfers as sales.  The Company acts as a servicer for the transferred receivables.  At December
31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not record a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility, based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions, and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.   

As of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of trade receivables transferred to the Purchasers under the Programs and derecognized from the Company’s consolidated balance sheet was $
2.2

billion and $
1.6

billion, respectively.  Total receivables sold were $
50.3

billion, $
35.0

billion, and $
34.5

billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Cash collections from customers on receivables sold were $
47.3
 billion, $
34.2
 billion, and $
33.8
 billion for the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Of the amounts in 2020 and 2019, $
6.7
 billion and $
13.1
 billion were cash collections on the deferred consideration reflected as cash inflows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Receivables pledged as collateral to the Purchasers were $
0.5

billion and $
0.4

billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Transfers of receivables under the Programs during the years ended December
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 resulted in an expense for the loss on sale of $
11
 million, $
9
 million, and $
18
 million, respectively, which is classified as selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.

In accordance with the amended guidance of Topic 230, the Company reflects cash flows related to the deferred receivables consideration as investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows.  All other cash flows are classified as operating activities because the cash received from the Purchasers upon both the sale and collection of the receivables is not subject to significant interest rate risk given the short-term nature of the Company’s trade receivables.

Note 20.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is routinely involved in a number of actual or threatened legal actions, including those involving alleged personal injuries, employment law, product liability, intellectual property, environmental issues, alleged tax liability (see Note 13 for information on income tax matters), and class actions. The Company also routinely receives inquiries from regulators and other government authorities relating to various aspects of our business, and at any given time, the Company has matters at various stages of resolution.  The outcomes of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  In some actions, claimants seek damages, as well as other relief including injunctive relief, that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for material loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a material loss contingency is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded.  Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, disgorgement, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice.

Legal Proceedings (Continued)

On September 4, 2019, AOT Holding AG (“AOT”) filed a putative class action under the U.S. Commodities Exchange Act in federal district court in Urbana, Illinois, alleging that the Company sought to manipulate the benchmark price used to price and settle ethanol derivatives traded on futures exchanges.  On March 16, 2021, AOT filed an amended complaint adding a second named plaintiff Maize Capital Group, LLC (“Maize”).  AOT and Maize allege that members of the putative class suffered “hundreds of millions of dollars in damages” as a result of the Company’s alleged actions.  On July 14, 2020, Green Plains Inc. and its related entities (“GP”) filed a putative class action lawsuit, alleging substantially the same operative facts, in federal court in Nebraska, seeking to represent sellers of ethanol.  On July 23, 2020, Midwest Renewable Energy, LLC (“MRE”) filed a putative class action in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same operative facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act.  On November 11, 2020, United Wisconsin Grain Producers LLC (“UWGP”) and five other ethanol producers filed a lawsuit in federal court in Illinois alleging substantially the same facts and asserting claims under the Sherman Act and Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin law.  The court granted ADM’s motion to dismiss the MRE and UWGP complaints without prejudice on August 9, 2021 and September 28, 2021, respectively.  On August 16, 2021, the court granted ADM’s motion to dismiss the GP complaint, dismissing one claim with prejudice and declining jurisdiction over the remaining state law claim.  MRE filed an amended complaint on August 30, 2021, which ADM moved to dismiss on September 27, 2021.  UWGP filed an amended complaint on October 19, 2021, which ADM moved to dismiss on December 9, 2021.  On October 26, 2021, GP filed a new complaint in Nebraska federal district court, alleging substantially the same facts and asserting a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations.  The Company denies liability, and is vigorously defending itself in these actions. As these actions are in pretrial proceedings, the Company is unable at this time to predict the final outcome with any reasonable degree of certainty, but believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December
31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February
17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Fair Value Measurements over Certain Merchandisable Agricultural Inventory and Commodity Contracts

Description of the Matter

As explained in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory and inventory-related payables held by the Company are stated at fair value.  The Company also enters into forward commodity purchase and sales contracts that qualify as derivative instruments which are stated at fair value.  The merchandisable agricultural commodity inventory, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are considered level 2 and 3 fair value instruments.  As of December 31, 2021, the fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, forward commodity contracts in an asset position, and forward commodity contracts in a liability position were $9,769 million, $965 million, $1,362 million, and $1,759 million, respectively.    

Auditing the estimated fair values for merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts is complex due to the judgment involved in determining fair value, specifically related to determining the estimated basis adjustments, which represent the adjustment made to exchange quoted prices to arrive at the fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sales contracts.  The basis adjustments are impacted by specific local supply and demand characteristics at each facility and the overall market.  Factors such as substitute products, weather, fuel costs, contract terms, and futures prices also impact the basis adjustment. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s determination of the estimated fair values for certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts. Our tests included controls over the estimation process supporting the basis adjustments.  

To test the estimated fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural commodity inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating (i) the Company’s selection of the principal market, (ii) the inputs for the basis adjustments, and (iii) the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the basis adjustments.  For example, we evaluated management’s methodology for determining the basis adjustment including assessing the principal market identified and sources utilized by management to support the basis adjustment.  Specifically, we compared the basis adjustments used by management to competitor and broker quotations, trade publications, and/or recently executed transactions.  Further, we investigated, to the extent necessary, basis adjustments that were inconsistent with third party available information.  Finally, we evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures related to the estimated fair values of certain merchandisable agricultural inventories, inventory-related payables, and forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021, based on criteria established in 

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Pedigree Ovens, Inc., PetDine, LLC, The Pound Bakery, LLC, and NutraDine, LLC (P4); Deerland Holdings, Inc. (Deerland); and Sojaprotein D.O.O. Bečej (Sojaprotein),

which are included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 3% and 7% of total assets and shareholders' equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 0% and 1% of revenues and net earnings attributable to controlling interests, respectively, for the year then ended.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of P4, Deerland and Sojaprotein. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income (loss), shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2), and our report dated February
17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

104

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

[/TABLE]

As of December
31, 2021, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)).

Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

In 2018, the Company launched Readiness to drive new efficiencies and improve the customer experience in the Company’s existing businesses through a combination of data analytics, process simplification and standardization, and behavioral and cultural change, building upon its earlier 1ADM and operational excellence programs.  As part of this transformation, the Company is implementing a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.  The first phase of the ERP system implementation occurred in October 2021 to a limited pilot scope of legal entities.

The Company continues to consider these changes in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded, as part of the evaluation described in the above paragraph, that the implementation of the new ERP in these circumstances has not materially affected its internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).

The Company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021 based on the framework set forth in 

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework).  Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December
31, 2021.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of P4, Deerland, and Sojaprotein, which were acquired in 2021.  In accordance with the SEC guidance regarding the reporting of internal control over financial reporting in connection with an acquisition, management may omit an assessment of an acquired business’ internal control over financial reporting from management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition.  P4, Deerland, and Sojaprotein are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and constituted 3% and 7% of total assets and shareholders’ equity, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and 0% and 1% of revenues and net earnings attributable to controlling interests, respectively, for the year then ended.

Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2021.
