Modification of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants is subject to, among other things, Canopy shareholder approval of the modification of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and Canopy shareholder approval of its proposed transaction with Acreage.  Additional important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by our forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are those described in Item

PART I

Item 1.  Business.

Introduction

We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona, Modelo Especial, Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford, Meiomi and SVEDKA Vodka.  In the U.S., we are the number one sales growth driver at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers.  We are the third-largest beer company in the U.S. market and a leading, higher-end wine company in the U.S. market.  Many of our products are recognized as leaders in their respective categories.  This, combined with our strong market positions, makes us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers and on-premise locations.

Our vision is to elevate life with every glass raised and our mission is to build brands that people love.  We are committed to brand building, our trade partners, the environment, our investors and to consumers around the world who choose our products when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones.

Our key values are:

[TABLE]

•

people;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

customer focus;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

entrepreneurship;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

quality; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

integrity.

[/TABLE]

The Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December
4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.  We have approximately 

9,800

 employees located primarily in the U.S. and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York.  We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.

Strategy

Our overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth and shareholder value by building brands that people love when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones.  We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend toward premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories.

1

Table of Contents

To capitalize on premiumization trends, become more competitive and grow our business, we have generally employed a strategy focused on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with a focus on the higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry.  Key elements of our strategy include:

[TABLE]

•

leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and to provide for cross promotional opportunities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

investing in brand building and innovation activities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.

[/TABLE]

In the beer business, we have solidified our position in the U.S. beer market; enhanced our margins, results of operations and operating cash flow; and provided new avenues for growth.  We have made capital investments and acquisitions to increase beer production capacity to secure independence from a supply standpoint and to support the growth of the business.  Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we’ve made several acquisitions of high-quality, regional craft beer brands and leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends.

In our wine and spirits business, as part of our efforts to focus on higher-end brands, improve margins and create operating efficiencies, we have acquired higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands and portfolios of brands, including Meiomi, Prisoner and Charles Smith, and have strategically optimized the value of this business, particularly lower-margin, lower-growth products, with the divestiture of the Canadian wine business and the expected transaction, which was recently announced, to divest a portion of our wine and spirits business.  In addition, we have added higher-end brands to our spirits portfolio through the acquisitions of Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys.

Within our Corporate Operations and Other segment, we complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company.  These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing.

For further information on our strategy, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”).

Business Segments

We report our operating results in three segments:  (i)

Beer, (ii)

Wine and Spirits, and (iii)

Corporate Operations and Other.  The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.  We report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows:

Beer Segment

We are the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported, craft, domestic super premium, and alternative beverage alcohol categories.  We sell a number of brands in the high-end categories, driven largely by our imported Mexican beer portfolio.

Within the imported beer category, we have the exclusive right to import, market and sell these Mexican beer brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:

[/TABLE]

In the U.S., we are the leading imported beer company and have eight of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands.  Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the sixth best-selling beer overall in the U.S. and Modelo Especial is the second-largest and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand.

Since the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have more than tripled our production capacity in Mexico from 10
million to approximately 34
million hectoliters.  Our current production capacity provides us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market by increasing our investment behind on-trend innovation.  As part of these efforts, we successfully introduced Corona Premier, a lower-calorie, lower-carbohydrate product offering, which has become one of the top growth contributors in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market.  For Fiscal 2020, we are launching Corona Refresca nationally to capitalize on the growth of the high-end alternative beverage alcohol category.  Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing sales distribution of products in can, draft, single-serve and larger package size formats.

Expansion and construction efforts continue under our Mexico Beer Expansion Projects.  Since the June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested approximately $3.5
billion for the Mexico Beer Expansion Projects, with approximately $600
million during Fiscal
2019.  To align with our anticipated future 

3

Table of Contents

growth expectations, we are targeting an additional 10
million hectoliters of production capacity expansion activities to be completed over the next four fiscal years.

Our craft and specialty beer products are primarily sold under the Ballast Point brand.  Ballast Point is led by its popular Sculpin IPA.  In addition, the Funky Buddha and Four Corners acquisitions allow us to leverage our craft beer platform, capitalizing on the growth of high-quality, regional craft beer brands.  Overall, our craft and specialty beer capabilities further strengthen our position as the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market.

Wine and Spirits Segment

We are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands.  Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S., New Zealand and Chile, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy.  Our wine produced in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S.  In addition, we export our wine products to Canada and other major world markets.  Our spirits offerings include SVEDKA Vodka, which is imported from Sweden and is the largest imported vodka brand in the U.S.  Our higher-end spirits brands include Casa Noble tequila and High West craft whiskeys.

In the U.S., we have 18 of the 100 top-selling wine brands.  Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands, and portfolio of brands, sold in the U.S., which comprised our Fiscal 2019 U.S. Focus Brands (“Focus Brands”), included:

[/TABLE]

We dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to our Focus Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories.

We have been increasing resources in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth.  In wine, we have launched varietal line extensions behind many of our Focus Brands, such as Bourbon Barrel Aged Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Meiomi Rosé, and we have introduced newer brands like Derange, Spoken Barrel, Cooper & Thief and Crafters Union.  In spirits, we have introduced Mi CAMPO tequila.

In connection with our efforts to increase focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands, in April
2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities, for approximately $1.7 billion, subject to certain closing adjustments.  The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals (see “Recent Developments” in MD&A and Note 

23

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements).

Corporate Operations and Other

The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology, as well as our investments in Canopy and those made through our corporate venture capital function.

Table of Contents

Further information regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note

22

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Marketing and Distribution

To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service functions.  These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions and public relations.  Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.

In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)

our beer portfolio and (ii)

our wine and spirits portfolio, as well as state alcohol beverage control agencies.  As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state.  State governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products through the imposition of taxes or, in states in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices.

Trademarks and Distribution Agreements

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business.  We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license.  Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products and products of third parties.  These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.

Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S.  This sub-license agreement is perpetual.  Prior to our June 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, Crown Imports had exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of certain imported beer products and had an exclusive renewable sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the imported beer brands in the U.S.

Competition

The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive.  We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength.  Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention.  We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do.  Our principal competitors include:

[/TABLE]

Production

Our current production capacity in Mexico at our Nava and Obregon breweries is approximately 34
million hectoliters.  Prior to the acquisition of the Obregon Brewery, we entered into a three-year interim supply agreement with Modelo in June 2013, which was initially extended for one additional year through June 2017.  However, the purchase of the Obregon Brewery enabled us to become fully independent from this interim supply agreement, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition.  In addition, we are expanding the Obregon Brewery and constructing the Mexicali Brewery, located near California, which is our largest imported beer market in the U.S.  

5

Table of Contents

Based on our anticipated future growth expectations, we intend to expand our production capacity in Mexico to approximately 44
million hectoliters over the next four fiscal years.

Our craft beer production requirements are primarily fulfilled by our Miramar and Daleville facilities, located in the greater San Diego, California, and Roanoke, Virginia, areas, respectively.  These facilities can be expanded to accommodate future growth.  We also operate multiple tap rooms with smaller scale production and innovation capabilities.

In the U.S., we operate 

18

 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin regions of California.  We also operate 

three

 wineries in New Zealand and 

six

 wineries in Italy.  Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk.  The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest and are reduced prior to the subsequent year’s crush.  Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand.

Our Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our Canadian distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta.  We currently operate 

two

 facilities in the U.S. for the production of our High West whiskey brand.  The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.

Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for more than one year up to multiple years.  Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.

Sources and Availability of Production Materials

The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum and cardboard.

For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.  For 

Fiscal 2019

, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was 69% glass bottles, 28% aluminum cans and 3% in stainless steel kegs.

The Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers.  We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries’ on-going requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion activities.

As part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, the world’s largest glass container manufacturer.  The joint venture acquired a state-of-the-art glass production plant that is located adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico, in December 2014.  The glass plant currently has four operational glass furnaces and the joint venture intends to increase it to five furnaces by the end of calendar 2019.  When fully operational with five furnaces, the glass plant is expected to supply approximately 60% of our glass requirements for the Nava Brewery.  We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.

The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials (primarily glass).

Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand.  We receive grapes from approximately 

800

 independent growers in the U.S. and approximately 

165

 independent growers located primarily in New Zealand and Chile.  We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.

6

Table of Contents

As of 

February
28, 2019

, we owned or leased approximately 

20,500

 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand and Italy.  This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production.  However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines.  We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.

We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations.  However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.

The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market.  We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.

We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products.  After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold.  In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers.  We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations.  We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.

Government Regulation

We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities.  Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations.  We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control.

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Seasonality

The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category.  As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S.  Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.

Employees

As of 

February
28, 2019

, we had approximately 

9,800

 employees.  Approximately 

4,900

 employees were in the U.S. and approximately 

4,900

 employees were outside of the U.S., primarily in Mexico.  We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons.  Approximately 

21%

 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  Collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year are minimal.  We consider our employee relations generally to be good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations in future periods.

Operational Risks

International operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulations

Our products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries and we have production facilities currently in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada.

Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:

[TABLE]

•

changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

import and export requirements;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights, real property rights, and liability issues; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

[/TABLE]

Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.

10

Table of Contents

We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  We could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.

We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes or animus against the United States.  Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.

The U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts.  The U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or local regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects.  If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.

These international, economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Dependence on limited facilities for production of our Mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issues

We are dependent on our Nava and Obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our Mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near term.

We are currently expanding our Obregon Brewery and constructing our Mexicali Brewery, and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding its glass plant.  While these multi-million-dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.

Expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)

our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)

potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)

inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)

inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities.

We may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction or total destruction of the Nava or Obregon breweries or the glass plant, or 

11

Table of Contents

difficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the United States.  Also, if the contemplated expansions of the Obregon Brewery and the glass plant and construction of the Mexicali Brewery are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our Mexican beer to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our Mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at our Nava or Obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities or distribution systems

All of our Mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.  Many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The glass plant currently produces approximately half of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands.  Several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain California wineries and breweries and our planned Mexicali Brewery, are in areas prone to seismic activity.  Additionally, we have various vineyards, wineries and breweries in the state of California which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.

If any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties.  Also, our production facilities are asset intensive.  As our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, labor strike or other labor activities, cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made events.  If a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.

Our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If one or more significant uninsured or under-insured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.

Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottles

The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints.  In addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.

12

Table of Contents

We have substantial brewery operations in the country of Mexico, brewery operations in the states of California, Texas, Virginia and Florida, and we currently have substantial wine operations in the state of California as well.  In the past, California had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage.  A recurrence of severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Nava Brewery and glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Our Obregon Brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our Mexicali Brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer.  Although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future.

Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  These include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries.  Our breweries, wineries and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel in their operations.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.

Our breweries, wineries and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands.  In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer.

To the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies

Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the beer, wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies, and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits net sales.  Wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design and implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”)

We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have 

13

Table of Contents

experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware.  As with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.

We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  However, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations.

We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which we intend to replace our existing operating and financial systems in fiscal 2020 and 2021.  We are designing the ERP system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business.  We expect the implementation process will require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources.  Companies which implement new ERP systems may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties.  If we are not successful in designing and implementing our ERP system as planned or if it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, or we may not be able to operate our business.

To the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests and weather conditions

Our success depends upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and of the safety and quality of our products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  It is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.

Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.

If any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.

Climate change and environmental regulatory compliance

Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in California or a prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  Natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products. 

We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

The ability of Canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, Canopy’s compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and Canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products.  The laws and regulations governing medical and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee.  Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the U.S. and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law.  Even in those U.S. states in which the recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of U.S. federal law.  Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana would likely limit the expansion of Canopy’s business into the U.S.  Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries.  Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact negatively Canopy’s markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investments in Canopy.

We have the right to nominate four members of the Canopy board of directors.  While we do not control Canopy’s business or operations, we do rely on Canopy’s internal controls and procedures for operation of that business.  Nevertheless, our financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i)

Canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with Canadian laws in all material respects; (ii)

Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import and/or sell marijuana or any other controlled substance in or from the United States of America or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations; and (iii)

Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the United States of America or any other jurisdiction, in each case, 

15

Table of Contents

where such purchase, sale, manufacture or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations.  Were we to know that Canopy was knowingly or intentionally violating any of these applicable laws, we would be unable to make the required certification under our financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements.

Strategic Risks

Competition

We are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:

[TABLE]

•

our inability to maintain or increase prices;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

new entrants in our market or categories;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors’ products instead of ours; or

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.

[/TABLE]

Sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.

Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our Mexican beer brands

Our business depends upon consumers’ consumption of our beer, wine and spirits brands, and sales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. could adversely affect our business.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our beer, wine and spirits brands, and our Mexican beer brands in particular, from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:

[TABLE]

•

a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

inflation; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.

Acquisition, divestiture, investment, and new product development strategies

From time to time, we acquire businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business.  We integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.  We may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business.  In addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities or other potential synergies.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.

We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets.  Divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. Delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives.

We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery, our interest in Canopy, and investments made through our corporate ventures capital function.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests. 

We recently increased our investment in Canopy.  While we will not develop, distribute, manufacture or sell cannabis products in the U.S., or anywhere else in the world, unless it is legally permissible to do so at all governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.

In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.

We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or investments.  We also cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture or investment activities will be accurate.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Sale of a portion of our wine and spirits business

As previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities.  The divestiture of this portion of our business will enable us to focus on our higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands.  The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, and we cannot guarantee the transaction will 

17

Table of Contents

occur on the terms, conditions or timetable that we currently anticipate.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce our outstanding borrowings.  A delay in completing this transaction, or the failure to complete this transaction, could delay the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objectives.  Moreover, the Wine and Spirits Transaction will reduce the diversification of our portfolio.  We may not fully realize the expected benefits of a portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands.

Our Canopy investments are dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis products

The legal cannabis market is an emerging market.  The legislative framework pertaining to the Canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in other countries, is uncertain.  The success of the Canopy transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to create a strong platform for us to operate successfully in the cannabis market space.  There is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any Canopy products.

A failure in the demand for Canopy’s products to materialize as a result of competition, consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Were that to occur, we may have to write down the value of our investments in Canopy.  The changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.

For example, the Canadian 

Cannabis Act

 prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding and packaging that is appealing to youth.  The restrictions on advertising, marketing and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, and our investment in Canopy.

Additionally, Canopy must rely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts may not be fully available at this early stage in the cannabis industry in Canada and globally.  Market research relating to the adult-use recreational legal cannabis industry is in its early stages and, as such, trends can only be forecasted.

Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights

Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.

Financial Risks

Indebtedness

We have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities and repurchase shares of our common stock.  In the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.

18

Table of Contents

Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:

[TABLE]

•

our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or investments/acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.

[/TABLE]

Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings.  A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper.  Certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.

If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements.  In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instrument to be due and payable.  A default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.  If that were to occur, we might not have available funds to satisfy such repayment obligations.

Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks

We have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions

The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years.  Federal, state, provincial, local or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.

On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was signed into law in the United States.  The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results.

In addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions.  Our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions.  Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.  When tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.  Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.

Additional U.S. tax changes or in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Securities measured at fair value

The value of the warrants and convertible debt we hold in Canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock.  This volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility.  The market price of Canopy’s common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of Canopy, or of us.  These factors include, but are not limited to:

[TABLE]

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in Canopy’s reported results of operations;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

recommendations by securities analysts;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

changes in the market valuations of companies in the industry in which Canopy operates;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

announcement of developments and material events by Canopy or its competitors;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

addition or departure of Canopy executive officers or other key personnel;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and Canopy’s business and operations; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

administrative obligations associated with Health Canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the Canadian 

Cannabis Act

.

[/TABLE]

We recently agreed to modify the terms of certain warrants we hold in Canopy which, if modified, would among other things extend the expiry of those warrants and extend the time period through which the value of those warrants and our financial statements are subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock.

Canopy’s Corporate Governance

Canopy’s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both Canopy’s compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance.  These include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and the NYSE.  These rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for Canopy.  Canopy is currently exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements because it is a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE and registered with the SEC and is subject to Canadian requirements.  When Canopy registered with the SEC, it did not need to test its internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements pursuant to Section 404 of the 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002

 (“SOX”) that require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of Canopy’s internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report as to the effectiveness of such controls.  The future application of SOX to Canopy will require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of Canopy’s internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls.  Canopy has disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.  Canopy may not be able to remediate the material weakness timely.  Also, Canopy’s internal controls may not be adequate, or Canopy may not be able to maintain adequate internal controls as required by SOX.  Canopy may not be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time.  If Canopy does not satisfy SOX requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm Canopy’s business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of Canopy securities.

Other Risks

Damage to our reputation

The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for 

20

Table of Contents

our brands, could adversely affect their sales and our reputation.  Our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:

[TABLE]

•

a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, or cyber-security;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.

[/TABLE]

Failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.

Class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practices

There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Control by the Sands Family

Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of 

April

Overview

We are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred, high-end imported and craft beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands.  We are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market and a

leading, higher-end wine company in the U.S. market.  We are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) of beverage alcohol in the U.S., and a leading supplier of wine from New Zealand and Italy to North America.

Our internal management financial reporting consists of

two

business divisions:

(i)

Beer and (ii)

Wine and Spirits, and we report our operating results in

three

segments:

(i)

Beer, (ii)

Wine and Spirits, and (iii)

Corporate Operations and Other.  In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer brands.  We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the U.S. our Mexican beer portfolio.  In the Wine and Spirits segment, our portfolio includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands.  Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance,

corporate growth and strategy, 

human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology, as well as our investments in Canopy and those made through our corporate venture capital function.  All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments.  All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments.

The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

Strategy

Our overall strategy is to drive industry-leading growth and shareholder value by building brands that people love when celebrating big moments or enjoying quiet ones.  We position our portfolio to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization, which we believe will continue to result in faster growth rates in the higher-end of the beer, wine and spirits categories.  We focus on developing our expertise in consumer insights and category management as well as our strong distributor network, which provides an effective route-to-market.  Additionally, we leverage our scale across the total beverage alcohol market and our level of diversification hedges our portfolio risk.  In addition to growing our existing business, we focus on targeted acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses that are higher-margin, higher-growth, consumer-led, have a low integration risk and/or fill a gap in our portfolio.  We also strive to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics (see “Recent Developments” and “Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures 

–

 Canopy Investments” below).

We strive to strengthen our portfolio of higher-end beer, wine and spirits brands and differentiate ourselves through:

[TABLE]

•

leveraging our leading position in total beverage alcohol and our scale with wholesalers and retailers to expand distribution of our product portfolio and to provide for cross promotional opportunities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers by providing consumer and beverage alcohol insights;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

investing in brand building and innovation activities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

positioning ourselves for success with consumer-led products that identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

realizing operating efficiencies through expanding and enhancing production capabilities and maximizing asset utilization; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

developing employees to enhance performance in the marketplace.

[/TABLE]

Our business strategy for the Beer segment focuses on leading the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market and includes continued focus on growing our beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key 

26

Table of Contents

brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and continued expansion, construction and optimization activities for our Mexico beer operations.  Additionally, in an effort to more fully compete in growing sectors of the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, we’ve made several acquisitions of high-quality, regional craft beer brands and leveraged our innovation capabilities to introduce new brands that align with consumer trends.

In connection with our business strategy for the Beer segment, we have more than tripled the production capacity of our Nava Brewery since its June 2013 acquisition.  In addition, construction of the Mexicali Brewery is progressing and we are continuing to invest to expand the Obregon Brewery, which was acquired in December 2016.  Expansion, construction and optimization efforts continue under our previously-announced Mexico Beer Expansion Projects (as defined below in “Capital Expenditures”) to align with our anticipated future growth expectations (see “Capital Expenditures” below).

Our business strategy for the Wine and Spirits segment is to build an industry-leading portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands.  We are investing to meet the evolving needs of consumers; building brands through consumer insights, sensory expertise and innovation; and refreshing existing brands, as we continue to focus on moving our branded wine and spirits portfolio towards a higher-margin, higher-growth portfolio of brands.  We dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our U.S. Focus Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and generally hold strong positions in their respective price categories.  We focus our innovation and investment dollars on those brands within our portfolio which position us to benefit from the consumer-led trend towards premiumization.  Additionally, in connection with the Wine and Spirits Transaction, we expect to optimize the value of our wine and spirits portfolio by driving increased focus on our higher-end priority brands to accelerate growth and improve overall operating margins.  In markets where it is feasible, we entered into contractual arrangements to consolidate our U.S. distribution network in order to obtain dedicated distributor selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth.  This consolidated U.S. distribution network currently represents about 70%

of our branded wine and spirits volume in the U.S.  Throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors to essentially equal the distributors’ shipments to retailers.

Marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions.  In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with generally separate distribution networks utilized for (i)

our beer portfolio and (ii)

our wine and spirits portfolio.  The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.

Within our Corporate Operations and Other segment, we complemented our total beverage alcohol strategy in an adjacent category by making investments in Canopy, a world-leading, diversified cannabis company.  These investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing.

We remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth, maintain our targeted leverage ratio and pay quarterly cash dividends.

Recent Developments

Wine and Spirits Transaction

In April
2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities, for approximately 

$1.7 billion

, subject to certain adjustments.  The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval.  We expect to use the net cash proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.  We are in the process of 

27

Table of Contents

developing a plan to eliminate any remaining costs in the Wine and Spirits segment from the brands we are selling and expect to incur a restructuring charge for the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  We expect the Wine and Spirits Transaction to close around the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  The Wine and Spirits Transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.

We are selling approximately $1.3 billion in tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, in connection with the Wine and Spirits Transaction.  Selected financial information included in our results of operations for Fiscal 2019 for the portion of the wine and spirits business we expect to sell is as follows:

Canopy Warrants Modification

In April 2019, we agreed to modify the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and certain other rights.  Modification of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants is subject to, among other things, approval by Canopy’s shareholders.  These changes are a result of Canopy’s intention to acquire Acreage Holdings, Inc. upon U.S. Federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions.  We expect the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants to be accounted for at fair value.  If Canopy shareholder approval is received, we expect the modifications to the November 2018 Canopy Warrants will result in a fair value adjustment related to the warrants.  Additionally, we expect the fair value of the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants to be volatile in future periods.  For additional information regarding the Canopy warrants modification, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Investments, Acquisitions and Divestitures

Corporate Operations and Other Segment

Canopy Investments

Our investments in Canopy, and the method of accounting for these investments, consist of the following:

28

Table of Contents

We recognized an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of these investments accounted for at fair value in income from unconsolidated investments, as follows:

[TABLE]

(2)

I

ncludes 

$17.2 million

 of direct acquisition costs capitalized under the equity method cost accumulation model.  Excludes 

$7.3 million

 of direct acquisition costs associated with the investment in warrants which are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses.  See “Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources

 – 

General” for a discussion of financing for this transaction.

[/TABLE]

We expect the fair value of the Canopy investments accounted for at fair value to be volatile in future periods.  Equity in earnings (losses) for our Canopy Equity Method Investment are reported in the Corporate Operations and Other segment and are expected to be volatile in future periods.  Additionally, since November

1, 2018 we recognize equity in earnings (losses) for our Canopy Equity Method Investment on a two-month lag.  Accordingly, we recognized our share of Canopy’s losses from November and December 2018, which was included in Canopy’s third quarter fiscal 2019 results, in our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses.  Additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest.

As previously noted, these investments are consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, meet and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics, and they represent a significant expansion of our strategic relationship to position Canopy as a global leader in cannabis production, branding, intellectual property and retailing.

Beer Segment

Four Corners Acquisition

In July 2018, we acquired Four Corners, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and trademarks.  This acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market.  The results of operations of Four Corners are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Funky Buddha Acquisition

In August 2017, we acquired Funky Buddha, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill and trademarks.  This acquisition included a portfolio of high-quality, Florida-based craft beers which further strengthened our position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market.  The results of operations of Funky Buddha are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

29

Table of Contents

Obregon Brewery Acquisition

In December 2016, we acquired the Obregon Brewery, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, property, plant and equipment and inventories.  This acquisition provided us with immediate functioning brewery capacity to support our fast-growing, high-end Mexican beer portfolio and flexibility for future innovation initiatives.  It also enabled us to become fully independent from an interim supply agreement with Modelo, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition.  The results of operations of the Obregon Brewery are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Wine and Spirits Segment

Schrader Cellars Acquisition

In June 2017, we acquired Schrader Cellars, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, trademarks and certain grape supply contracts.  This acquisition included a collection of highly-rated, limited-production fine wines which aligned with our strategic focus on higher-end wine and spirits brands and strengthened our position in the fine wine category.  The results of operations of Schrader Cellars are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Canadian Divestiture

In December 2016, we sold our Canadian wine business, which included Canadian wine brands such as Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin, wineries, vineyards, offices, facilities and Wine Rack retail stores, at a transaction value of 

C$1.03 billion

, or 

$775.1 million

.  Accordingly, our consolidated results of operations include the results of operations of our Canadian wine business through the date of divestiture.  We received cash proceeds of 

$570.3 million

, net of outstanding debt and direct costs to sell.  We will continue to export certain of our brands into the Canadian market, which remains our largest export market.  This transaction is consistent with our strategic focus on higher-margin, higher-growth brands.  We recognized a net gain on the sale of the business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 of 

$262.4 million

.

Selected financial information included in our historical financial statements for 

Fiscal 2017

 that are no longer part of our results after the Canadian Divestiture is as follows:

Charles Smith Acquisition

In October 2016, we acquired Charles Smith, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, inventories and certain grape supply contracts.  This acquisition included a collection of five super and ultra-premium, high-quality Washington State wine brands with strong consumer affinity and demand.  The results of operations of Charles Smith are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Table of Contents

High West Acquisition

In October 2016, we acquired High West, which primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, trademarks, inventories and property, plant and equipment.  This acquisition included a portfolio of distinctive, award-winning, fast-growing and higher-end craft whiskeys and other select spirits.  The results of operations of High West are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Prisoner Acquisition

In April 2016, we acquired Prisoner, which primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, trademarks and certain grape supply contracts.  This acquisition, which included a portfolio of five higher-margin, fast-growing, super-luxury wine brands, aligned with our strategic focus on higher-end wine and spirits brands and strengthened our position in the super-luxury wine category.  The results of operations of Prisoner are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Financial Highlights for 

Fiscal 2019

:

[TABLE]

•

Our results of operations benefited primarily from continued improvements within the Beer segment, an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our investments in Canopy and a net gain on the sale of the Accolade Wine Investment.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Net sales

increased

7%

primarily due to an increase in Beer net sales driven predominantly by volume growth and a favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Operating income

increased

6%

largely

due to the net sales volume growth and favorable impact from pricing within our Mexican beer portfolio.  Operating income growth was tempered by planned increases in marketing spend and higher cost of product sold across both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments.

[/TABLE]

[TABLE]

•

Net income attributable to CBI and diluted net income per common share attributable to CBI 

increased

 significantly primarily due to the factors discussed above.

[/TABLE]

Comparable Adjustments

Management excludes items that affect comparability from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments.  Segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based on core segment operating income (loss).  As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.

31

Table of Contents

As more fully described herein and in the related Notes to the Financial Statements, the Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment results for each period are as follows:

Cost of Product Sold

Accelerated Depreciation

We recognized accelerated depreciation for certain assets primarily in connection with our current multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which is intended to replace our existing operating and financial systems.

Undesignated Commodity Derivative Contracts

Net gain (loss) on undesignated commodity derivative contracts represents a net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of undesignated commodity derivative contracts.  The net gain (loss) is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results.  At settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the results of our operating segments to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

Inventory Step-Up

In connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventories on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up.  Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired business prior to acquisition.

32

Table of Contents

Loss on Inventory Write-Down

We recognized a loss on the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires (Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018).

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Impairment of Intangible Assets

We recognized trademark impairment losses related to our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset (Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018) and certain of our Wine and Spirits trademark assets associated with our decision to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin U.S. brands (Fiscal 2017).  See “Costs Associated with the Canadian Divestiture and Related Activities” below for information about an additional impairment of intangible assets recognized in connection with the Canadian Divestiture.  For additional information, refer to Note 

7

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Net Loss on Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts Associated with Acquisition of Investment

We recognized a net loss in connection with the settlement of foreign currency option contracts entered into to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.

Restructuring and Other Strategic Business Development Costs

We recognized costs primarily in connection with the development of a program specifically intended to identify opportunities for further streamlining of processes and improving capabilities, linking strategy with execution, prioritizing resources and enabling a new enterprise resource planning system (Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018).

Deferred Compensation

We recognized an adjustment related to prior periods to correct for previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs associated with certain employment agreements.

Transaction, Integration and Other Acquisition-Related Costs

We recognized transaction, integration and other acquisition-related costs in connection with our acquisitions and investments.

Loss on Contract Termination

We recognized a loss in connection with the early termination of a beer glass supply contract with Owens-Illinois, a related-party entity with which we have an equally-owned joint venture which owns and operates a glass production plant located adjacent to our Nava Brewery.

Costs Associated with the Canadian Divestiture and Related Activities

We recognized costs in connection with the evaluation of the merits of executing an initial public offering for a portion of our Canadian wine business (Fiscal 2017) and net costs incurred in connection with the sale of the Canadian wine business (Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017).  In addition, in connection with the Canadian Divestiture, we recognized a trademark impairment loss for trademarks associated with certain U.S. brands within our Wine and Spirits portfolio sold exclusively through the Canadian wine business, for which future sales of these brands were expected to be minimal subsequent to the Canadian Divestiture (Fiscal 2017).

33

Table of Contents

Other Gains (Losses)

We recognized gains primarily in connection with the sale of certain non-core assets (Fiscal 2019) and the reduction in estimated fair value of a contingent liability associated with a prior period acquisition (Fiscal 2018).

Gain on Sale of Business

We recognized a net gain on sale of the Canadian wine business.

Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Investments

We recognized an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value (Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018), and a net gain in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment (Fiscal 2019).  For additional information, refer to Notes

Net Sales

Beer Segment

[TABLE]

(1)

Depletions represent distributor shipments of our respective branded products to retail customers, based on third-party data.

[/TABLE]

The 

increase

 in Beer net sales is primarily due to (i)

$446.5 million of volume growth within our Mexican beer portfolio, which benefited from continued consumer demand, increased marketing spend and new product introductions, and (ii)

a $102.8 million favorable impact from pricing in select markets within our Mexican beer portfolio.  Shipment volume growth outpaced depletion volume growth primarily due to timing.  We expect this shipment timing benefit to reverse during Fiscal 2020.

34

Table of Contents

Wine and Spirits Segment

Wine and Spirits net sales remained relatively flat as $21.4 million of lower branded wine and spirits volume and $16.2 million of unfavorable product mix shift were largely offset by a $35.5 million favorable impact from pricing.  As noted in the table above, the decline in the U.S. shipment volume was not as unfavorable as the decline in U.S. depletion volume.  As U.S. shipment volume should generally be aligned with U.S. depletion volume, we expect this timing difference to reverse primarily in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.  As a result, first quarter of fiscal 2020 net sales are expected to decrease 10% as compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Gross Profit

The 

increase

 in Beer is primarily due to $247.2 million of volume growth and the $102.8 million favorable impact from pricing, partially offset by $46.3 million of higher cost of product sold for our Mexican beer business.  The higher cost of product sold is predominantly due to $57.8 million of increased transportation costs, partially offset by $17.2 million of foreign currency transactional benefits within our Mexican beer portfolio.  The Beer segment also recognized higher operational costs for Fiscal 2019, largely attributable to higher depreciation, brewery maintenance and compensation and benefits; however, these costs were offset by brewery sourcing benefits.

The 

decrease

 in 

Wi

ne and Spirits is largely due to $37.4 million of higher cost of product sold and an unfavorable product mix shift of $26.3 million, partially offset by the $35.5 million favorable impact from pricing.  The higher cost of product sold is largely attributable to higher raw material costs, including grape, bulk wine and imported vodka costs, as well as increased transportation costs.

Gross profit as a percent of net sales remained flat for Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018 at 

50.3%

.  This was largely 

due to the

higher cost of product sold within both the Beer and Wine and Spirits segments, which resulted in approximately 25 basis points and 20 basis points of rate decline, respectively, partially offset by the favorable impact from Beer pricing in select markets, which contributed approximately 30 basis points of rate growth.

35

Table of Contents

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The 

increase

 in Beer is primarily due to an increase of $63.6 million in marketing spend and $33.7 million in general and administrative expenses.  The increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio, including support of the new product introductions.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by unfavorable foreign currency transaction losses and higher expenses supporting the growth of the business, including compensation and benefits associated primarily with increased headcount and information technology costs.

The 

decrease

 in Wine and Spirits is primarily due to a decrease of $18.2 million in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase of $12.0 million in marketing spend.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses is largely driven by certain cost savings initiatives.  The increase in marketing spend is primarily attributable to planned investment supporting the portfolio.

The 

increase

 in Corporate Operations and Other is due to higher general and administrative expenses driven predominantly by an increase of approximately $28 million in compensation and benefits largely attributable to supporting our growth initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales 

increased

 to 

20.6%

 for 

Fiscal 2019

 as compared with 

20.2%

 for 

Fiscal 2018

.  The increase is primarily attributable to the growth in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 30 basis points of rate growth.

Operating Income

The increase in Beer is primarily attributable to the strong net sales growth, partially offset by the planned increase in marketing spend and the higher cost of product sold.  The decrease in Wine and Spirits was driven by the higher cost of product sold and unfavorable product mix shift, partially offset by pricing.  As previously discussed, Corporate Operations and Other reduction in operating income is due largely to the higher costs supporting our growth initiatives.

Income from Unconsolidated Investments

Income from unconsolidated investments 

increased

 to 

$2,101.6 million

 for 

Fiscal 2019

 from 

$487.2 million

 for 

Fiscal 2018

, 

an increase

 of 

$1,614.4 million

.  This 

increase

 is driven largely by an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of 

$1,971.2 million

 for Fiscal 2019 as compared with an unrealized net gain of 

$464.3 million

 recognized for Fiscal 2018.  Fiscal 2019 also benefited from a net gain in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment of 

$99.8 million

.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased to 

$367.1 million

 for 

Fiscal 2019

 from 

$332.0 million

 for  

Fiscal 2018

, an increase of 

$35.1 million

, or 

11%

.  This increase is predominately due to higher average borrowings of approximately $2.0 billion.  The higher average borrowings are primarily attributable to the significant purchases of treasury stock for Fiscal 2018 and the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

Loss on extinguishment of debt for Fiscal 2018 consists of a make-whole payment of 

$73.6 million

 in connection with the early redemption of our April 2012 senior notes and the write-off of debt issuance costs of $23.4 million in connection with the May and November 2017 repayments of outstanding obligations under the European Term A loan facility and the U.S. Term A loan facility under our applicable senior credit facility, the July 2017 amendment and restatement of the 2016 Credit Agreement and the early redemption of our April 2012 senior notes.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for 

Fiscal 2019

 was 

16.5%

 as compared with 

1.0%

 for 

Fiscal 2018

 driven primarily by the recognition of a $351.2 million income tax benefit for Fiscal 2018 associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  For Fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit comprised primarily of benefits from (i)

the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii)

the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.  We completed our analysis of the income tax implications of the TCJ Act for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and recognized an additional income tax benefit of $37.6 million resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

For additional information, refer to Note

13

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

We expect our effective tax rate for the next fiscal year to be in the range of 16% to 18%.  This includes an estimated impact for (i)

benefits related to the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, (ii)

 lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses and (iii)

closing of the Wine and Spirits Transaction in accordance with the expected timeline.  Since estimates are not currently available, this range does not assume (i)

any future changes in the fair value of our Canopy investments measured at fair value, (ii)

any gain (loss) recognized in connection with the Wine and Spirits Transaction and (iii)

any equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment.

Net Income Attributable to CBI

Net income attributable to CBI 

increased

 to 

$3,435.9 million

 for 

Fiscal 2019

 from 

$2,303.4 million

 for 

Fiscal 2018

, 

an increase

 of 

$1,132.5 million

. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in income from unconsolidated investments discussed above.  Solid operating performance from Beer contributed an additional 

$202.7 million

 of operating income.  These increases were partially offset by the higher provision for income taxes discussed above.

the volume growth within our Mexican beer portfolio of $371.4 million, which benefited from continued consumer demand and increased marketing spend, and (ii)

a favorable impact from pricing in select markets within our Mexican beer portfolio of $78.1 million.

Wine and Spirits Segment

The 

decrease

 in Wine and Spirits net sales is due to the Canadian Divestiture of $311.2 million, partially offset by net sales from acquired brands of $50.4 million and organic net sales growth of $86.9 million.  The organic growth is due largely to favorable product mix shift of $129.5 million, partially offset by lower branded wine and spirits volume of $39.9 million driven predominantly by brands within our wine and spirits portfolio other than our Focus Brands.

Gross Profit

The 

increase

 in Beer is primarily due to (i)

the volume growth and the favorable impact from pricing in select markets within our Mexican beer portfolio of $190.2 million and $78.1 million, respectively, and (ii)

lower cost of product sold for our Mexican beer business of $140.5 million.  The lower cost of product sold is primarily due to operational and foreign currency transactional benefits within our Mexican beer portfolio of $89.6 million and $30.3 million, respectively.

The 

decrease

 in 

Wine and Spirits is

due to the Canadian Divestiture of $131.2 million, partially offset by organic gross profit growth of $62.2 million and gross profit from the acquired brands of $26.1 million.  The organic growth is due largely to

favorable product mix shift of $93.2 million, partially offset by higher

 branded wine and spirits cost of product sold

of $25.9 million.

Gross profit as a percent of net sales 

increased

 to 

50.3%

 for 

Fiscal 2018

 compared with 

48.1%

 for 

Fiscal 2017

 primarily 

due to

(i)

lower cost of product sold for the Beer segment, (ii)

the favorable impact from Beer pricing in select markets and (iii)

the favorable Wine and Spirits product mix shift, which contributed approximately 185 basis points, 55 basis points and 40 basis points of rate growth, respectively; partially offset by an unfavorable change in Comparable Adjustments, which resulted in approximately 60 basis points of rate decline.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The 

increase

 in Beer is primarily due to increases in marketing spend of $46.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $27.9 million.  The increase in marketing spend is due largely to planned investment to support the growth of our Mexican beer portfolio.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly driven by higher expenses supporting the growth of the business.  The 

decrease

 in Wine and Spirits is primarily driven by the Canadian Divestiture of $81.1 million, partially offset by an increase in marketing spend primarily due to planned investment to support our organic growth and acquired businesses of $32.4 million.  The 

increase

 in Corporate Operations and Other is due to higher general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to increases in consulting of $12.8 million and compensation and benefits of $11.0 million, both largely attributable to supporting the growth of the business.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 

20.2%

 for 

Fiscal 2018

 as compared with 

19.0%

 for 

Fiscal 2017

.  The increase is primarily attributable to
the unfavorable change in Comparable Adjustments and the growth in Corporate Operations and Other general and administrative expenses, which resulted in approximately 135 basis points of rate growth, partially offset by a benefit of approximately 25

Table of Contents

basis points from the divestiture of the Canadian wine business, which had a higher rate of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales as compared with the rest of the Wine and Spirits business.

Operating Income

Operating income growth in our Beer segment was driven predominantly by the factors discussed above.  Wine and Spirits remained relatively flat as the loss of operating income in connection with the divestiture of the Canadian wine business was offset by the growth factors discussed above.

Income from Unconsolidated Investments

Income from unconsolidated investments increased to 

$487.2 million

 for Fiscal 2018 from 

$27.3 million

 for Fiscal 2017, an increase of 

$459.9 million

.  This increase is driven largely by an unrealized net gain from the changes in fair value of our securities measured at fair value of 

$464.3 million

.

Interest Expense

Interest expense remained relatively flat for Fiscal 2018 as compared to Fiscal 2017 as a lower average interest rate of approximately 30 basis points was offset by higher average borrowings of approximately $645 million.  The lower average interest rate is predominantly due to the issuance of the lower rate December 2016 Senior Notes, May 2017 Senior Notes and November 2017 Senior Notes and the repayment of the higher rate August 2006 senior notes and January 2008 senior notes.  The higher average borrowings are primarily attributable to the purchases of businesses and treasury stock, net of proceeds from the Canadian Divestiture, during Fiscal 2017.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for 

Fiscal 2018

 was 

1.0%

 as compared with 

26.4%

 for  

Fiscal 2017

 driven primarily by the recognition of a $351.2 million income tax benefit for Fiscal 2018 associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017.  For Fiscal 2018, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit comprised primarily of benefits from (i)

the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii)

the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 as compared with Fiscal 2017 was also favorably impacted by:

[TABLE]

•

lower effective tax rates applicable to our foreign businesses;

•

the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled in connection with our March 1, 2017, adoption of FASB amended share-based compensation guidance; and

Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our ability to consistently generate cash flow from operating activities is one of our most significant financial strengths.  Our strong cash flows enable us to invest in our people and our brands, make appropriate capital investments, provide a quarterly cash dividend program, and from time-to-time, repurchase shares of our common stock and make strategic investments and acquisitions that we believe will enhance shareholder value.  Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operating activities.  Our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable.  Historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures.  Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which we use to fund our short-term borrowing requirements and to maintain our access to the capital markets.  We will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our commercial paper program, to support our working capital requirements and capital expenditures.

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt.  Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, anticipated dividend payments and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.

In November 2018, we completed the November 2018 Canopy Transaction for 

C$5,078.7 million

, or 

$3,869.9 million

.  In addition, we incurred 

$24.5 million

 of direct acquisition costs.  The aggregate cash paid at closing was financed with (i)

the net proceeds from the issuance of $2,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of October 2018 Senior Notes, (ii)

$1,500.0 million in term loans under the Term Credit Agreement and (iii)

the remainder from proceeds of borrowings under our commercial paper program.  Based on our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow from operating activities, we expect to be able to return to our targeted leverage ratio within 24 months following the close of this transaction, while continuing to make appropriate investments in our business that we believe will enhance shareholder value.

In April
2019, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business for approximately 

$1.7 billion

, subject to closing adjustments.  We expect to use the net cash proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings.

Cash Flows

Table of Contents

Operating Activities

Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018

The increase in net cash 

provided by

 operating activities for 

Fiscal 2019

 is largely due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven primarily by the segment’s solid operating results, including a benefit from decreased inventory levels due to strong shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.  Additionally, net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2019 benefited from lower income tax payments predominantly due to (i)

the receipt of a federal tax refund for Fiscal 2019 and (ii)

lower federal tax payments resulting from the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

The increase in net cash 

provided by

 operating activities for 

Fiscal 2018

 is primarily due to strong cash flow from the Beer segment driven largely by the segment’s strong operating results, partially offset by (i)

the timing of collections for recoverable value-added taxes and (ii)

an increase in cash outflow from accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments.  Net cash provided by operating activities also benefited from our March 1, 2017, adoption of the FASB amended share-based compensation guidance, which resulted in the classification of excess tax benefits (resulting from an increase in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or settlement date) as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity where they were previously presented prior to March 1, 2017.

Investing Activities

Fiscal 2019 Compared to Fiscal 2018

The increase in net cash 

used in

 investing activities for 

Fiscal 2019

 is primarily due to the November 2018 Canopy Transaction.  The increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by (i)

lower capital expenditures of 

$171.3 million

, (ii)

proceeds from the May 2018 sale of our Accolade Wine Investment of 

$110.2 million

 and (iii)

the lower level of business acquisition activity of 

$104.5 million

.

Fiscal 2018 Compared to Fiscal 2017

The decrease in net cash 

used in

 investing activities for 

Fiscal 2018

 is primarily due to the lower level of net business acquisition and divestiture activity of 

$380.6 million

.  The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the November 2017 Canopy Investment of 

$191.3 million

 and higher capital expenditures of 

$150.2 million

.

Business acquisitions consist primarily of the following:

Debt

Total debt outstanding as of

, amounted to 

$13,616.5 million

, 

an increase

 of 

$3,429.8 million

 from 

February
28, 2018

.  This increase was predominately due to the financing of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction, including the issuance of the October 2018 Senior Notes and borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement, partially offset by the conversion of 

$248.2 million

 from long-term debt to noncontrolling equity interests associated with the noncash settlement of a prior contractual agreement with our glass production plant joint venture partner.

Senior Credit Facility

In August 2018, we entered into the August 2018 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated our 2017 Credit Agreement, primarily for technical amendments. In September 2018, we entered into the 2018 Restatement Agreement that amended and restated the August 2018 Credit Agreement.  Among other things, the 2018 Restatement Agreement increased our revolving credit facility by 

$500.0 million

 to 

$2.0 billion

 and extended its maturity to September
14, 2023.  Additionally, the 2018 Restatement Agreement modified certain financial covenants and added various representations and warranties, covenants and an event of default in connection with the then-pending additional investment in Canopy.

General

The majority of our outstanding borrowings as of 

February
28, 2019

, consisted of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, with maturities ranging from calendar 2019 to calendar 2048, and variable-rate senior unsecured 

43

Table of Contents

term loan facilities under our 2018
Credit Agreement and Term Credit Agreement, with maturities ranging from calendar 2021 to calendar 2024.

Additionally, we have a commercial paper program which provides for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of 

$2.0 billion

 of commercial paper.  Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018
Credit Agreement.  Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018
Credit Agreement.

We do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper and, therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand.  If the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding commercial paper borrowings mature, we will utilize unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018
Credit Agreement to repay commercial paper borrowings.  We do not expect that fluctuations in demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity given our borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018
Credit Agreement.

We had the following borrowing capacity available under our 2018
Credit Agreement:

The financial institutions participating in our 2018
Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe such financial institutions will comply with any future funding requests.  However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so.

We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018
Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries that are not guarantors, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds.  The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio, both as defined in the 2018
Credit Agreement.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the minimum interest coverage ratio was 2.5x and the maximum net leverage ratio was 5.25x.

The obligations under the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  In addition, the representations, warranties, covenants and events of default set forth in the Term Credit Agreement are substantially similar to those set forth in the 2018 Credit Agreement.

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:

(i)

a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)

a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions, and (iii)

restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Term Credit Agreement and our indentures, and have met all debt payment obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Capital Expenditures

During 

Fiscal 2019

, we incurred 

$886.3 million

 for capital expenditures, including 

$720.0 million

 for the Beer segment primarily for (i)

our Nava Brewery and glass production plant expansions, (ii)

our Obregon Brewery optimization and expansion and (iii)

our Mexicali Brewery construction (collectively, the “Mexico Beer Expansion Projects”).  Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs.  We plan to spend from 

$800.0 million

 to 

$900.0 million

 for capital expenditures for 

Fiscal 2020

, including approximately 

$750.0 million

 for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Mexico Beer Expansion Projects.  The remaining Fiscal 2020 capital expenditures consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings.  The Mexico Beer Expansion Projects are expected to be completed over the next four fiscal years.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices.  We intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions.  There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.  In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 

1

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.  However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.  In applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates.  Those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business.  Our critical accounting estimates include:

[TABLE]

•

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

  We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories:  (i)

intangible assets with definite lives subject to 

[/TABLE]

46

Table of Contents

amortization, (ii)

intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization and (iii)

goodwill.  For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired.  We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January
1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment or change in useful life might exist.  The guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing a quantitative impairment test.  Under the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, including goodwill.  The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally calculated based on an income approach using the discounted cash flow method supplemented by the market approach.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a goodwill impairment will be recognized. The amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.  Our reporting units with goodwill include the Beer segment and the Wine and Spirits segment.  In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors.  The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are based on historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans.  These assumptions reflect management’s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets.  The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

In the fourth quarter of 

fiscal 2019

, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis using the qualitative assessment.  Our decision to utilize the qualitative assessment was based primarily on the significant amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount of goodwill for our reporting units noted in the prior year assessment. 

As part of the qualitative assessment, we first identified the key drivers of fair value used in the prior year valuations for each of the reporting units noting that the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations were: (i)

the discount rate, (ii)

the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)

the annual cash flow projections. We then evaluated whether those drivers had subsequently been affected by events and circumstances that could have positive, negative or neutral impacts on the valuation inputs.  No indication of impairment was noted for either of our reporting units; therefore, no quantitative assessment was performed.  For 

Fiscal 2018

 and 

Fiscal 2017

, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analyses, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for either of our reporting units.

We performed sensitivity analyses on our qualitative assessment for each reporting unit, by updating the reporting unit’s carrying value for all assets and liabilities, as well as prior year’s estimated fair value, using actual reporting unit operating results for Fiscal 2019, with any forecast versus actual variances carried through estimated future periods. These analyses further supported our qualitative conclusion of no indication of impairment for either of our reporting units.

Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions.  Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  The trademarks that were determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized.  The guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.  Under the quantitative assessment, our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value.  The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method.  The 

47

Table of Contents

estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value.  In estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors.  The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans.  These assumptions reflect management’s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss for these assets.  The recognition of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we performed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis utilizing the qualitative assessment for our import beer, total wine and total spirits trademark assets and the quantitative assessment for the Ballast Point and Funky Buddha trademark assets.  Our decision to utilize the qualitative assessment for the import beer, total wine and total spirits trademark assets was based primarily on the significant amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount for the trademark assets noted in the prior year assessment.  No indication of impairment was noted for any of the trademark assets tested under the qualitative assessment.  As the aforementioned more likely than not criteria was not met, no quantitative assessment was performed.  Additionally, under the quantitative assessment, no indication of impairment was noted for the Funky Buddha trademark asset.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Beer segment’s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 

$108.0 million

 in connection with certain continuing negative trends within its craft beer portfolio and a change in strategy for this portfolio focused on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Beer segment’s Ballast Point business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 

$86.8 million

 in connection with certain negative trends within its craft beer portfolio.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Wine and Spirits’ U.S. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 

$37.6 million

 in connection with our decision to discontinue certain small-scale, low-margin U.S. brands.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Wine and Spirits’ U.S. business recognized a trademark impairment loss of 

$8.4 million

 in connection with certain U.S. brands sold exclusively through the Canadian wine business, for which we expect future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the Canadian Divestiture (refer to Note 

7

 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for further discussion). 

The most significant assumptions used in the relief from royalty method to determine the estimated fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:

(i)

the estimated royalty rate, (ii)

the discount rate, (iii)

the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)

the annual revenue projections.  As of 

January
1, 2019

, if we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual revenue projections that were 100 basis points lower in our impairment testing of the Funky Buddha trademark, then each change individually would not have resulted in its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value.

Accounting for income taxes. 

 We estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities, income taxes payable, provision for income taxes and unrecognized tax benefit liabilities based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of various items of income and expense, interpretation of tax laws and tax planning strategies.  We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We are regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, but a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which we have unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, is audited and finally resolved.

[/TABLE]

Table of Contents

We believe that all tax positions are fully supported.  However, we recognize tax assets and liabilities in accordance with the FASB guidance for income tax accounting.  Accordingly, we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination.  We measure and recognize the tax benefit from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.  In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.  These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.  Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our results of operations.  If necessary, we recognize a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized.  We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  The realization of deferred tax assets is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction.  We believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our existing deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.  Changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets will be reflected in our effective tax rate in the period in which they are determined.

Accounting Guidance

Accounting guidance adopted for Fiscal 2019 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  For additional information on recently adopted accounting guidance and accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to Note

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

As a result of our global operating, acquisition and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices.  To manage the volatility relating to these risks, we periodically purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts.  We use derivative instruments to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates, as well as to hedge economic exposures.  We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency and Commodity Price Risk

Foreign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with acquisitions, divestitures or investments outside the U.S.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, New Zealand dollar and Canadian dollar.  Approximately 

80%

 of our balance sheet exposures and forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending 

February
29, 2020

, were hedged as of 

February
28, 2019

.

Commodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas and wheat prices.  Approximately 

75%

 of our forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending 

February
29, 2020

, were hedged as of 

February
28, 2019

.

Table of Contents

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market.  The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.  Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or losses on the derivative instruments.  The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

The estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.  In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, we had no interest rate swap contracts outstanding.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates.  The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.  The aggregate notional value, estimated fair value and sensitivity analysis for our outstanding fixed and variable interest rate debt, including current maturities, are summarized as follows:

Equity Price Risk

The estimated fair value of our investments in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities are subject to equity price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.  These investments are recognized at fair value utilizing various option-pricing models and have the potential to fluctuate from, among other items, changes in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security.  We manage our equity price risk exposure by closely monitoring the financial condition, performance and outlook of Canopy Growth Corporation.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, the fair value of our investments in the Canopy warrants and the Canopy convertible debt securities was $3,234.7 million, with an unrealized net gain on these investments of $1,678.7 million recognized in our results of operations for the year ended 

February
28, 2019

.  We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of the equity price reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the quoted market price of the underlying equity security.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, such a hypothetical 10% adverse change would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $438.3 million.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting.  This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.  Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of 

February

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

[TABLE]

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

[/TABLE]

Description of business –

Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “CBI,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  We are an international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred, high-end imported and craft beer brands, and higher-end wine and spirits brands.

Basis of presentation –

Principles of consolidation:

Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  In addition, we have an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois.  The joint venture owns and operates a state-of-the-art glass production plant which provides bottles exclusively for our brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico (the “Nava Brewery”).  We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of this variable interest entity and accordingly, the results of operations of the joint venture are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations.  All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

Equity method investments:

If we are not required to consolidate our investment in another entity, we use the equity method when we (i)

can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii)

hold common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity.  Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus our equity in the increases and decreases in the investee’s net assets after the date of acquisition.  We monitor our equity method investments for factors indicating other-than-temporary impairment.  Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

Management’s use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Summary of significant accounting policies –

Revenue recognition:

Effective March
1, 2018, we adopted the FASB amended guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers using the retrospective application method (see “Recently adopted accounting guidance

 –

 Revenue recognition” below for impacts of adoption).  Our revenue (referred to in our financial statements as “sales”) consists primarily of the sale of beer, wine and spirits domestically in the U.S.  Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed-upon credit terms.  Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant.  Our customers consist primarily of wholesale distributors.  Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms.  Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product.  Our sales terms do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part.  Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in sales.

As noted, the majority of our revenues are generated from the domestic sale of beer, wine and spirits to wholesale distributors in the U.S.  Our other revenue generating activities include the export of certain of our products to select international markets, as well as the sale of our products through state alcohol beverage control 

61

Table of Contents

agencies and on-premise, retail locations in certain markets.  We have evaluated these other revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the amended guidance and concluded that these other revenue generating activities are immaterial for separate disclosure.  See Note 

22

 for disclosure of net sales by product type.

Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons and rebates.  This variable consideration is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized.  For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time.  The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors’ sales to retailers.  Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer.  The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recognized.  We estimate this variable consideration by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.

Excise taxes remitted to tax authorities are government-imposed excise taxes on our beverage alcohol products. Excise taxes are shown on a separate line item as a reduction of sales and are recognized in our results of operations when the related product sale is recognized.  Excise taxes are recognized as a current liability in other accrued expenses and liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority.

Cost of product sold:

The types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs).  Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

The types of costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs.  Distribution network costs are included in cost of product sold.  We expense advertising costs as incurred, shown or distributed.  Advertising expense for the years ended 

February
28, 2019

, 

February
28, 2018

, and 

February
28, 2017

, was 

$700.8 million

, 

$615.7 million

 and 

$552.8 million

, respectively.

Foreign currency translation:

The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally the respective local currency.  The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period.  The resulting translation adjustments are recognized as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“AOCI”).  Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Cash and cash equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Fair value of financial instruments:

We calculate the estimated fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available.  When quoted market prices are not available, we use standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps and convertible debt) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 

7

).

62

Table of Contents

Derivative instruments:

We enter into derivative instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.  We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges.  We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at estimated fair value (see Note 

6

 and Note 

7

).  We present our derivative positions gross on our balance sheets.

Effective March 1, 2018, we adopted FASB guidance which amends, among other items, the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness for outstanding cash flow hedges.  Accordingly, the entire change in the fair value of outstanding cash flow hedges is deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI prospectively from the date of adoption.  For the years ended February
28, 2018, and February
28, 2017, changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow hedges deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI consisted only of amounts deemed effective, with ineffectiveness associated for these derivative instruments recognized immediately in our results of operations for the applicable period.  For all periods presented herein, gains or losses deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of AOCI are recognized in our results of operations in the same period in which the hedged items are recognized and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged items.

Changes in fair values for derivative instruments not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recognized directly in our results of operations each period and on the same financial statement line item as the hedged item.  For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of our undesignated commodity derivative contracts, prior to settlement, is reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is recognized in the segment operating results.  Upon settlement, the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of the undesignated commodity derivative contracts is reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segment results to reflect the economic effects of the commodity derivative contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear on our statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged items.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.  Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead.

Bulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than one year.  A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the duration of the aging process.  All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice.  Warehousing, insurance, value added taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.

We assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.  Major additions and improvements are recognized as an increase to the property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the balance sheet accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income.

63

Table of Contents

Depreciation:

Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides.  A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  We use January
1 as our annual impairment test measurement date.  Indefinite lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks.  Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Note 

9

 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.

Indemnification liabilities:

We have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures.  Indemnification liabilities are recognized when probable and estimable and included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities (see Note 

15

).

Income taxes:

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  We provide for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were to be remitted to the U.S., except for those earnings that we consider to be indefinitely reinvested (see Note 

13

).  Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of provision for income taxes.

Net income per common share attributable to CBI:

We have 

two

classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding:

Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (see Note 

16

).  In addition, we have another class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding:

Class 1 Common Stock (see Note 

16

).  If we pay a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 

ten

 percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any time at the option of the holder.

We use the two-class method for the computation and presentation of net income per common share attributable to CBI (hereafter referred to as “net income per common share”) (see Note 

18

).  The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that calculates basic and diluted net income per common share for each class of common stock separately based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period.  Under the two-class method, Class A Common Stock is assumed to receive a ten percent greater participation in undistributed earnings than Class B Convertible Common Stock, in accordance with the respective minimum dividend rights of each class of stock.

Net income per common share – basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the two-class method.  Net income per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Net income per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the 

64

Table of Contents

more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class method.  Net income per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock is computed using the if-converted method and assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock as this method is more dilutive than the two-class method.  Net income per common share – diluted for Class B Convertible Common Stock is computed using the two-class method and does not assume conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock into shares of Class A Common Stock.

Stock-based employee compensation:

We have 

two

 stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 

17

).  We apply grant date fair-value-based measurement methods in accounting for our stock-based payment arrangements and recognize all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions, net of expected forfeitures, ratably over the requisite service period.  Stock-based awards are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability or death of the employee (as defined by the plan), if earlier.  For awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, we recognize compensation expense ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility.

Recently adopted accounting guidance –

Revenue recognition:

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance regarding the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.  Under this guidance, an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Additionally, this guidance requires improved disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

We adopted this guidance on March
1, 2018, using the retrospective application method to allow for comparable reporting in all periods throughout the year ending February
28, 2019.  Based on our analysis, we concluded that the adoption of the amended guidance did not have a material impact on our net sales recognition.  However, the broad definition of variable consideration under this guidance requires us to estimate and recognize certain variable payments resulting from various sales incentives earlier than we have historically recognized them.  This change in the timing of when we recognize sales incentives resulted in a shift in net sales recognition primarily between our fiscal quarters.  Under the retrospective application method, we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with a reduction to our March
1, 2016, opening retained earnings of 

$49.0 million

, net of income tax effect, with an offsetting increase to current accrued promotion expense and the recognition of a deferred tax asset to align the timing of when we recognize sales incentive expense and when we recognize revenue.

The effects of the retrospective application method on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented in this report are as follows:

65

Table of Contents

The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance had 

no

 impact to cash flows from operating, financing or investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended February
28, 2018, and February
28, 2017.

Income taxes:

In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance that simplifies the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.  Under this guidance, an entity is required to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs.  Prior guidance prohibited the recognition in earnings of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer until the asset had been sold to an outside party or recovered through use.

We adopted this guidance on March
1, 2018, using the modified retrospective basis, which requires a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  Based on our assessment of intra-entity asset transfers that are in scope and the related deferred income taxes, we recognized the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 with a net increase to our March
1, 2018, opening retained earnings and deferred tax assets of approximately 

$2.2 billion

, primarily in connection with the intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property related to our imported beer business for the year ended February
28, 2018.  In connection with a change in forecast within that business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized a tax benefit of 

$50.1 million

 from the reversal of a valuation allowance established in connection with the adoption of this guidance on March 1, 2018.

Leases:

In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance for the accounting for leases.  Under this guidance, a lessee will recognize assets and liabilities on its balance sheet for most leases, but will recognize expense similar to current lease accounting guidance.  Additionally, this guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements.

We adopted this guidance on March
1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach.  We will apply the transition method which does not require adjustments to comparative periods or require modified disclosures for those comparative periods for Fiscal 2020.  The guidance provides a number of optional practical expedients in 

66

Table of Contents

transition.  We have elected all of the available transition practical expedients, other than the use-of-hindsight.  We are finalizing the implementation of changes to our accounting policies, systems and controls, including the implementation of new leasing software capable of producing the required data for accounting and disclosure purposes.  The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity.  We expect to recognize new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities associated with our operating leases of approximately 

$600.0 million

 to 

$650.0 million

 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.

The guidance also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting.  We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption which allows us to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.  We have also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of our leases.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES:

Acquisitions –

Obregon Brewery:

In December 2016, we acquired a brewery operation business in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico from Grupo Modelo, S. de R.L. de C.V., formerly known as Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V., (“Modelo”), a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV for cash paid of 

$569.7 million

, net of cash acquired

(the “Obregon Brewery”).  The transaction primarily included the acquisition of operations; goodwill; property, plant and equipment; and inventories.  This acquisition provided us with immediate functioning brewery capacity to support our fast-growing, high-end Mexican beer portfolio and flexibility for future innovation initiatives.  It also enabled us to become fully independent from an interim supply agreement with Modelo, which was terminated at the time of this acquisition.  The results of operations of the Obregon Brewery are reported in the Beer segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Charles Smith:

In October 2016, we acquired the Charles Smith Wines, LLC business, a collection of five super and ultra-premium wine brands, for 

$120.8 million

 (“Charles Smith”).  This transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, trademarks, inventories and certain grape supply contracts, plus an earn-out over three years based on the performance of the brands.  The results of operations of Charles Smith are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

High West:

In October 2016, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common and preferred membership interests of High West Holdings, LLC for 

$136.6 million

, net of cash acquired (“High West”).  This transaction primarily included the acquisition of operations, goodwill, trademarks, inventories and property, plant and equipment.  This acquisition included a portfolio of craft whiskeys and other select spirits.  The results of operations of High West are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Prisoner:

In April 2016, we acquired The Prisoner Wine Company business, including a portfolio of five super-luxury wine brands, for 

$284.9 million

 (“Prisoner”).  This transaction primarily included the acquisition of goodwill, inventories, trademarks and certain grape supply contracts.  The results of operations of Prisoner are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Other Acquisitions:

During the year ended February
28, 2019, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Four Corners Brewing Company LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, dynamic and bicultural, Texas-based craft beers (“Four Corners”), and a business in Italy, which provided additional processing and sourcing capabilities for our Italian wine portfolio.  The purchase price for the Four Corners acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and trademarks, plus an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands.  The purchase price for the acquired business in Italy was primarily 

67

Table of Contents

allocated to a production facility, vineyards and inventory.  The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.

During the year ended February
28, 2018, we completed the acquisitions of other businesses, including the Funky Buddha Brewery LLC business, which included a portfolio of high-quality, Florida-based craft beers (“Funky Buddha”), and the Schrader Cellars, LLC business, which included a collection of highly-rated, limited-production fine wines (“Schrader Cellars”).  The total combined purchase price for these acquisitions was 

$149.8 million

.  The purchase price for each acquisition was primarily allocated to goodwill and trademarks.  In addition, the purchase price for Funky Buddha includes an earn-out over five years based on the performance of the brands.  The results of operations of these acquired businesses are reported in the respective segment and have been included in our consolidated results of operations from their respective date of acquisition.

Divestitures –

Sale of Accolade Wine Investment:

In May 2018, we completed the sale of our remaining interest in our previously-owned Australian and European business (the “

Accolade Wine Investment”)

for 

A$149.1 million

, or 

$113.6 million

, subject to closing adjustments.  We received cash proceeds, net of direct costs to sell, of 

$110.2 million

 and a note receivable of 

$3.4 million

.  This interest consisted of an investment accounted for under the cost method and AFS debt securities.  For the year ended February 28, 2019, we recognized a net gain of 

$99.8 million

 in connection with this transaction.  This net gain is included in income from unconsolidated investments.

Canadian Divestiture:

In December 2016, we sold the Wine and Spirits Canadian wine business, which included Canadian wine brands such as Jackson-Triggs and Inniskillin, wineries, vineyards, offices, facilities and Wine Rack retail stores, at a transaction value of 

C$1.03 billion

, or 

$775.1 million

 (the “Canadian Divestiture”).  We received cash proceeds of 

$570.3 million

, net of outstanding debt and direct costs to sell of 

$194.9 million

 and 

$9.9 million

, respectively.  The following table summarizes the net gain recognized in connection with this divestiture:

Additionally, our Wine and Spirits U.S. business recognized an impairment of 

$8.4 million

 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for trademarks associated with certain U.S. brands sold exclusively through the Canadian wine business for which we expected future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the Canadian Divestiture.  We have also recognized 

$15.2 million

 of other costs associated with the Canadian Divestiture, with 

$12.0 million

 recognized for the year ended February
28, 2017, primarily in connection with the evaluation of the merits of executing an initial public offering for a portion of our then-owned Canadian wine business, and 

$3.2 million

 recognized for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the sale of the Canadian wine business.  These amounts are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  In total, we have recognized 

$238.8 million

 of net gains associated with the Canadian Divestiture, with 

$242.0 million

 of net gains recognized for the year ended February 28, 2017, and 

$3.2 million

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:

Overview –

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices that could affect our results of operations and financial condition.  The impact on our results and financial position and the amounts reported in our financial statements will vary based upon the currency, commodity, interest rate and equity market movements during the period, the effectiveness and level of derivative instruments outstanding and whether they are designated and qualify for hedge accounting.

The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices, interest rates and/or equity prices and are expected to offset changes in the values of the 

69

Table of Contents

underlying exposures.  Our derivative instruments are held solely to manage our exposures to the aforementioned market risks as part of our normal business operations.  We follow strict policies to manage these risks and do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  

We have investments in certain equity securities which provide us with the option to purchase an additional ownership interest in the equity securities of that issuer (see Note 

10

).  These investments are included in securities measured at fair value and are accounted for at fair value, with the net gain (loss) from the changes in fair value of these investments recognized in income (loss) from unconsolidated investments (see Note 

7

).

The aggregate notional value of outstanding derivative instruments is as follows:

Cash flow hedges –

Our derivative instruments designated in hedge accounting relationships are designated as cash flow hedges.  We are exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations primarily in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases.  We primarily use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain of these risks.  In addition, we utilize interest rate swap contracts periodically to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates.  Derivatives managing our cash flow exposures generally mature within 

three years

 or less, with a maximum maturity of 

five years

.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured.  The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the risk being hedged.  Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed based on quantitative and qualitative measures.  All components of our derivative instruments’ gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

When we determine that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.  In the event the relationship is no longer effective, we recognize the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately in our results of operations.  We also discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i)

a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii)

it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii)

we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.  When we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but the original forecasted transaction continues to be probable of occurring, the existing gain or loss of the derivative instrument remains in AOCI and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs.  When it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any remaining gain or loss in AOCI is recognized immediately in our results of operations.

We expect 

$11.8 million

 of net gains, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to our results of operations within the next 12 months.

Table of Contents

Undesignated hedges –

Certain of our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; for others, we choose not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment.  These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries and foreign-denominated investments, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, including aluminum, corn, diesel fuel, natural gas and wheat prices.  We primarily use foreign currency forward and option contracts, generally less than 

12 months

 in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than 

36 months

 in duration, with a maximum maturity of 

five years

, to hedge some of these risks.  In addition, from time to time, we utilize interest rate swap contracts, generally less than 

six months

 in duration, to economically hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates associated with the financing of significant investments and acquisitions.  Our derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management.

Credit risk –

We are exposed to credit-related losses if the counterparties to our derivative contracts default.  This credit risk is limited to the fair value of the derivative contracts.  To manage this risk, we contract only with major financial institutions that have earned investment-grade credit ratings and with whom we have standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which allow for net settlement of the derivative contracts.  We have also established counterparty credit guidelines that are regularly monitored.  Because of these safeguards, we believe the risk of loss from counterparty default to be immaterial.

In addition, our derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the estimated fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was 

$3.4 million

.  If we were required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on 

February
28, 2019

, we would have had sufficient available liquidity on hand to satisfy this obligation.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

Authoritative guidance establishes a framework for measuring fair value, including a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.  The hierarchy includes three levels:

[TABLE]

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly; and

[/TABLE][TABLE]

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

[/TABLE]

Fair value methodology –

The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value for each class of our financial instruments:

Foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts:

The fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, into valuation models.  These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, market commodity prices, interest-rate yield curves and currency volatilities, as applicable (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Canopy investments:

Equity securities, Common stock

 – 

The fair value of the November 2017 Canopy Investment (as defined in Note 

10

) is calculated through the date of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction (as defined in Note 

10

) by using the closing market price of the underlying equity security (Level
1 fair value measurement).  As of the date of the November 2018 Canopy Transaction, the November 2017 Canopy Investment, collectively with the November 2018 Canopy Investment (as defined in Note 

10

), is accounted for under the equity method (see Note 

10

).

Equity securities, Warrants

 – 

The fair value of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the November 2018 Canopy Warrants (both as defined in Note 

10

) is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Level
2 fair value measurement).  The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the warrants are as follows:

Debt securities, Convertible

 – 

In June 2018, we acquired convertible debt securities issued by Canopy for  

C$200.0 million

, or 

$150.5 million

 (the “Canopy Debt Securities”).  We have elected the fair value option to account for the Canopy Debt Securities, which, at that time, provided the greatest level of consistency with the accounting treatment for the November 2017 Canopy Warrants.  Interest income on the Canopy Debt Securities is calculated using the effective interest method and is recognized separately from the changes in fair value in interest expense.  The Canopy Debt Securities have a contractual maturity of five years from the date of issuance, but may be converted prior to maturity by either party upon the occurrence of certain events.  At settlement, the Canopy Debt Securities can be settled at the option of the issuer, in cash, equity shares of the issuer, or a combination thereof.  The fair value is estimated using a binomial lattice option-pricing model (Level
2 fair value measurement), which includes an estimate of the credit spread based on the implied spread as of the issuance date of the notes.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the inputs used to estimate the fair value of the Canopy Debt Securities are as follows:

Debt securities, Available-for-sale (“AFS”)

:  The fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using market-based inputs (Level 3 fair value measurement).

Short-term borrowings:

  The revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note which includes a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating (as defined in our senior credit facility).  Its fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level 2 fair value measurement).  The remaining instruments, including our commercial paper, are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.

Long-term debt:

  The term loans under our 2018 Credit Agreement and our Term Credit Agreement (both as defined in Note 

12

) are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon our debt rating.  The Senior Floating Rate Notes (as defined in Note 

12

) are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin.  The fair value of the term loans and the Senior Floating Rate Notes are estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions (Level
2 fair value measurement).  The fair value of the remaining long-term debt, which is primarily fixed interest rate, is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level
2 fair value measurement).

The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, approximate fair value as of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was 

$12,825.0 million

, compared with an estimated fair value of 

$12,768.5 million

.  As of 

February
28, 2018

, the carrying amount of long-term debt, including the current portion, was 

$9,439.9 million

Trademarks:

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, in connection with certain continuing negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio, including slower growth rates and increased competition, we implemented a change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio.  This change in strategy, when combined with the continuing negative trends, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value.  The change in strategy for our Ballast Point craft beer portfolio focuses on improving profitability by rationalizing the number of product offerings while targeting distribution growth in select strategic markets.  This change in strategy resulted in updated long-term financial forecasts with lower revenues and cash flows for the related portfolio.  Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset.  As a result of this assessment, the Ballast Point craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of 

$136.0 million

 was written down to its estimated fair value of 

$28.0 million

, resulting in an impairment of 

$108.0 million

.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we identified certain negative trends within our Beer segment’s Ballast Point craft beer portfolio which, when combined with the then-recent negative craft beer industry trends, including slower growth rates and increased competition, indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the craft beer trademarks might be below its carrying value.  These negative trends were the result of (i)

a disruption in our distribution network transition plan, (ii)

an unexpected decrease in sales from product innovations and (iii)

a significant shift in market conditions for our craft beer portfolio, all of which resulted in a decline in net sales and depletion trends, which represent distributor shipments of our branded products to retail customers, for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017, following consecutive quarters of significant net sales and depletion volume growth for our craft beer portfolio.  Additionally, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were below our forecasted net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Accordingly, we performed a quantitative assessment for impairment of the craft beer trademark asset.  As a result of this assessment, the craft beer trademark asset with a carrying value of 

$222.8 million

 was written down to its estimated fair value of 

$136.0 million

, resulting in an impairment of 

$86.8 million

.

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with our continued focus on the consumer-led trend towards premiumization of our branded wine and spirits portfolio, a decision was made to discontinue certain small-scale, lower-margin U.S. brands within our Wine and Spirits’ portfolio.  As a result, trademark assets with a carrying value of 

$37.6 million

 were written down to their estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment of 

$37.6 million

.

In addition, in connection with the Canadian Divestiture in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, trademark assets with a carrying value of 

$8.4 million

 were written down to their estimated fair value, resulting in an impairment of 

$8.4 million

.  These trademarks were associated with certain U.S. brands within our Wine and 

76

Table of Contents

Spirits’ portfolio sold exclusively through the Canadian wine business, for which we expected future sales of these brands to be minimal subsequent to the Canadian Divestiture.

When performing a quantitative assessment for impairment of a trademark asset, we measure the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of the trademark asset exceeds its estimated fair value.  The estimated fair value is determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of the trademark asset.  The cash flow projections we use to estimate the fair value of our trademark assets involve several assumptions, including (i)

projected revenue growth rates, (ii)

estimated royalty rates, (iii)

after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the trademarks and (iv)

discount rates used to derive the estimated fair value of the trademark assets.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS:

Our equity method investments are as follows:

In November 2017, we acquired 

18.9 million

 common shares, which represented a 

9.9%

 ownership interest in Ontario, Canada-based Canopy Growth Corporation (the “November 2017 Canopy Investment”), a public company and leading provider of medicinal and recreational cannabis products (“Canopy”), plus warrants which give us the option to purchase an additional 

18.9 million

 common shares of Canopy (the “November 2017 Canopy Warrants”) for 

C$245.0 million

, or 

$191.3 million

.  The November 2017 Canopy Warrants were issued with an exercise price of 

C$12.98

 per warrant share and are exercisable as of February 28, 2019.  These warrants expire in May 2020

.

The November 2017 Canopy Investment was accounted for at fair value from the date of investment through October
31, 2018.  From November 1, 2018, the November 2017 Canopy Investment has been accounted for under the equity method (see “Canopy Equity Method Investment” below).  The November 2017 Canopy Warrants have been accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.

On November
1, 2018, we increased our ownership interest in Canopy by acquiring an additional 

104.5 million

 common shares (the “November 2018 Canopy Investment”) (see Canopy Equity Method Investment below), plus warrants which give us the option to purchase an additional 

139.7 million

 common shares of Canopy (the “November 2018 Canopy Warrants”, and together with the November 2018 Canopy Investment, the “November 2018 Canopy Transaction”) for 

C$5,078.7 million

, or 

$3,869.9 million

.  The allocation of the consideration paid as of the date of closing was determined using a relative fair value approach based upon a market value of 

C$5,060.9 million

 for the acquired common shares and a fair value of 

C$2,131.3 million

 for the acquired warrants using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  The inputs used to estimate the fair value of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants as of November
1, 2018, are as follows:

Table of Contents

Accordingly, 

C$3,573.7 million

, or 

$2,723.1 million

, was allocated to the November 2018 Canopy Investment, and 

C$1,505.0 million

, or 

$1,146.8 million

, was allocated to the November 2018 Canopy Warrants.  In addition, we incurred 

$24.5 million

 of direct acquisition costs which were allocated to the acquired securities utilizing this relative fair value approach.  This resulted in 

$17.2 million

 of direct acquisition costs being allocated to the November 2018 Canopy Investment and included in the value of the Canopy Equity Method Investment under the cost-accumulation model, and 

$7.3 million

 being allocated to the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses.

The November 2018 Canopy Warrants consist of 

88.5 million

 warrants (the “Tranche A Warrants”) and 

51.2 million

 warrants (the “Tranche B Warrants”).  The Tranche A Warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of 

C$50.40

 per warrant share.  The Tranche B Warrants are exercisable upon the exercise, in full, of the Tranche A Warrants and at an exercise price based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy’s common shares on the TSX for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date.  The November 2018 Canopy Warrants expire in November 2021 and are accounted for at fair value from the date of investment.

On November
1, 2018, our ownership interest in Canopy increased to 

36.6%

 and, as this allows us to exercise significant influence over Canopy, we account for the November 2017 Canopy Investment and the November 2018 Canopy Investment, each of which represents an investment in common shares of Canopy, collectively, under the equity method (the “Canopy Equity Method Investment”).  As of November
1, 2018, the Canopy Equity Method Investment balance consisted of the amount allocated to the November 2018 Canopy Investment of 

$2,740.3 million

, plus the fair value of the November 2017 Canopy Investment at that date of 

$694.9 million

.  We recognize equity in earnings (losses) for this investment on a two-month lag.  Accordingly, we recognized 

$2.6 million

 of equity in losses from Canopy’s results of operations for the period November
1, 2018, through December
31, 2018, and related activities, in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 

February
28, 2019

.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the carrying amount of the Canopy Equity Method Investment is greater than our equity in the book value of net assets of Canopy by 

$1.4 billion

.  This difference primarily represents our basis in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill associated with the November 2018 investment.  Equity in earnings (losses) from the Canopy Equity Method Investment and related activities include, among other items, the amortization of the fair value adjustments associated with the definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, the flow through of inventory step up and unrealized gains associated with changes in our Canopy ownership percentage resulting from periodic equity issuances made by Canopy.

Canopy has various convertible equity securities outstanding, including equity awards granted to its employees and options and warrants issued to various third parties, including our November 2017 Canopy Warrants and November 2018 Canopy Warrants.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the conversion of Canopy equity securities held by its employees and/or held by other third parties would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses.  Additionally, under an amended and restated investor rights agreement, we have the option to purchase additional common shares of Canopy at the then-current price of the underlying equity security to allow us to maintain our relative ownership interest.  The exercise of our November 2017 Canopy Warrants as of 

February
28, 2019

, also would not have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses.  However, as of 

February
28, 2019

, the exercise of all of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the November 2018 Canopy Warrants held by us would result in an increase in our ownership interest in Canopy to greater than 50% and the consolidation of Canopy’s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations with the recognition of an associated noncontrolling ownership interest, as appropriate.  This could have a significant effect on our share of Canopy’s reported earnings or losses.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the exercise of all Canopy warrants held by us would have required a cash outflow of approximately 

$5.9 billion

 based on the terms of the November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the November 2018 Canopy Warrants.  Additionally, as of 

February
28, 2019

, the fair value of our equity method investment in Canopy was 

$5,842.9 million

 based on the closing price of the underlying equity security as of that date.

The following table presents summarized financial information for Canopy presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  The amounts shown represent 100% of Canopy’s financial position as of December
31, 2018, and results of operations from the date of our investment on November
1, 2018, through December
31, 2018. We recognize our equity in earnings (losses) for Canopy on a two-month lag.  Accordingly, we recognized our share of

Table of Contents

Canopy’s losses from November and December 2018, which was included in Canopy’s third quarter fiscal 2019 results, in our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results.

Subsequent event –

In April 2019, we agreed to modify the terms of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants and certain other rights.  Modification of the November 2018 Canopy Warrants is subject to, among other things, approval by Canopy’s shareholders.  These changes are the result of Canopy’s intention to acquire Acreage Holdings, Inc. (“Acreage”) upon U.S. Federal cannabis legalization, subject to certain conditions.  As a result of the proposed modifications, and following all necessary Canopy shareholder approvals, we will continue to have the option to purchase an additional 

139.7 million

 common shares of Canopy upon exercise of the warrants originally received in November 2018; however, this option will consist of three tranches of warrants, including 

88.5 million

 warrants (the “New Tranche A Warrants”), 

38.4 million

 warrants (the “New Tranche B Warrants”) and 

12.8 million

 warrants (the “New Tranche C Warrants”, and collectively with the New Tranche A Warrants and the New Tranche B Warrants, the “New November 2018 Canopy Warrants”).  The New Tranche A Warrants will continue to have an exercise price of 

C$50.40

 per warrant share and remain currently exercisable, but would expire November
1, 2023.  The New Tranche B Warrants would have an exercise price of 

C$76.68

 per warrant share and the New Tranche C Warrants would have an exercise price based on the volume-weighted average of the closing market price of Canopy’s common shares on the TSX for the five trading days immediately preceding the exercise date.  The New Tranche B Warrants and the New Tranche C Warrants would have an expiration date of November
1, 2026.  If Canopy exercises its proposed right to acquire the shares of Acreage and we were to exercise all of our outstanding November 2017 Canopy Warrants and the New November 2018 Canopy Warrants, our ownership interest in Canopy would no longer be expected to be greater than 50
percent.

In addition, the Company and certain of our U.S. subsidiaries executed an amended and restated guarantee agreement which, among other things, released certain of our U.S. subsidiaries as guarantors of borrowings under the 2017 Credit Agreement.  Furthermore, the European Borrowers executed an amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement which, among other things, removed CIHH as a party to the amended and restated cross-guarantee agreement.

In November 2017, we repaid the outstanding obligations under the European Term
A loan facility under the 2017 Credit Agreement primarily with proceeds from the November
2017 senior notes.

In August 2018, the Company, CIH, CB International, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the “August 2018 Restatement Agreement”) that amended and restated the 2017 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the August 2018 Restatement Agreement, the “August 2018 Credit Agreement”).

[/TABLE]

In September 2018, the Company, CB International, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries as guarantors, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a Restatement Agreement (the “2018 Restatement Agreement”) that amended and restated the August 2018 Credit Agreement (as amended and restated by the 2018 Restatement Agreement, the “2018 Credit Agreement”).  The primary change effected by the 2018 Restatement Agreement was the increase of the revolving credit facility from 

$1.5 billion

 to 

$2.0 billion

 and extension of its maturity to September
14, 2023.  The 2018 Restatement Agreement also modified certain financial covenants in connection with the November
2018 Canopy Transaction and added various representations and warranties, covenants and an event of default related to the November
2018 Canopy Transaction.

Term Credit Agreement:

In September 2018, the Company, the Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders entered into a term loan credit agreement (the “Term Credit Agreement”).  The Term Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of 

$1.5 billion

, consisting of a 

$500.0 million

three-year term loan facility (the “Three-Year Term Facility”) and a 

$1.0 billion

five-year term loan facility (the “Five-Year Term Facility”).

The Three-Year Term Facility is not subject to amortization payments, with the balance due and payable at maturity.  The Five-Year Term Facility will be repaid in quarterly payments of principal equal to 1.25% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Five-Year Term Facility, with the balance due and payable at maturity.

Table of Contents

General:

The obligations under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  We and our subsidiaries are subject to covenants that are contained in the 2018 Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness) by subsidiaries that are not guarantors, additional liens, mergers and consolidations, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds.  The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net leverage ratio.

Our senior credit facility permits us to elect, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions, to increase the revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans (the “Incremental Facilities”).  The Incremental Facilities may be an unlimited amount so long as our leverage ratio, as defined and computed pursuant to our senior credit facility, is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 subject to certain limitations for the period defined pursuant to our senior credit facility.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, aggregate credit facilities under the 2018 Credit Agreement and the Term Credit Agreement consist of the following:

[TABLE]

(1)

Contractual interest rate varies based on our debt rating (as defined in the respective agreement) and is a function of LIBOR plus a margin, or the base rate plus a margin, or, in certain circumstances where LIBOR cannot be adequately ascertained or available, an alternative benchmark rate plus a margin.

Commercial paper program

 –

In October
2017, we implemented a commercial paper program which provided for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of 

$1.0 billion

 of commercial paper.  In October

83

Table of Contents

authorized a 

$1.0 billion

 increase to our commercial paper program, thereby providing for the issuance of up to an aggregate principal amount of 

$2.0 billion

 of commercial paper.  Our commercial paper program is backed by unused commitments under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.  Accordingly, outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program reduce the amount available under our revolving credit facility under our 2018 Credit Agreement.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, we had 

$732.5 million

 of outstanding borrowings, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program with a weighted average annual interest rate of 

3.0%

[/TABLE]

For the year ended February
28, 2018, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 

$97.0 million

.  This amount consisted of a make-whole payment of 

$73.6 million

 in connection with the early redemption of our April 2012 senior notes and the write-off of debt issuance costs of 

$23.4 million

 primarily in connection with the prior-to-maturity repayments of term loan facilities under our applicable senior credit facility in May and November 2017.

Indentures

 –

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:

(i)

a limitation on liens on certain assets, (ii)

a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions and (iii)

restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

Subsidiary credit facilities –

General:

We have additional credit arrangements totaling 

$45.1 million

 and 

$503.5 million

 as of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, respectively.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, amounts outstanding under these arrangements were 

$28.9 million

 and 

$277.0 million

, respectively, the majority of which is classified as long-term as of the respective date.  These arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations (see “Other long-term debt” for additional information).  Interest rates and other terms of these borrowings vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions.

Other long-term debt:

During the year ended February 28, 2019, we recorded a conversion of 

$248.2 million

 from long-term debt to noncontrolling equity interests associated with the noncash settlement of a prior contractual agreement with our glass production plant joint venture partner, Owens-Illinois.  During the year ended February 28, 2017, we had recorded a noncash conversion of 

$132.0 million

 from noncontrolling equity interests to long-term debt associated with the same contractual agreement.  As of 

February
28, 2018

, outstanding borrowings under this contractual agreement were 

$230.5 million

 and were included in our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with our consolidation of this variable interest entity.

INCOME TAXES:

Income before income taxes was generated as follows:

The income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following:

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJ Act”) was signed into law.  The TCJ Act significantly changes U.S. corporate income taxes by, among other items, lowering the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax and imposing a 

86

Table of Contents

mandatory one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the income tax accounting implications of the TCJ Act.  This guidance provides a measurement period, which extends no longer than one year from the enactment date of the TCJ Act, during which a company may complete its accounting for the income tax implications of the TCJ Act.  In accordance with this guidance, we recognized a provisional net income tax benefit of 

$351.2 million

 for the year ended February
28, 2018.  This amount is comprised primarily of (i)

a benefit of 

$311.2 million

 from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower federal statutory rate and (ii)

a benefit of 

$220.0 million

 from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously provided for unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries which were not considered to be indefinitely reinvested; partially offset by the recording of the mandatory one-time transition tax of 

$180.0 million

 on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis of the income tax implications of the TCJ Act.  We recognized an additional income tax benefit of 

$37.6 million

 resulting from a decrease in the mandatory one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of our foreign businesses.

The TCJ Act also creates a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries (“GILTI”), must be included in U.S. gross income.  The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current period expense when incurred.  We have elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current period tax expense when incurred.

Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we had historically provided deferred income taxes for the repatriation to the U.S. of earnings from our foreign subsidiaries.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, in connection with the agreement to divest the Canadian wine business and the ongoing Beer capacity expansion activities in Mexico, including the agreement to acquire the Obregon Brewery, we changed our assertion regarding our ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.  Approximately 

$420 million

 of our earnings for the year ended February
28, 2017, and all future earnings for these foreign subsidiaries were expected to be indefinitely reinvested.  Therefore, no deferred income taxes had been provided on these applicable unremitted earnings.  Although we expect to continue to reinvest these foreign earnings, as the TCJ Act reduces the tax impact of repatriation, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we have provided deferred income taxes, consisting primarily of foreign withholding and state taxes, on all applicable unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

A reconciliation of the total tax provision (benefit) to the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes is as follows:

[TABLE]

Includes differences resulting from adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.

Represents the recognition of the income tax effect of stock-based compensation awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled as a result of our March 1, 2017, adoption of FASB amended share-based compensation guidance (see Note

).

[/TABLE]

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income.

Significant components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In making this assessment, we consider the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income.  Based upon this assessment, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation allowances.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, operating loss carryforwards, which are primarily state and foreign, totaling 

$833.3 million

 are being carried forward in a number of jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income.  Of these operating loss carryforwards, 

$745.5 million

 will expire in fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2039 and 

$87.8 million

 of operating losses in certain jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely.  Additionally, as of 

February
28, 2019

, federal capital losses totaling 

$222.3 million

 are being carried forward and will expire in fiscal 2022.

We have recognized valuation allowances for operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that these items will not be realized.  The decrease in our valuation allowances as of 

February
28, 2019

, primarily relates to the reversal of valuation allowances in connection with the sale of our Accolade Wine Investment in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.

Table of Contents

The liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, and a reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is as follows:

As of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, we had 

$239.0 million

 and 

$93.7 million

, respectively, of non-current unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, recognized on our balance sheets.  These liabilities are recorded as non-current as payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date.

As of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, we had 

$224.3 million

 and 

$89.3 million

, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate.

We file U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state, local and foreign income tax returns.  Major tax jurisdictions where we are subject to examination by tax authorities include Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland and the U.S.  Various U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax examinations are currently in progress.  It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities will increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, we estimate that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities could change by a range of 

$1 million

 to 

$13 million

.  With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to February
29, 2012.

We provide for additional tax expense based on probable outcomes of ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions.  While it is often difficult to predict the outcome or the timing of resolution of any tax matter, we believe the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Operating leases –

The minimum lease payments for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.  Step rent provisions, escalation clauses, capital improvement funding and other lease concessions, when present in our leases, are taken into account in computing the minimum lease payments.

Future payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter:

Rental expense was 

$63.5 million

, 

$59.1 million

 for the years ended 

February

, 

February

, and 

February

, respectively.

Purchase commitments and contingencies –

We have entered into various long-term contracts in the normal course of business for the purchase of (i)

certain inventory components, (ii)

property, plant and equipment and related contractor and manufacturing services, (iii)

processing and warehousing services, (iv)

transportation services and (v)

certain energy requirements.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, the estimated aggregate minimum purchase obligations under these contracts are as follows:

[TABLE]

(1)

Certain grape purchasing arrangements include the purchase of grape production yielded from specified blocks of a vineyard.  The actual tonnage and price of grapes that we purchase will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions and the agricultural practices and location of the vineyard.  Amounts included herein for the estimated aggregate minimum grape purchase obligations consist of estimates for the purchase of the grapes and the implicit leases of the land.  Upon adoption of the new lease guidance on March
1, 2019, certain grape purchasing arrangements classified as leases will result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet.  However, certain other grape purchasing arrangements classified as leases will not result in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet due to their variable nature.

, respectively.

Indemnification liabilities –

In connection with prior divestitures, we have indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise subsequent to the divestiture.  As of February 28, 2019, and February 28, 2018, these liabilities consist primarily of indemnifications related to certain income tax matters.  During the year ended February 28, 2019, in connection with the sale of the Accolade Wine Investment, we were released from certain guarantees and we recognized a gain of 

$3.7 million

 as part of the net gain on the sale of this business.  This net gain is included in income from unconsolidated investments.  As of 

February
28, 2019

, and 

February
28, 2018

, the carrying amount of our indemnification liabilities was 

$9.2 million

 and 

$12.8 million

, respectively, and is included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities.  We do not expect to be required to make material payments under the indemnifications and we believe that the likelihood is remote that the indemnifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.

Legal matters –

In the course of our business, we are subject to litigation from time to time.  Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, such liability will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Other –

In connection with the write-down of certain bulk wine inventory as a result of smoke damage sustained during the Fall 2017 California wildfires, we have recognized total losses of 

$20.6 million

, with 

$1.5 million

 recognized for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 

$19.1 million

 recognized for the fourth quarter of 2018.  While we are pursuing reimbursement from our insurance carriers, there can be no assurance there will be any potential recoveries.

.

STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:

Common stock –

We have 

two

 classes of common stock with a material number of shares outstanding:

Class
A Common Stock and Class
B Convertible Common Stock.  Class
B Convertible Common Stock shares are 

convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis

 at any time at the option of the holder.  Holders of Class
B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to 

ten votes per share

.  Holders of Class
A Common Stock are entitled to 

one vote per share

 and a cash dividend premium.  If we pay a cash dividend on Class
B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class
A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 

ten

 percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class
B Convertible Common Stock.  In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class
A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class
B Convertible Common Stock.  However, our senior credit facility limits the cash dividends that we can pay on our common stock to a fixed amount per quarter but the fixed amount may be exceeded subject to various conditions set forth in the senior credit facility.

In addition, we have a class of common stock with an immaterial number of shares outstanding:

Class
1 Common Stock.  Shares of Class
1 Common Stock 

generally have no voting rights

.  Class
1 Common Stock shares are 

convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis

 at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class
A Common Stock acquired upon conversion.  Because shares of Class
1 Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class
A Common Stock, for each share of Class
1 Common Stock issued, we must reserve one share of Class
A Common Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class
1 Common Stock.  Holders of Class
1 Common Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors.  If we pay a cash dividend on Class
1 Common Stock, each share of Class
A Common Stock will receive an amount at least 

ten

 percent greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class
1 Common Stock.  In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class
A Common Stock without paying a dividend on Class
1 Common Stock.  The cash dividends declared and paid on Class
B Convertible Common Stock and Class
1 Common Stock must always be the same.

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION:

Effective March
1, 2017, we adopted the FASB amended guidance for, among other items, the accounting for income taxes related to share-based compensation and the related classification in the statement of cash flows.  This guidance requires the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies (resulting from an increase or decrease in the fair value of an award from grant date to the vesting or settlement date) in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur.  Through February
28, 2017, these amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital at the time of vesting or settlement.  Additionally, effective March
1, 2017, excess tax benefits are classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity where they were previously presented.  We adopted this guidance on a prospective basis and, accordingly, prior periods have not been adjusted.  The adoption of this amended guidance also impacted our calculation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method, as excess tax benefits and deficiencies resulting from share-based compensation are no longer included in the assumed proceeds calculation.

We have 

two

 stock-based employee compensation plans (as further discussed below).  Total compensation cost recognized for our stock-based awards and income tax benefits related thereto are as follows:

Long-term stock incentive plan –

Under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other stock-based awards may be granted to our employees, officers and directors.  The aggregate number of shares of our Class
A Common Stock and Class
1 Common Stock available for awards under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is 

108,000,000

 shares.

The exercise price, vesting period and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the “Committee”).  The exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the fair market value of our Class
A Common Stock on the date of grant.  Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a 

four

-year period from the date of grant and expire as established by the Committee, but not later than 

ten

 years after the grant date.

Grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting periods, terms, conditions and other requirements as the Committee may establish.  Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on service and generally vest over 

one

 to 

four

 years from the date of grant.  Performance share unit awards are based on service and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and vest over a required employee service period, generally from 

one

 to 

three

 years from the date of grant, which closely matches the performance period.  The performance conditions include the achievement of specified financial or operational performance metrics, or market conditions which require the achievement of specified levels of shareholder return relative to other companies as defined in the applicable performance share unit agreement.  The 

93

Table of Contents

actual number of shares to be awarded upon vesting of a performance share unit award will range between 

0%

 and 

200%

 of the target award, based upon the measure of performance as certified by the Committee.

A summary of stock option activity under our Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:

As of 

February
28, 2019

, the aggregate intrinsic value of our options outstanding and exercisable was 

$527.2 million

 and 

$517.9 million

, respectively.  In addition, the weighted average remaining contractual life for our options outstanding and exercisable was 

4.5 years

 and 

3.5 years

, respectively.

The fair value of stock options vested, and the intrinsic value of and tax benefit realized from the exercise of stock options, are as follows:

Employee stock purchase plan –

We have a stock purchase plan (the “Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) under which 

9,000,000

 shares of Class
A Common Stock may be issued.  Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of our Class
A Common Stock through payroll deductions.  The purchase price is the lower of 

85%

 of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period.  For the years ended 

February
28, 2019

, 

February
28, 2018

, and 

February
28, 2017

, employees purchased 

76,844

 shares, 

75,023

 shares and 

77,671

 shares, respectively, under this plan.

Other –

As of 

February

2.4 years

.  With respect to the issuance of shares under any of our stock-based compensation plans, we have the option to issue authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

10% or more of our net sales

, and the associated amounts receivable from this customer as a percentage of our accounts receivable, are as follows:

Net sales for the above customer are primarily reported within the Wine and Spirits segment.  Our arrangements with certain of our customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice.  The majority of our accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom we have a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial position, and management is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of our customers and geographic sales area.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

Our internal management financial reporting consists of 

two

 business divisions:

(i)

Beer and (ii)

Wine and Spirits, and we report our operating results in 

three

 segments:

(i)

Beer, (ii)

Wine and Spirits, and (iii)

Corporate Operations and Other.  

In the Beer segment, our portfolio consists of high-end imported and craft beer brands.  We have an exclusive perpetual brand license to import, market and sell in the U.S. our Mexican beer portfolio.  In the Wine and Spirits segment, we sell a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine brands complemented by certain higher-end spirits brands.  Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance,

corporate growth and strategy, 

human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and information technology, as well as our investments in Canopy Growth Corporation and those made through our corporate venture capital function.  All costs included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments.  All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments.

The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

In addition, management excludes items that affect comparability (“Comparable Adjustments”) from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Comparable Adjustments are not reflective of core operations of the segments.  Segment operating performance and segment management compensation are evaluated based upon core segment operating income (loss).  As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these Comparable Adjustments.

We evaluate segment operating performance based on operating income (loss) of the respective business units.  Comparable Adjustments that impacted comparability in our segment operating income (loss) for each period are as follows:

, subject to certain adjustments (the “Wine and Spirits Transaction”). The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, and is expected to close around the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2020.
