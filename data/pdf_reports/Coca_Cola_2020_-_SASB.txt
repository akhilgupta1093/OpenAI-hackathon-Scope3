Reporting 
Frameworks 
& SDGs

In this document, we index the contents 
of The Coca-Cola Company’s 2020 Business 
& Environmental, Social and Governance 
Report to several important reporting 
frameworks and standards.

We prepared this report in accordance with  
the GRI Standards: Core option. This is the tenth 
consecutive year that these reporting principles 
have informed our reporting process. 

This report also meets the requirements of 
the United Nations Global Compact Advanced 
Communication on Progress and aligns with 
the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting 
Framework, which addresses reporting on 
human rights. References are included in the 
2020 GRI Content Index.

This is our first report to include an index for  
the standards set by the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB). Our Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) index highlights 
our key public disclosures on climate change,  
in alignment with the TCFD recommendations.  
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(UN SDG) index provides information on where our 
programs most directly contribute to the UN SDG 
goals and targets.

We review our reporting regularly and aim to be as 
responsive as possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.

2020 GRI Content Index

The GRI Standards provide a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, 
economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. 
This is the tenth consecutive year that GRI’s principles have informed our reporting process.

In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other disclosures, the scope is 
identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance disclosures required by the GRI, we report on 
additional disclosures important to our broad range of stakeholders.

Additional Reporting Frameworks 
This index also highlights where our reporting meets the requirements of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) 
Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).

of the natural system, and since 2020, the Coca-Cola internal requirements for  
Source Water Vulnerability Assessments and Water Management Plans (WMP) are 
aligned with the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) global industry standard 
principles. Our operations will be transitioning to this approach within the  
2030 Water Strategy. For new land purchases and in Mergers & Acquisitions, we 
require an Environmental and Safety Due Diligence including the “evaluation of 
wetlands and endangered species.”

The 2020 Business & ESG Report details our activities on water stewardship and 
sustainable agriculture which focus on habitat and ecosystem restoration. For 
example, in our 2020 replenishment results, we include 144 productive replenish 
projects that deliver ecosystem protection and restoration over a total of 720,000 
hectares. In addition, 56% of our priority ingredients volume are sustainably sourced, 
which is based on independently assured farm sustainability standards with 
leading biodiversity and ecosystem protection requirements (e.g. Bonsucro, SAI-FSA, 
Rainforest Alliance).

*Not required for GRI Core option.

As a global system that, in 2020, produced 1.9 billion servings a day, we consider 
the most important part of this disclosure to be product safety for the end consumer. 
Given that we report for the approximately 225 bottling partners across the Coca-Cola 
system, we do not generate all-inclusive, consolidated information for this metric.

However, we applied the following methodology to assess this metric to the best of 
our ability: we reviewed our incident management database and identified a total of 
10 matters that had a food safety aspect. We identified five incidents that had some 
contact with regulatory authorities. The total number of incidents that met both 
criteria is four.

The Coca-Cola Company and The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were first launched in 2015 and are a core part of the agenda developed by the 193 
member states of the United Nations to work toward the future we want, one where all people thrive within a healthy environment. 
The 17 goals—geared toward a 2030 timeframe—and their related 169 targets have become an important framework for companies 
to rally around as they address an array of complex, interrelated global issues.

We recognize that we cannot achieve any one of the SDGs on our own. Yet, as a global company with a wide supply chain and 
consumer reach, we have a significant role to play in meeting many of these ambitious aims. We have taken a closer look at where we 
can make direct contributions to the SDGs, whether through collaboration with our partners and industry peers, supplier engagement, 
or in other places where we have leverage to amplify our positive impacts. 

The following table outlines the SDG goals and specific targets to which we most directly contribute, with links to more information.
