We have environmental and social requirements for 
purchasing all our major ingredients. For some, we source 
in accordance with internationally recognized standards 
such as RSPO and Fair Trade. However, as a grain-based

total volume of ingredients purchased. We continue to 
work with our suppliers to responsible source and 
sustainably grow our ingredients.
