Cover note: In many parts of the world, ladybugs are 
considered to be a symbol of luck and prosperity and an omen 
of a good harvest. There are around 500 native species of 
ladybugs in North America. They play an important role in 
biodiversity as a predator of aphids and scale insects. This is also 
beneficial for agriculture where they serve as crop protectors, 
providing a biological form of pest-control.

CEO Statement

Dear Stakeholders,

When ADM last reported on its ESG efforts, we 
were still in the early stages of an unprecedented 
global pandemic. Economies were closing. Store 
shelves were emptying. No one knew how long 
it might last or when vaccines might arrive, and 
there was genuine concern about global food 
supply chains grinding to a halt.

At ADM, we knew what we had to do. Our first priority was 
protecting our workplace, which we did by enacting strict protocols 
to protect our frontline workers, and enabling thousands of office 
and lab colleagues to work remotely. Second, we kept our company 
running, meeting customer needs and supporting the global food 
chain in times of unprecedented demand volatility. Third, we did 
not allow anything to distract us from continuing to deliver on our 
strategic goals, and most importantly, on our purpose: unlocking 
the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.

Underlying that purpose – and our entire business – is our 
understanding of the fundamental importance of sustainable 
and responsible practices, and our commitment to supporting 
our planet and its natural resources. We continue to support 
the United Nations Global Compact and its 10 principles. We’ve 
committed to meet our fundamental responsibilities in the areas 
of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As the 
bridge between growers and the products on store shelves, ADM is 
in a unique position to influence responsible practices throughout 
the entire agricultural value chain.

It starts on the farm, where we work closely with our global 
network of suppliers to advance sustainable practices to improve 
yields, conserve water, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 
2020, we surpassed 13 million acres that we’ve supported through 
sustainable farming programs over recent years. We’re also a 
leader in enhancing the transparency and traceability in global 
supply chains. In March of 2021, six years after we launched our 
first comprehensive no-deforestation policy, we unveiled a new 
policy encompassing ambitious new goals, including achieving 
full traceability of our direct and indirect soybean sourcing in 
Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina by the end of 2022, and aiming for 
deforestation-free supply chains around the globe by 2030.

Our efforts continue after the harvest. We’re making strides 
in meeting our ambitious Strive 35 plan to reduce the 
environmental impact of our processing operations by 
reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, water, energy and waste 
by 2035. We’re improving the efficiency of our facilities and 
vehicles, finding alternative uses for waste, reusing and recycling 
water, and sequestering carbon at our onsite capture and storage 
facility. We’re rolling out new ideas and new technologies, from 
the use of ADM trucks and biodiesel to pilot innovative B100 
technology, to our Manufacturing Innovation initiatives, which are 
keeping our facilities running safely and efficiently.

And finally, we’re providing customers and consumers with an 
ever-expanding array of responsibly-produced, plant-based 
products. Consumers today expect their food and drink to come 
from sustainable ingredients, produced by companies that share 
their values. We’re continually finding new ways to meet those 
needs, like our PlantPlus Foods plant-based protein joint venture, 
our partnership with Spiber Inc. to produce corn-based polymers 

for use in a variety of consumer products, our agreement with 
InnovaFeed that will result in the construction of the largest 
insect protein facility, and our support of innovative nutrition and 
microbiome startups like Air Protein and Future Meat Technologies.

Of course, our purpose and our commitment to improving lives 
around the globe encompasses even more. This report details how 
our charitable efforts are creating positive impacts for producers, 
partners and more by combatting hunger, increasing access to 
clean water, and helping overcome challenges from COVID-19. We 
continue to dramatically expand our leadership role in diversity, 
equity and inclusion, with ADM leaders taking a visible and vocal 
role in addressing these important issues, both externally and 
within our company. And of course, the health and safety of our 
39,000 colleagues around the globe remains our highest priority; 
we are proud of our efforts to protect our facilities, offices and labs 
from COVID-19, and we continue to focus on improving workplace 
safety across the enterprise.

I’m proud that ADM has once again been recognized for our 
proactive citizenship efforts, from our 13th consecutive year as one 
of Fortune magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies”, to our 
second inclusion in S&P Global’s Sustainability Yearbook, and being 
named once again by Ethisphere as one of the world’s most ethical 
companies. But more than that, I’m proud of our team. In a year of 
tremendous challenge, they never stopped innovating, creating and 
solving in order to deliver on our commitments and make the world a 
better place.

Sustainability Commitments and Policies

ADM has set forth several key social and environmental 
commitments and policies that collectively outline our 
expectations for our colleagues, business partners and 
contractors, and our organization as a whole, with respect 
to our sourcing operations. They establish clear standards 
that govern our approach to raw material sourcing, 
environmental stewardship and employee conduct, 
among other areas, and they state our positions on issues 
of widespread public interest. These standards were 
developed with input from our operations, law, compliance, 
environmental, and health and safety teams, and were 
approved by Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano.

Sustainability Strategy, 
Governance and Risk 
Management

At ADM, the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee 
(“Sustainability Committee”) of the Board has direct oversight 
responsibility for the company’s objectives, goals, strategies and 
activities relating to sustainability and corporate responsibility 
matters. The Sustainability Committee also oversees the company’s 
compliance with sustainability and corporate responsibility 
laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry 
benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in ensuring that the 
company operates as a sustainable organization and responsible 
corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect 
ADM’s reputation.

Regional sustainability teams — along with the corporate 
sustainability team — support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive 
sustainability efforts in our facilities and supply chains around the 
world. Our sustainability efforts are also supported by Centers of 
Excellence (CoE) that drive efficiency programs in their areas of focus 
such as the Utilities CoE, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion CoE, and 
Environmental, Health and Safety CoE.

Sustainability Governance:  
Strategy and Risk Overview

Board of Directors
 • Receives sustainability updates at each quarterly Board meeting
 • Reviews risk matrices, including risks related to climate 

change and other sustainability matters, prepared by ERM 
team at each quarterly Board meeting

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility  
Committee of the Board

 • Has direct oversight responsibility of objectives, goals, 
strategies, risks, and activities related to sustainability

Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)

 • Leads ADM’s sustainability efforts
 • Reports metrics quarterly to ADM Board of Directors
 • Meets quarterly with ADM Board of Directors’ Sustainability 

and Corporate Social Responsibility Committee 

 • Reports regularly to ADM leadership

Regional and Corporate Sustainability Teams

 • Support business units to drive transformation and help 

create value across the supply chain 

 • Support sustainability initiatives and implementation  

on the ground

 • Engage and interact with stakeholders
 • Located in North America, South America and EMEAI

ADM uses a multi-disciplinary, 
companywide enterprise risk 
management (ERM) process to 
assess sustainability risks including 
climate change and deforestation. 
Each quarter, the ERM Sustainability 
subgroup reviews and reports 
sustainability risks and the related 
mitigation actions with the ERM 
team. The group uses a risk matrix 
which includes a quantitative 
review of impact, mitigation, and 
residual risk as well as qualitative 
information about risk categories, 
warning periods, mitigation strategies 
and effectiveness. The ERM term 
compiles risks from all subgroups for 
quarterly reporting to the Board.

Our sustainability governance includes the identification, monitoring and management of risks and opportunities to maximize the impact and effectiveness of our programs. In line with TCFD guidelines, we have 
identified our sustainability-related key risks and opportunities:

Risks

Transition 
Risks

Physical 
Risks

 • Emerging regulation and carbon pricing mechanisms could result in 

increased operational costs in the short to medium term. 

 • Any changes in policy or introduction of new policies could introduce 
additional tax requirements at our facilities. For example, in South 
America, introduction of the national legislation on biomass based power 
generation units, which requires additional certification and taxes, could 
limit our ability to operate our assets and increase our operating costs.

 • Market demand has a direct effect on production, as well as directing 

sustainable sourcing initiatives. Changes in consumer demands could result in 
additional cost of implementation that may not be overcome by product sales.

 • ADM uses coal-fired cogeneration technology to meet a sizeable portion 
of its energy demand. We are working to reduce the carbon footprint of 
our operations, but transitions can be time intensive and costly.

 • Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such 

as cyclones and floods could lead to increased direct costs from the 
disruption of supply chains and impair our ability to deliver products to 
customers in a timely manner.

 • Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such 

as cyclones and floods could lead to increased sourcing costs due to 
limited availability of agricultural commodities and impact ADM’s ability 
to produce goods, which would directly affect sales and revenue.

 • Increased calls for preserving and enhancing biodiversity by taking acres 
out of production—at a time when the world’s supply of raw materials 
is in great demand—may challenge ADM’s stewardship of natural 
resources. As the global population grows, and producers in many areas 
of the world must plant more to feed more people, a balance must be 
appropriately struck, or raw material shortages may result.

Opportunities

Resource 
Efficiency

 • Developing enhanced transportation and warehousing scheduling, 

routing and tracking technologies can reduce carbon footprint and costs 
while improving customer delivery satisfaction.

Products & 
Services

 • Development and expansion of low-emission goods and services could 

lead to increased revenues resulting from increased demand. As various 
renewable fuel standards are implemented around the world, ADM has 
an opportunity to capitalize through the production and sale of ethanol, 
biodiesel, and renewable green diesel.

 • As more businesses and consumers look to renewable products, 

development of new products or services from R&D and innovation 
could lead to increased revenues through access to new and 
emerging markets.

Materiality Assessment and 
Stakeholder Engagement

According to the Global Reporting Innitiative (GRI), 
materiality is a way to assess the topics that have a direct 
or indirect impact on an organization’s ability to create, 
preserve or erode economic, environmental and social 
value for itself, its stakeholders and society at large.

Materiality is a crucial step in defining our sustainability 
program. With so many topics that could be covered, 
conducting a materiality assessment allows us to focus 
our reporting on topics that reflect the economic, 
environmental and social impacts that are the most 
significant to our strategy and business operations, and to 
our stakeholders.

ADM engaged a reputable professional services firm to 
undertake an updated formal materiality assessment 
to guide our sustainability strategy in the coming years. 
Although this year’s Corporate Sustainability Report 
and priorities are based on the previous materiality 
assessment, we are presenting the refreshed matrix in 
order to inform all stakeholders of where we are going. 

The process applied this year was similar to that used for the 
2017 materiality assessment.  The assessment team applied 
its knowledge of the GRI methodology and our industry to 
select stakeholders for engagement based on the selection 
criteria of responsibility, influence, proximity, dependency, 
and representation. Working with ADM, the firm interviewed, 
surveyed, and researched publicly available information for a 
variety of internal and external stakeholders. 

The following stakeholder groups were included as part of 
the assessment: 

 • ADM leadership
 • Investors 
 • Customers

 • Employees 
 • Civil society/non-governmental 

organizations (NGOs)

At the outset of the assessment, informed by the current 
landscape and with a forward-looking lens, the firm 
and ADM revised previous topic names and definitions. 
Consequently, some topics were disaggregated or 
consolidated to better reflect the way ADM manages the 
issues such as separating “Biodiversity” from “Land Use” 
and renaming the latter to “Deforestation & Conversion.” 
Through the process, new topics were also identified, 
including but not limited to: “Transparency,” “Information 
& Cyber Security,” “Tax Strategy,” and “Alternative Products 
& Green Chemistry.”

The assessment results indicate several key topics 
that are consistent across all stakeholder groups as 
critical importance: “GHG Emissions,” “Deforestation & 
Conversion,” “Governance,” and “Water Management.” 
Although these are critical to manage, the other topics 
on the matrix are also important to ADM and our 
stakeholders. 

We recognize that these priorities can change rapidly, 
so we will continue to monitor and adjust our focus 
as informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement via 
customer feedback, NGO inquiries, and dialogue with 
stakeholders. Any interested party can reach out to us at 
sustainability@adm.com. All of these touchpoints help 
direct our sustainability programs.

Goals, Targets and KPIs

The United Nations Development Programme created the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action 
to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy 
peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs provide clear guidelines and 
targets for countries and governments, although industry still has a 
vital role to help achieve these goals. At ADM, we have undertaken a 
mapping exercise to determine which SDGs align with our business 
objectives and in turn, allow us to make the greatest contribution 
toward achievement. Specifically, we are focusing our efforts 
toward Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and 
Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land. 

Below are highlights of some of our activities that support our 
commitment to these SDGs, as well as some of our other company goals.

Strive 35 Environmental Goals

New Commitments
ADM is fully committed to ending deforestation, preserving biodiversity and conserving resources in our operations and supply chain. In 
March 2021, we released our new Policy to Protect Forests, Biodiversity and Communities and a target date to eliminate deforestation in our 
supply chains. Also, to ensure we are charting a path to achieve our Strive35 goals, we set 5-year targets to measure our progress against these 
longer-term goals.

Introduction

We know that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that our 
commitment to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world. 
ADM is committed to meeting its environmental obligations, while pursuing ways to 
continually improve our efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing 
environmental sustainability.

We have a large industrial footprint and believe it is important to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions related to our business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. We use 
internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce our GHG 
emissions globally to meet our commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In 2020, we engaged with a leading engineering professional services firm to conduct an in-depth 
carbon reduction feasibility study and help us shape our new set of goals to combat climate 
change. Our new environmental goals, collectively called “Strive 35” – an ambitious plan to, by 

2035, reduce absolute GHG emissions by 25 percent, reduce energy intensity by 15 percent, 
reduce water intensity by 10 percent, and achieve a 90 percent landfill diversion rate. We also 
committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community wellbeing in priority 
watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by 2025.

At ADM, we have a robust Environmental Management System (EMS) aligned with ISO to manage 
our operations and facilities. We minimize our impacts to the environment by following different 
foundational procedures and ensure we meet our environmental obligations. We launched the 
company-wide EMS in 2012, and in 2020, and we initiated a refresh of our EMS with a focus 
to standardize the structure across all operations, align with other systems like Performance 
Excellence (PE) and Quality, and ensure each part is adding the value intended.

Protecting Forests, Biodiversity and Communities

ADM is fully committed to ending deforestation, and to preserving 
biodiversity and water resources in our supply chains. This includes 
holding our suppliers accountable for producing commodities in 
ways that do not further deforestation in order to reduce impact on 
climate change. We believe that sustainable, ethical and responsible 
production by the food industry is critical for curbing global 
warming, conserving native biodiversity, and upholding the rights 
of indigenous communities and smallholders. We aim to eliminate 
deforestation from all of our supply chains by 2030.

Natural resources are essential to an abundant future, and we are 
striving to reduce the impact of our operations and supply chain 
while making a positive contribution to the wellbeing of people and 
the health of the planet. Our dedication to sustainable practices 
results in a stronger ADM and a better world.

ADM is committed to continuous improvement and to adaptation 
based on the latest science. We began the process of reviewing 
and revising our policy in 2020, and have made improvements to 
reflect current social and environmental standards and stakeholders 
expectations. In March 2021, we released our Policy to Protect 
Forests, Biodiversity and Communities.

At ADM, transparency is a core value. We maintain monthly updates 
to our grievances and resolutions log, through which we publish 
updates on investigations into each inquiry about our supply chains. 
Further, our policy describes ADM’s non-compliance protocol 
for suppliers.

We also publish semi-annual progress reports on focused palm oil 
and South American soy, which contain specific milestones and data 
on progress toward achieving our commitments. Learn more about 
our progress here.

We work to implement programs across our supply chains to 
improve biodiversity and protect forests. Using a risk-based 
approach, ADM has focused initially on its palm and South American 
soy supply chains. Our efforts are organized into four categories: 
supply chain traceability, supplier engagement, monitoring & 
verification, and reporting.

We aim to eliminate 
all deforestation in 
our supply chain 
by 2030.

South American Soy

Transparency and Traceability – In South America, we track 
our soy volumes by country and supplier type – direct or indirect. 
In 2020, we reached 100% traceability for direct suppliers in 
the priority municipalities identified by the Soft Commodities 
Forum (SCF), 85% traceability for direct soy suppliers in Brazil and 
80% traceability for direct soy suppliers in Paraguay. Moving forward, 
we are working to achieve our goal of full traceability for direct 
and indirect suppliers in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay by the end 
of 2022.

Supplier Engagement – In 2020, we continued our sustainable 
farming extension programs for our soy growers. These program 
partners include Produzindo Certo, Sustentagil, and SOJA PLUS, and 
incorporate on-farm assessments and continuous improvement 
through implementation of best management practices. Since 
2009, our programs have reached over 1,000 farmers on more than 
2,500,000 hectares. We have also engaged with growers through SCF 
landscape initiatives with Solidaridad and the Mato Grosso Protect, 
Conserve Include (PCI) Strategy in high-risk municipalities. The PCI 
strategy works to identify the drivers of soy expansion and financial 
mechanisms that could be used to promote sustainable production 
in those regions.

Monitoring & Verification – Since 2018, specialized firms with GIS 
technology (satellite imaging) have been cross -referencing planted 
areas within the farm polygons of our direct suppliers in high-risk 
areas to determine if the soy being sourced is compliant with local 
legislation and our No - Deforestation Policy. Farms are also verified 
to make sure there are no environmental issues (embargoed areas), 
encroachment into protected areas or Indigenous Territories, or 
labor issues which violate our policy.

Reporting – In addition to our corporate reports, as a participant in 
Soft Commodities Forum of the World Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, we publish semi-annual reports along with other 
members to disclose progress toward agreed-upon regional objectives.

Palm

Transparency and Traceability – We source palm products from 
12 direct suppliers coming from 28 refineries and 1,615 mills. We 
maintain high levels of traceability to the mill – over 99% - and have 
been working to increase traceability back to the plantation of origin.

Supplier Engagement – We use a third-party assessor to gather 
data and assess our direct palm suppliers’ performance using a 
scorecard tool. According to the findings, for palm sourced from 
our direct suppliers in 2020, approximately 97% of the volume was 
monitored for deforestation and 99% was covered by human rights 
due diligence. In addition, 100% of our direct suppliers had a publicly 
available No Deforestation policy in place, and 99.3% of palm 
volume was sourced from direct suppliers who have a supply chain 
implementation plan with targets in place.

Monitoring & Verification – We report certified sustainable 
palm oil supplies using the volumes of PO and PKO certified by the 
Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Certified supplies are 
driven by market demand.

Reporting – ADM is a participating member of the IRF Active 
Working Group, allowing us to be at the forefront of driving 
progress. Beginning in 2021, ADM will use the Integrated Reporting 
Framework (IRF) to report and track our progress in implementing 
our No Deforestation commitments in our palm oil supply chains. 
We will soon be able to report the percentage of our sourced 
volumes that are delivering against No Deforestation criteria and will 
therefore be considered verified deforestation free.

 TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

Palm LAB – Colombia

Palm LAB - Labor Assessment Builder 
Program in Colombia
Palm oil is the world’s most popular vegetable oil, accounting for 
more than 30 percent of global vegetable oil consumption. Half of 
all Colombian palm oil produced is exported, and Europe is the top 
export destination. Several international companies have committed 
to supporting 100% sustainable palm oil trade from Colombia, and 
thereby contribute to the advancement of a more sustainable palm 
oil supply for the sector.

The palm sector in Colombia represents around 8% of agricultural 
gross domestic product, generating more than 170,000 jobs and 
indirect economic benefits to around 400,000 people. The producer 
population consists of 80% smallholders, and of all producers, only 
22% of total production is compliant with  Voluntary Sustainability 
Standards (VSS) such as RSPO, ISCC, SA8000, Organic and/or 
Rainforest Alliance.

In 2020, ADM supported a multi-stakeholder alliance coordinated by 
Solidaridad aimed to build an inclusive palm oil value chain between 
Colombian smallholders, processors and international markets. The 
project is developing and implementing a data driven tool that will 
enable around 500 farmers and processors to plan, monitor and 
verify the uptake of labor practices as defined by the VSS and ADM’s 
corporate policies.

Phase one of the project assessed labor and human rights risks in the 
Colombian palm oil supply chain with an aim to identify challenges 
at the mill and farm level and develop digital solutions for workers 
to address these issues. The initial impact assessment included 150 
smallholders, 45 of them women, and 180 workers.

Moving forward, phase two of the project will focus on implementing 
interventions to address risks and challenges identified during the 
phase one assessments, with a specific focus on labor and human 

rights issues. This effort will enable growers to make progress 
toward RSPO certification, ultimately increasing the amount of RSPO 
certified palm supply from Colombia to European markets.

Based on the outcomes of the phase one assessment, an improvement 
plan will be developed by the participating companies, including:
 • Development of a policy to respect human rights, including 

prohibiting retaliation against Human Rights Defenders along 
with documented communication to all levels of the workforce, 
operations, supply chain and local communities, including specific 
prohibition on intimidation and harassment by the mill and its 
providers, including contracted security forces.

 • Implementation of non-discrimination and equal opportunity 

policies to prevent discrimination based on ethnic origin, caste, 
national origin, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, union membership, political affiliation or age.

 • Establishment of a gender committee to raise awareness, identify 

and address issues of concern as well as opportunities and 
improvements for women.

 • Publication of a statement recognizing freedom of association and 

the right to collective bargaining for all workers.

 • Establishment of specific labor policies and procedures to protect 

temporary or migrant workers

 • Development of trainings for smallholders on workplace 

discrimination, harassment and abuse as well as on the importance 
of maintaining and conserving HCV area, minimizing human-
wildlife conflict, and recognizing rare, threatened and endangered 
species and important ecosystems.

Sustainable Agriculture

Food is fundamental. It sustains us, fulfills us and fuels our wellbeing. 
It’s the most basic need with the most critical impact. To ensure 
we are able to feed a growing global population for generations to 
come, it is essential to work with suppliers to implement sustainable 
agriculture practices. At ADM we recognize the opportunity we have 
to work together with our growers to identify and implement farming 
practices that can reduce environmental impact, sequester carbon in 
the soil, and improve on-farm economics and labor conditions.

Sustainable agriculture practices often have multiple positive outcomes. 
For example, cover crops can sequester carbon, lowering GHG emissions 
while also reducing soil and nutrient run-off, protecting our growers' 
most vital assets. In a similar fashion, reduced tillage can protect 
soil from wind and water erosion, and over time, it can improve soil 
resiliency adding a long-term benefit for growers. These types of 
sustainable agriculture practices are critical to ensuring a viable supply 
chain into the future, while also reducing environmental impacts. 

Sustainable agriculture is a key topic for ADM because it contributes to all 
five of the SDGs we've identified as core for our business.

 • Zero Hunger: Improving the resiliency of our food supply chain to 

feed a growing global population 

 • Clean Water and Sanitation: Reducing soil and nutrient run-off to 

improve water quality and protect drinking water sources 

 • Decent Work and Economic Growth: Educating and enabling 

growers to protect smallholder resources and increase income 

 • Climate Action: Implementing practices to reduce direct emissions 

and sequester carbon in soils

 • Life on Land: Protecting forests and biodiversity to 

preserve ecosystems

Our commitment to sustainability extends throughout our value chain. 
It includes our work with growers to implement responsible farming 
practices including the 13 million acres we’ve enrolled in sustainable 

agriculture programs across five continents in recent years. For 
example, in South America, working with Aliança da Terra, we have 
engaged over 6.5 million acres to address local issues such as labor 
and safety practices and environmental protection. 

We represent a unique position in the supply chain – as an aggregator 
and processor of commodities, we can leverage the relationships we 
have with our customers, upstream and downstream to implement 
sustainable agriculture programs. Our approach recognizes and 
accommodates the variances in commodities and geographies from 
which we source; not all practices are a good fit for every farm.

We participate in several certification and rating programs, including 
ADM Responsible Soy, 2BSvs, Round Table for Responsible Soy, 
International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Roundtable 
on Sustainable Palm Oil, Sustainable Agriculture Initiative – Farm 
Sustainability Assessment, Red Tractor, Food Alliance, and Fair Trade. 

In addition, we work with downstream customers to implement customized 
and targeted sustainable agriculture projects based on education, outreach, 
and continuous improvement. These programs focus on specific outcomes 
such as irrigation efficiency, carbon reduction and sequestration, or water 
quality impacts. We have identified four key practices that can provide 
positive outcomes in several or all of these areas – complex crop rotations, 
nutrient management plans, reduced tillage, and cover crops.

Working across 11 active projects in the United States, we engaged 
growers representing over 800,000 acres of corn, soy and wheat in 
2020. We continue to focus on implementing projects that educate 
and incentivize positive change. In addition to direct financial 
incentives, we partner with agronomy specialists to provide technical 
assistance to ensure growers have support and success when 
implementing new practices. Three of our projects are collaborative 
efforts with down-stream customers focusing on increasing the 
usage of cover crops. In 2020, growers in these projects planted over 
130,000 acres of cover crops reducing nutrient run-off and soil erosion 
while sequestering carbon in the soil.

 • External Audits – As a part of the certification process, auditors from 
EcoCert visit a random selection of farms to inspect and verify farm 
practices are in compliance with organic certification standards.

In 2019, ADM assisted the first cohort of growers with organic 
certification.  The group included 1,200 farmers with 1,150 hectares 
of crop land.  Last year, we added 2,550 farmers covering an 
additional 2,600 hectares. In 2021, we are aiming to reach 
5,000 farmers covering 4,850 hectares.

 INDIA TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

Driving Sustainable Soybean Production in India

For nearly two decades, ADM has worked with local partners and a 
group of smallholder farmers to develop a more sustainable value 
chain for soybean production in the Indian states of Maharashtra and 
Karnataka. By promoting effective and environmentally-responsible 
soy farming, the program empowered local suppliers to improve 
productivity, increase yields and become more self-reliant. In fact, 
ADM’s efforts have delivered incredible results. Soybean acreage 
in the area increased from 7,000 hectares in 2001 to 400,000 
hectares in 2020, while yields per hectare have grown by 50 percent. 
And it’s meant a significant increase in income for farmers and an 
improvement in the quality of life for thousands.

Participating farmers received comprehensive training on sustainable 
farming practices, support from the local government and 
universities in sourcing quality seed stocks and financial assistance 
to produce their own planting materials. In addition, they gained 
access to a sustainable credit provision from banks, which aimed to 
promote investment in environmentally responsible farming.

Some of the activities driven by ADM include:

 • Enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs for farmers by 

promoting mechanization

 • Providing dedicated training programs for female farmers

 • Training on environmentally responsible agricultural practices such 
as improving soil health, promoting water conservation techniques 
and maintaining ecological balance

 • Helping farmers improve the quality of their home-grown seeds, 

encouraging self-reliance and circular sourcing

 • Reducing post-harvest losses via training on proper storage practices

More than 250,000 producers in Maharashtra and Karnataka are 
now registered as vendors with ADM.

Recently, we added a new component to this project: enabling 
organic certification. We are working directly with growers to 
support them through the process of certifying their farms.  The 
project has six stages –

 • Farmer Identification – Through the extension services provided 

to the farmers’ groups, we identify progressive farmers and those 
already following organic practices from our registered supplier 
base of 250,000 growers.

 • Field Evaluation – We visit the farms of the grower candidates to 

discuss farming practices, including chemical usage and willingness 
to comply with organic certification requirements.

 • Selection and Registration – If a grower has demonstrated 

that practices can meet certification and expressed interest in 
certification, we assist with the registration process.  This includes 
verification of farm ownership and GPS coordinates of the farm.

 • Training – We coordinate with local experts from agricultural 
universities to provide field-level training for growers on the 
identification, verification and application of manure and approved 
off-farm products.  ADM field staff conduct training sessions on 
certification standards, documentation requirements, and how to 
maintain traceability and organic purity.

 • Monitoring and Inspections – To ensure growers are adequately 
prepared, each farmer receives and internal inspection for each 
crop. Since many growers have two growing seasons per year, this 
means two inspections.

TARGET
GHG Emissions

GHG Emissions
Each year, we inventory and 
calculate Scope 1 (direct emissions 
from our equipment) and Scope 
2 emissions (from the electricity 
and steam we buy from local 
utilities) globally for facilities 
under our operational control. 
With global operations, we select 
regionally-appropriate factors from 
the International Energy Agency, 
United States Environmental Protection Agency, or The Climate Registry, 
unless the facility has Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems which 
take precedent. Our assessment includes all six Kyoto protocol gases, plus 
additional refrigerants and is based on The Climate Registry, except where 
otherwise required by law, such as the US EPA Part 98 Mandatory Reporting 
Rule. We currently use location-based Scope 2 calculations, although we are 
assessing market-based mechanisms to reduce our footprint and will adjust 
our reporting in the future as needed.

For our Strive 35 goals, we established a new baseline year of 2019 because 
it was the most recent, full year of data available while conducting the 
carbon reduction feasibility study that informed our goal setting process.

At our Decatur, Illinois facility, we operate a carbon sequestration well 
that has the capacity to permanently sequester 1.1 million metric tons 
of CO2 annually. The amount of CO2 sequestered is subtracted from 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to calculate our total global emissions. 

In 2020, we saw an 8.9% reduction in absolute GHG emissions. 
Although we implemented several energy efficiency projects in the 
previous years and are starting to see the results of those efforts, the 
majority of the reduction in emissions came from the shutdown of 
our dry corn mills in the U.S. The mills were not in operation for three 
quarters of the year, although in Q2 2021, they resumed operation.

Energy

TARGET
Energy Intensity
15%

In 2020, as a part of our Strive 
35 sustainability goals, we 
announced our goal to reduce 
energy intensity per ton of 
product 15% by 2035 over a 2019 
baseline. We have identified three 
pathways to conserve energy 
and reduce our GHG footprint: 
purchasing renewable energy, fuel 
switching, and energy efficiency 
initiatives. With the vision and scope defined, we set a 5-year interim 
target to reduce energy intensity 6% by 2025. This provides a guiding path 
and helps ensure continuous progress toward our goal.

Reduction in energy 
intensity per ton of  
product produced
at our largest sites by 2035 
over a 2019 baseline

To calculate our energy consumption, we gather information on all facilities 
under our operational control using a combination of utility bills, operations 
data tracking systems, and fuel purchase records. Total consumption is 
made up of renewable fuel consumption (biofuels such as wood and 
biogas burned onsite); non-renewable fuel consumption (fossil fuels 
burned onsite); electricity consumption (purchased from utilities or power 
providers); and steam consumption (purchased from utilities or other 
off-site providers). The fuels burned onsite are used to generate steam and 
heat, as well as electricity at locations with cogeneration facilities. To ensure 
proper accounting, any electricity produced by our cogeneration facilities 
that gets sold to the grid is subtracted from our total energy consumption.

In 2020, we implemented more than 50 energy saving projects across 
various business units that will result in annual cost savings of more 
than $12.4 million while reducing over 273,400 MWh of energy 

and avoiding around 117,000 metric tons of GHG emissions. We 
conducted our yearly Energy Treasure Hunt Program virtually at eight 
of our locations and implemented changes in control strategies and 
operating procedures that resulted in energy reduction of 108,900 
MWh. We have also instituted multiple capacity enhancement 
projects to improve productivity and save energy by repairing, 
upgrading or replacing inefficient equipment. Examples include:

 • Compressed air studies and leak identification/repair 

efforts – Compressed air systems are mostly inefficient but vital 
for our manufacturing facilities. In Latur, India we replaced an old 
air compressor which will reduce 250 MWh of electricity use per 
year. We also completed engineering studies of compressed air 
systems at six facilities in North America.

 • Standardized boiler tuning model at South American 

operations – The boiler-tuning process varies for different biomass-
fueled boiler systems in our South American facilities. We created 
a standardized process for boiler tuning at our facility in Uberlandia 
and then implemented it across all regional systems. Through this 
initiative we expect reduced woodchip consumption equivalent to 
over 71,000 MWh of energy.

 • Combined Heat and Power (CHP) commissioning – 

At our oilseeds facility in Windsor, Canada, we installed two 
high-efficiency gas turbines with waste heat boilers and waste 
heat recovery economizers. These systems are producing 93% of 
the total electricity requirements for the site while also generating 
100% of the steam required. This project resulted in a net 
production efficiency improvement of over 41,000 MWh through 
the deployment of updated cogeneration technology.

Transportation 

To enhance the efficiency of transporting large quantities of 
raw materials and finished products between our procurement 
facilities and processing plants, and also the delivery of products 
to our customers around the world, we operate a large agricultural 
transportation network composed of approximately 680 trucks, 
154 boats, and 32 oceangoing vessels. Our transportation business 
emits approximately 3% of our total Scope 1 emissions. We 
continue to optimize our sourcing and distribution process and to 
reduce our fleet footprint by switching to less carbon-intense fuels 
wherever possible. 

Trucking – In 2020, we started a project to test Optimus 
Technologies’ Vector fuel system, an innovative technology that 
enables diesel engines to run almost entirely on 100% biodiesel. 
We outfitted five ADM trucks with the systems for use in daily fleet 
operations for a one year period – approximately 170,000 miles. The 
project aims to reduce up to 500,000 pounds of CO2. 

While nearly all diesel engine manufacturers support at least 
20 percent biodiesel (B20), the Optimus Vector System is designed 
to allow conventional diesel engines to run on 100 percent 
biodiesel in a wide range of climates. The system is already in use 
in shorter-mileage, local fleet applications such as distribution and 
waste removal. This new project allows us to evaluate its use for 
longer-haul over-the-road fleets, potentially opening a pathway to 
significantly higher volumes of biodiesel in the U.S. truck fleet.

Oceangoing Vessels – The international shipping industry accounts 
for up to 80% of global trade flows and contributes to 2.2% of the 
world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with the figure expected to grow 
by 50-250% by 2050, in the absence of any mitigating measures. To 
reduce the environmental impact of shipping, the Sea Cargo Charter 
was launched to drive sustainable change in the shipping industry. 

In 2020, ADM became a signatory of the Sea Cargo Charter. The 
charter’s principles are aligned with the International Maritime 
Organization’s greenhouse gas strategy to reduce shipping’s total 
annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50% by 2050 
compared to 2008. It provides a standard framework for companies 
to measure and report carbon emissions annually in their shipping 
activities and assess whether shipping activities are aligned with the 
adopted climate goals. Increased emissions transparency is expected 
to accelerate efforts to decarbonize the shipping industry.

Route Optimization – Working with third-party transportation 
providers, we have begun implementing a route optimization 
project. By coordinating routes, eliminating intermediate 
warehousing, and ensuring trucks are loaded to full capacity when 
practical, we are increasing our transportation efficiency and 
reducing shipping emissions in our supply chain. An initial pilot 
assessment in 2020 demonstrated monthly CO2 reductions of 
approximately 100,000 pounds.

Scope 3 (Supply Chain) GHG Emissions

In 2018, we conducted an assessment of our Scope 3 emission profile and identified the top categories where ADM 
focuses its efforts to reduce the supply chain GHG emissions. While considering ADM’s ability to drive change, significance 
to stakeholder groups and absolute contribution of emissions, the assessment identified the below categories as material 
for ADM:

SCOPE 3 GHG EMISSIONS BY CATEGORY

Scope 3 emissions:

37,800,000

Category 4: Upstream Transporta�on and Distribu�on, 5%

Category 5: Waste, 2%

Category 10: Processing of Sold Products/Goods, 52%

NEW

In 2020, we added categories 3 and 5.

Working to address our Scope 3 footprint, we have identified categories 1 and 4 as our greatest opportunity to make 
meaningful reductions. Our direct grower relationships enable us to participate in supply chain collaboration projects 
focused on sustainable and regenerative agriculture. In the U.S., Field to Market is one such alliance, through which we 
drive continuous improvement programs in agricultural practices and systems across the U.S. Through the collaboration, 
we partner with downstream customers to implement projects that focus on supporting farmers in adopting practices 
that address water quality and soil health, such as cover crops, reduced tillage, complex crop rotations, and nutrient 
management to reduce soil erosion, nutrient run-off, and GHG emissions.

We intend to set a Scope 3 reduction target in 2021.

Water and Wastewater

Water availability has become a critical issue in the last few years. 
As we see an increase in regions classified as water scarce or 
projected to be water scarce in the future, the importance of 
reducing water consumption and improving water quality is clear. 
In 2020, we announced our target to reduce water consumption 
by 10% per ton of product produced at our largest sites by 2035 
over a 2019 baseline. In addition, to support the health and 
wellbeing of the communities where we operate, by 2025, we will 
develop a global improvement strategy in priority watersheds. This 
approach will allow us to implement projects where they will be the 
most impactful.

Our Major Water Users Group (MWUG) consists of facilities that 
use more than 400,000 cubic meters of water per year. The MWUG 
makes up more than 96% of our global water usage and are the sites 
for which we calculate water usage and efficiency for our Strive 35 
reduction tracking. We monitor water usage using a combination of 
flow meters and utility billing data. We exclude once-through cooling 
water from our withdrawal numbers because we return the water to 
its original location with only a change in temperature. Although we 
reuse and recycle water through various processes such as cooling 
tower recirculating, for calculation purposes we only include the 
water reused after it has been processed in our onsite wastewater 
treatment facility.

We focus our water intensity 
reduction efforts on the 
MWUG. In 2020, we added 
five sites to the group. We 
implemented ten water 
conservation initiatives across 
the group that helped us save 
935,035 cubic meters of fresh 
water with a cost savings of 
$3.3 million per year. Initiatives 
that we implemented in 
2020 include:

its wastewater for operational needs. This allows us to reduce our 
water withdrawal while also reducing the organic and ammonia 
loads in our wastewater by 80%, and suspended solids by 90%.

 • Upgraded the wastewater treatment performance at our Decatur, 

Illinois complex using ultrafiltration membranes, providing 
additional reclaim water for use across the campus. This initiative 
helps reduce our water usage by 19,000 cubic meters per year.

 • In our Cedar Rapids, Iowa corn plant, we have modified our water 
sampling process to reclaim, clean and reuse the sampling stream 
water instead of sending it to the sewer. This reduces our sewer 
loading and make-up water needs by 24,000 cubic meters per year.

Waste Management

In 2020, we announced our new waste diversion goal. We aim to 
beneficially reuse, recycle or otherwise divert from landfill at least 90% 
of our waste. To achieve this goal, we have focused on developing a 
strategy to standardize our waste management and reporting program. 
We created a Landfill Diversion Team and rolled out our new Strive 35 
Waste Management standard operating procedure. In North America, 
we have engaged a third-party waste management vendor that will 
help us to identify and implement programs on beneficial reuse.

Last year, we diverted 83% of our waste from landfills. Some 
examples of diversion projects include:

Waste to Electricity – ADM colleagues at several facilities 
identified opportunities to divert waste streams for use as fuel for 
electricity generation:

 • Our oilseeds facility in Erith, United Kingdom sent organic wastes 

to anaerobic digestion plants to generate electricity diverting more 
than 1,800 tons of waste per year from landfills. 

 • Our rice facility in Arbuckle, California sent approximately 78,000 

tons of rice hulls to a local electric generation company.

 • In Alejandro Roca, Argentina, our Golden Peanut facility sends over 

21,000 tons of peanut hulls for energy generation annually. 

Beneficial Reuse of Waste – 
At our Decatur, Illinois location, 
we sent more than 2,900 tons 
materials that had previously 
been landfilled to a food 
byproducts solutions provider 
for reuse as an animal-feed 
blend. The plant also signed a 
beneficial reuse agreement for 
oil tank foots, which will help 
us to reuse and divert over 
1,200 tons of waste per year 
from landfills.

Innovation 

Improving Traditional Proteins
Methane Reduction in Cows

Colleagues at our Pancosma facility are researching botanical 
compounds, derived from cinnamon and cloves in addition to capsicum 
oleoresin from chili peppers for their potential to target a key metabolic 
pathway in ruminants that could lead to reduced methane emissions.

In addition to plant-based alternatives, Pancosma is investigating 
the use of organic trace minerals to boost the availability of 
essential nutrients in alternatives to fish-based feeds. Not only 
may the supplemented minerals support shrimp performance 
and production, but they have the potential to reduce the impact 
of shrimp waste on the environment by lowering the amount of 
minerals that are excreted to enable sustainable aquaculture.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming 
potential 25 times higher than carbon dioxide. Studies suggest that 
in addition to its effect on climate change, reducing the amount of 
methane that is released could lead to more energy being made 
available for animal performance. 

Although long-term sustainable shrimp production is complex, 
incremental changes in the supply chain efficiency and sustainability 
can make a lasting impact. Organic trace minerals could play a part in 
developing a more sustainable nutritional solution to support shrimp 
producers in their efforts to provide high-quality food for the world.

Pancosma is currently conducting in vivo trials to quantify the level 
of methane reduction depending on the ruminant species and a 
range of production conditions. Meanwhile, ADM’s Feed Additives 
business is conducting additional studies to identify new potential 
additives which could be of interest to further lower enteric 
methane emissions. In vivo and in vitro studies will be performed in 
ADM research facilities in France and USA.

Sustainable Shrimp Farming

Global demand for shrimp is steadily rising and expected to 
continue. ADM has focused sustainability efforts in aquaculture 
toward using fewer resources, while providing balanced nutrition 
through organic trace minerals. Mirroring the plant-based protein 
trend in human nutrition, one of the main strategies for optimizing 
shrimp production in recent years has been the replacement of fish, 
one of the main ingredients in shrimp feed, with plant and even 
insect-based substitutes. Derived from wild-caught fish, the high 
levels of fishmeal and fish oil can be resource intensive.

Insect Protein

Insect feed has become an increasingly popular protein ingredient 
for the agriculture and aquaculture industries, as demand for animal 
feed has now reached an all-time high and consumers look for food 
that is sustainably and responsibly grown.

In November 2020, ADM, and InnovaFeed — the world leader in 
producing premium insect ingredients for animal feed — announced 
plans to collaborate on the construction and operation of the world’s 
largest insect protein production site, in Decatur, Illinois. “At a time 
when the demand for animal feed protein is steadily increasing, 
insect farming stands out as a true solution for the future,” said Chris 
Cuddy, ADM senior vice president and president of the company’s 
Carbohydrate Solutions business.

Performance Excellence

Manufacturing innovation is the cornerstone of a sustainable 
process. Our operations team takes an innovative approach to 
continuous improvement, using advanced analytical tools to enhance 
troubleshooting and optimization of our processes. While these 
efforts have a significant impact on the bottom line, they also help us 
reduce our global footprint. In 2020, our efforts to improve yield and 
operational stability resulted in lower chemical, energy and water usage. 

Refined Oil Neutralization

Recently, our colleagues in Hamburg took a data-driven approach to 
assess operational performance across our facilities. Leveraging the 
data output, we designed, implemented, then replicated projects 
across the organization.

For example, to improve the performance of chemical additives in 
the oil neutralization process at our refineries in North America, the 
team collected all the relevant process data and wrote a machine-
learning algorithm to model the existing process. Based on the 
model output and after validation by the process experts, we 
implemented new process parameter settings. This allowed us to 
reduce chemical usage while maintaining product quality. 

The recommended processing parameters were implemented at 
several facilities with impressive results. One canola refinery lowered 
its citric acid consumption by 40% during the first month. At a 
corn and soybean oil refinery, the new parameters lowered caustic 
consumption by 94,000 pounds/month. The reduction in citric acid 
usage corresponds to 14 fewer trailers purchased and brought onsite 
each year and the reduction in caustic consumption equates to 24 

fewer trailers. In addition to the chemical savings, the reduction in 
side reactions led to more oil being sold as oil instead of as animal 
feed. Efforts around chemical reduction and yield increases during 
the neutralization process continue across our North America, 
EMEAI, and South America oilseeds facilities.

Wet Mill Operation

Corn wet milling operations are complex processes with numerous 
recycle streams, process constraints, and lots of processes that must 
run ‘just right’ to keep the process stable. This interconnectedness 
means that any adjustment causes changes to many other variables, 
which makes finding optimal values for any one part of the mill 
difficult. By leveraging a model that accounts for all variable 
interactions, ADM optimized all parameters at once, leading to an 
increase in mill starch, protein and oil recovery. This increased the 
amount of product produced without increasing the raw material 
inputs such as corn, chemicals, water, and energy. Moving forward, 
our Focused Improvement and Analytics team will work to replicate 
this optimization model in all ADM wet mills.

By using this innovative, data-driven approach, we optimized 
processes throughout the company, driving value and lowering 
our industrial footprint. By replicating these projects at additional 
facilities, we can quickly bring these benefits to our operations 
around the globe. Our journey does not stop with these projects. We 
will continue to leverage our Performance Excellence team to assess 
and implement projects that protect our environment.

ADM BioSolutions

We are seeing a rapid acceleration of key trends in food security, 
sustainability and innovative nutrition, with global customers 
increasingly wanting global solutions to serve their growing needs 
in traceability, food safety and availability, climate-change mitigation 
and overall nutritional quality. With these trends in mind, we’re 
determined to continue integrating, broadening and globalizing our 
portfolio of sustainable solutions in our efforts to meet customer 
needs and seize growth opportunities in the market. We have 
created a new BioSolutions Platform within our Carbohydrate 
Solutions Business Unit that will focus on plant-based renewable 
solutions for industrial applications such as paper and packaging, 
construction materials, plant health, fermentation and home and 
personal care. This new platform, along with our R&D partnerships, 
have positioned ADM as a key player in the BioSolutions space.

Plant-based Superabsorbent

ADM is working with LG Chem to jointly develop a route to produce 
plant-based acrylic acid. Through ADM’s recent investments in microbial 
solutions and competency in fermentation technology and LG Chem’s 
strength in chemical catalysis, our partnership is poised to deliver a 
bio-based superabsorbent alternative to downstream customers. 
Preliminary analysis estimates this new alternative could cut the 
greenhouse gas footprint of the disposable diaper industry in half.

Replacing Silicone with Terpenes

For many years, silicone polymers — such as dimethicone — have 
been used in cosmetic products to provide smoother coverage, skin 
softening, and frizz reduction, and as emulsifiers and surfactants. 
ADM has partnered with P2 Science, which has discovered a way to 
leverage terpenes (compounds naturally present in citrus plants) as 

a plant-based alternative to silicone polymers. The team at ADM is 
helping P2 make the most of their technology by optimizing access 
to feedstocks. By leveraging ADM feedstocks and technology, we are 
helping P2 position their products competitively in the market. At 
the same time, we are helping our customers reformulate products 
to meet or exceed performance expectations, while providing 
consumers with clean-label, plant-based alternatives.

Renewable Green Diesel

We see a growing interest from our customers to address the carbon 
intensity of the products and ingredients they are using as food 
ingredients, feed ingredients, fuels of the future, packaging materials 
and a whole host of other industrial products as well. To that end, 
we are excited about the expansion of Renewable Green Diesel 
(RGD) and the role we can play as a feedstock supplier and partner 
to RGD producers. In 2020, we saw additional capacity come online 
and more is planned over the next five years. Our expertise in the 
industry has us well positioned to be a go-to partner with innovative 
solutions for our customers. For the foreseeable future, biofuels, 
including RGD, will play an important role in decarbonizing the global 
economy. Using our expertise in biofuels, technology and sustainable 
sourcing, we can reduce the carbon intensity scores of existing 
vegetable oils, integrating our technology into the production 
process and working with growers to lower emissions on the farm.

Introduction

At ADM, we believe our purpose of unlocking the power of nature to enrich the quality of life highlights the significant role 
we play within an essential industry, and the critical job each employee has within the company.

We have upheld our Code of Conduct to ensure the company achieves the right results, the right way. The Code establishes 
high standards of honesty and integrity for all ADM colleagues and business partners and sets forth specific policies to help 
ensure that the company always conducts business fairly and ethically everywhere it operates.

Human Rights

We believe that although governments have the primary duty to 
protect and ensure fulfillment of human rights, ADM plays a role 
in protecting human rights and can act as a force for change in the 
communities in which we operate.

Working alongside key stakeholders, we developed and released an 
update to our Human Rights Policy. The new version aligns the policy 
with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, specifically defining our approach to commit and embed the 
policy in all aspects of our operations and supply chain, conduct 
human rights due diligence, and ensure access to remedy. These 
changes complement the updated Policy to Protect Biodiversity, 
Forests and Communities published earlier this year.

ADM has a direct impact on numerous communities around the 
globe through our sourcing practices, and we focus on mitigating 
threats in areas at higher risk for human rights violations. Using the 
United Nations Human Development Index (HDI) and third-party risk 
assessments, we have prioritized those higher-risk geographies and 
commodities within our global reach.

Although the global pandemic created many challenges in 2020, we 
were able to move forward and implement the next phase of our 
human rights program – onsite assessment. Working with ELEVATE, 
we identified our vanilla supply chain in Madagascar as a high risk. 
During the first half of the year, we worked to develop a vanilla 
sourcing code that outlines our requirements and expectations 
for our vanilla suppliers. We used the sourcing code to develop a 
self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) that was distributed to 1,000 
vanilla farmers that are members of Sahanala, with which we have 
a joint venture called SAVAN. To validate the results of the SAQs, 
we coordinated 63 third-party audits at the farm and grower 
association level.

The results and final reports are expected in the first half of 2021 and 
will be used to develop corrective action and continuous improvement 
plans, where needed. In 2021, we will also identify lessons learned 
and identify additional geographies and commodities to continue with 
assessments to verify supplier compliance with our policy.

ADM is a member of Sedex and hosts responsible sourcing audits 
conducted by 3rd party auditors at our facilities around the globe. 
At the ADM facilities visited in 2020, there were no fees charged to 
job-seekers in exchange for employment, and no collateral was taken 
in the form of money, identification or other personal belongings 
without workers’ consent as a condition of employment by ADM 
or contracted companies. No human trafficking was observed. 
All findings were considered to be minor and low risk. ADM 
sustainability, legal, operations, and compliance teams work with 
the locations to identify and implement corrective actions. In 2020, 
ADM hosted Sedex audits (SMETA) at 11 facilities across Argentina, 
Bulgaria and the United States.

We focus on 
mitigating threats in 
areas at higher risk 
for human rights 
violations.

Compliance and Ethics

At ADM, we believe in making a positive impact.

In February 2021, ADM was recognized by Ethisphere, a global 
leader in advancing the standards of ethical business practices, as 
one of the 2021 World’s Most Ethical Companies. This marks the 
second consecutive year ADM has received this recognition, which 
honors companies who understand the importance of leading and 
prioritizing ethical business performance, and have demonstrated an 
overall commitment to integrity.

We maintain high ethical standards across our global workforce. 
We expect employees to take responsibility for their actions and 
adhere to our values of honesty and integrity, consistent with our 
commitment to always conduct business fairly and ethically.

ADM has established a corporate governance and oversight 
process whereby leaders from compliance, internal audit and 
risk management meet quarterly with the board of directors and 
members of ADM’s executive committee. These meetings ensure 
company leadership is aware of key risks and related risk mitigation 
efforts, drive alignment with the company’s strategic priorities, and 
help protect shareholder interests.

ADM’s Code of Conduct guides us on how to make sound decisions 
and illustrates proper actions for conducting our businesses. Our 
Code promotes a shared understanding of what achieving the right 
results the right way means. By knowing and following our Code, 
each of us does our part to maintain and further build trust with 
our various stakeholders—including our colleagues, customers and 
business partners, shareholders and communities.

ADM prohibits all forms of corruption, including bribery, and we 
abide by all anti-corruption laws in every country we do business. 
We have a robust anti-corruption program that includes a global 
Anti-Corruption Policy and other compliance procedures and 
controls designed to minimize the potential for corruption in ADM’s 
global business dealings, such as enhanced due diligence, screening, 
monitoring of high risk third parties, and pre-approvals before 
hosting or entertaining government officials. We train our employees 
and high-risk third parties to raise awareness of corruption risks and 
applicable anti-corruption laws in order to both avoid inadvertent 
violations of the law and enable early recognition and handling of 
potential issues. Our Anti-Corruption Policy is updated periodically 
to address new risks and incorporate continuous enhancements, 
including an updated policy in 2021.

Each of us does 
our part to maintain 
and further build trust 
with our various 
stakeholders.

We have a strong “Speak Up” culture at ADM, which helps us 
handle issues and address problems in a timely manner, building 
trust with one another and with our customers, suppliers and 
business partners and protecting the company from legal, financial 
and reputational risks. Employees are encouraged to voice 
concerns or ask questions through multiple channels, including by 
talking with their supervisors, Human Resources, or Compliance, 
or at any time through additional reporting channels such as 
The ADM Way Helpline, which is available by phone or web in 
more than 30 languages. Reporting via the Helpline can be done 
anonymously, where permitted by law. ADM does not tolerate 
any form of retaliation for making a good-faith report of actual or 
potential misconduct. The ADM Way Helpline may also be used by 
stakeholders outside of ADM to raise questions or voice concerns.

We feel a deep and genuine regard for the safety and well-being 
of all people, communities and resources, and we treat them with 
care and consideration. We demonstrate trust and openness. And, 
we are good stewards of the environment. Our Human Rights Policy 
protects human rights defenders, whistleblowers, complainants and 
community spokespersons from any form of retaliation.

In 2020, we received a total of 968 reports, concerning topics like 
employee relations, environmental, health and safety (EHS), diversity, 
equal opportunity and respect in the workplace, and misuse or 
misappropriation of assets or information. We log and track all 

reports we receive. Each is classified by type and then assigned to an 
investigator to conduct an independent and objective investigation. 
If an allegation is substantiated, we implement corrective actions 
which can include coaching and counselling, process or control 
improvement, verbal or written warnings, or termination.

Employee and business partner training are important components 
of our compliance program. In 2020, all employees completed 
required compliance training on topics such as anti-corruption, 
conflicts of interest, data privacy and protection, and speaking up.

COVID-19 continued to impact the way we live, do business and 
communicate during these extraordinary times. To more effectively 
manage risk related to our third-party relationships during the 
pandemic, we enhanced our existing third-party training program 
by conducting 21 virtual Vendor Compliance sessions around the 
world. In these sessions, regional business leaders and Compliance 
personnel provided training and engaged in rich discussions with 
approximately 580 vendors, JV partners, customers and other 
business partners on topics such as anti-corruption, conflicts of 
interest, accurate books and records, supplier expectations, human 
rights, privacy, security, and sustainability. And consistent with our 
commitment to ongoing compliance monitoring of third-party 
service providers acting on the company’s behalf, in 2020 ADM 
conducted 24 compliance audits of third-party intermediaries 
around the world.

Food Safety 

Food is fundamental. It sustains us, fulfills us and fuels our wellbeing. 
And the safety and security of our world’s food and feed supply chain 
is of critical importance. That’s why at ADM, we continually review 
and improve our food safety systems and procedures, including 
good manufacturing practices for human and animal food and the 
development and implementation of risk-based preventive controls 
or critical control points based on hazard analyses. Our facilities, 
processes and procedures undergo regular evaluation to assess 
the risk of product contamination, and we implement a variety of 
safeguards and security concepts to reduce those risks. 

We’ve built our Food Safety and Quality program around three 
pillars: achieving best in class food safety, maintaining a culture of 
quality, and leveraging innovation and technology. 

Best in Class Food Safety

Utilizing our customized “Integrated Risk Management” assessment 
application, we proactively monitor and provide focused support 
across the organization through subject matter expertise, resources, 
and global verification procedures to ensure conformance to our 
strict food safety standards.

2020 Achievements

Zero Recalls

Zero Incidents resulting in fines or penalties from 
non-compliance with food regulations or from 
voluntary codes related to the health and safety 
impacts of products or services.

Culture of Quality

Every year, ADM colleagues participate in food 
safety and quality training. In September of 
2020, we held our inaugural Global Food Safety 
Week for our colleagues around the globe to 
provide a dedicated time to refresh and refocus. 
We completed trainings and other activities to 
reinforce and educate our team on the critical 
role we all play toward achieving food safety and 
in delivering quality with every shipment. 

Innovation and Technology

Because food safety has always been a critical 
priority, we are constantly looking for improvement 
opportunities to move from safe to safer. We 
leverage new technologies and process innovations 
to improve food safety through: 

 • Increased ability to detect food safety risks 
 • Improved identification of food safety concerns 
 • Innovative safety controls

in Vietnam. Our shared goals are to support smallholder farmers and 
their families in Vietnam’s Lac Son district by bolstering knowledge and 
skills in poultry breeding, and increasing farmer productivity and profit 
through improved financial literacy and better market engagement.

An ADM Cares grant will provide each participating farmer with a 
support package including 100 fully vaccinated one-day-old chicks, 
a coop and equipment, and high-quality ADM feed. The grant will 
be enhanced with ADM Animal Nutrition expertise: training in 
chicken-breeding techniques, and networking opportunities with 
traders and collectors. Within the framework of this project, World 
Vision Vietnam will work closely with ADM experts in Vietnam and 
local agencies, such as the veterinary stations and the agricultural 
extension stations, to help farmers improve methods and outcomes. 

“We are very pleased to launch this joint project with World Vision 
Vietnam,” said Dr. Pierre Domps, director of marketing & business 
development for ADM Animal Nutrition in Asia. “There are many 
smallholder farmers who battle hunger every day, and we want to 
help increase food security for these families, while helping promote 
sustainable agriculture in the region.”

“With more than 25 years of husbandry experience in Vietnam, 
we’re proud to offer our expertise along with support from ADM 
Cares,” said Dr. Serge Corneillie, general manager of ADM Animal 
Nutrition Vietnam & Cambodia. “Through this project, farmers will 
learn effective poultry-farming methods, have access to high-quality 
products from ADM, and will connect with our traders in the region.”

“This initiative can be adapted and replicated in the future in other 
countries within Asia so that more farmers could have successful 
harvests, while improving their long-term health and well-being,” said 
Domps. “This first collaboration between World Vision Vietnam and ADM 
Animal Nutrition Vietnam will lay a foundation for further joint efforts 
between the two parties in building sustainable livelihoods for families.”

This initiative can be 
adapted and replicated 
in the future.

 TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

Concern Worldwide - LEAF Project

A year ago, we announced a partnership with Concern 
Worldwide—to provide immediate and longer-term 
responses  to chronic malnutrition and hunger for people 
living in extreme poverty in Kenya and Ethiopia. Although the 
coronavirus pandemic has created challenges, thousands of 
new farmers in Kenya are now reaping the rewards of their 
first harvest.

In Tana River County, Kenya, August was a sight to behold. Lush 
green fields featured tidy rows of mungbeans (green grams), maize, 
watermelon, kale and other crops, irrigation canals dug out on 
either side. Just a year and a half ago, this land had been ravaged by 
drought, making livestock production—the traditional occupation 
for most locals—untenable, with animals having little else but dust 
to graze.

“I was born here in Tana River,” said Halima Diramu Jilu, a farmer. 
“Since we started this project, our lives have changed. We have 
planted lots of crops, green grams. We get water from canals... we 
have enough water now.”

The transformation in Tana River has been thanks to the Lifesaving 
Education and Assistance to Farmers (LEAF) Project, built upon 
Concern Worldwide and ADM’s shared goal of advancing nutrition 
innovation globally. The project in Tana River focuses on agricultural 
transformation through skills training, financial aid and continuous 
mentorship. By working with the new farmers, the local government 
and other stakeholders, Concern Worldwide has made major 
strides toward our goal of providing long-term financial stability and 
food security.

“Before, it was bad,” said Ibrahim Murgor, a farmer from Tana River. 
“There was drought. Last year we did not have enough water for 
farming. They have supported us in terms of seeds, other inputs, 
water. All that is sorted.”

In the month of August 2020, nearly 5,000 farmers started 
harvesting their crops: mainly cowpeas, green grams, watermelon 
and maize. The majority of the farmers are reporting above 
average yields. The bumper harvest is because of adoption of 
climate smart agricultural practices, certified seeds and favorable 
weather conditions.

The LEAF project also provides lifesaving nutritional treatment for 
acutely malnourished children and pregnant or lactating women. 
To date, Concern has screened more than 2,500 children and 
mothers for acute malnutrition in Kenya and Ethiopia. Coronavirus 
restrictions have made in-person screenings more challenging, and 
in the coming months, as restrictions are eased, the goal will be to 
increase screenings and intervention, improving on cure rates for 
acute malnutrition.

“We are even more excited about our partnership with ADM than 
we were when we launched the LEAF project one year ago,” said 
Colleen Kelly, CEO, Concern Worldwide U.S. “Our work together, 
especially in Tana River, is bringing the kind of transformation that 
has the potential to last and create better futures for thousands of 
people. Across the region, the need remains great, especially in the 
face of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and in the wake of 
the locust invasions over the last year. But we have achieved proof 
of concept of the ADM/Concern partnership, and we look forward to 
driving even greater impact together, in the next year and beyond.”

Operational Changes

With many employees shifting to remote work during the pandemic, 
our technology and security teams acted swiftly to ensure colleagues 
could maintain secure connectivity using VPNs and laptops and 
installing additional servers and network capabilities.

Our business has had to be nimble, adapting to changing consumer 
behaviors.  For example, our Carbohydrate Solutions business unit 
pivoted production to meet the increased demand for flour for home 
baking, industrial starches for cardboard, and USP-grade alcohol for 
hand sanitizer.

Health and Wellness

COVID-19 Response

Maintaining continuity throughout the food supply chain is essential 
for us to ensure people continue to have access to the nutrition 
they need. At ADM, we play a vital role across the world, and our 
colleagues, especially the front-line workers, have worked tirelessly 
to keep our operations running throughout the global pandemic. 
Our main priority is to ensure a safe working environment for all 
colleagues as we maintain business operations. 

Awareness and Prevention

We have worked relentlessly to increase awareness and prevent 
the spread of COVID-19 within our workplace. At the beginning 
of the pandemic, we held several virtual information sessions for 
employees to help raise awareness of actions that help to prevent 
the spread of the virus. These sessions turned into monthly updates 
for our employees including special guest speakers from health 
organizations with expertise in virology and immunology to discuss 
and dispel fears and myths around vaccinations. 

Many of our office spaces have converted to a virtual format, 
but for operating facilities or locations where in-person work is 
required, we have implemented policies and defined protocols to 
ensure availability of proper resources in case of any positive test 
and ensured effective contact tracing to reduce exposure. We’ve 
taken extraordinary steps to make all workplaces safe for colleagues, 
including enhanced sanitation, readily available hand sanitizer 
and masks, and physical spacing and barriers if necessary. Where 
we provide transportation for employees, we increased services 
to enable appropriate social distancing. In the U.S., we partnered 
with the University of Illinois to implement SHIELD testing – a 

faster and more cost-effective virus test that uses saliva rather 
than nasal swabs. More than 3,000 employees have participated in 
SHIELD testing. 

Extended Employee Benefits

To assist local health agencies in the fight against COVID-19, we 
introduced a temporary paid-leave policy for our colleagues who 
have specialized medical training and certifications. To prevent the 
spread of the virus, we instituted a paid-leave policy for employees 
required to quarantine due to illness or exposure. We also increased 
medical care coverage for COVID-19 treatments. 

At our facilities where employees continued in-person work, regional 
business unit presidents have provided free snacks, lunch, and food 
baskets with thank you notes. In the Philippines, we arranged free 
shuttle and dormitory service for employees who lived outside of the 
local town.

COVID-19 Relief and Community Support

We have contributed over $1.85 million, including $500,000 to the 
United Nations Foundation’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund 
for the World Health Organization; $800,000 for hunger relief; 
and $150,000 to Shanghai Charity Foundation’s Wuhan, China for 
COVID-19 relief project. We have also donated to communities 
where we operate – in Spain, we donated €17,000 to provide food 
assistance to families affected by the pandemic. Through our grant 
program, we provided approximately $400,000 in emergency grants 
to more than 400 ADM colleagues impacted by COVID-19.

Employee Safety

At ADM, we are committed to providing a safe working environment 
for all our employees and contractors. For the last several years, the 
company has been on a journey to a goal of zero injuries – building a 
safety culture so everyone will go home safely to their families and the 
things that are most important to them. That’s why we’ve set a new, 
ambitious goal: by 2025, we aim to reduce our Total Recordable Incident 
Rate and Lost Workday Incident Rate by 50% over a 2020 baseline.

The Safety & Health team, together with the business units, provides 
education, resources and processes designed to minimize safety and 
health risks and ensure colleagues know how to do perform their 
job duties safely. In 2020, we have spent more than 315,500 hours in 
training on occupational health and safety related topics. 

After almost two years without a fatality, ADM lost five colleagues in 
2020. While the Company has made enormous progress in recent 
years, it continues to take steps to further enhance the safety of its 
workplaces and maintains a goal of zero fatalities. 

In 2020, more than 80% of ADM’s sites completed the year without 
recordable injuries, and more than 90% without lost workday 
injuries. Our Total Recordable Incident Rate increased from 0.72 
in 2019 to 0.77 in 2020, while our Lost Workday Incident Rate 
increased from 0.16 in 2019 to 0.17 in 2020. 

In late 2019, we restructured our environmental, health, and safety 
organization to address areas of opportunity which resulted in an 
enhanced focus on transportation and maritime safety. We also 
launched two efforts to address occupational safety:

 • A cross-functional safety culture team to drive improvement 

through simplification with an initial focus on higher-risk activities.

 • A coaching and mentoring program to provide leadership 

engagement and targeted performance improvement plans at 
underachieving facilities.

In addition to these efforts, we implemented several key initiatives that 
will shape our safety culture transformation in 2021 and beyond:

 • Developed and introduced new, robust Machine Guarding/Control 

of Hazardous Energy requirements.

 • Completed critical updates to our bucket elevator hazard 

monitoring systems. 

Through these actions, we aim to achieve continuous improvement 
in 2021, including a 10% reduction in injuries compared to 2020, 
which will help us on our path to achieve our five-year target.

Nutrition for Wellness

With a growing global population and an expanding middle class, the 
demand for protein continues to rise. As consumers become more 
savvy about where and how their food is made, we are seeing shifting 
consumer preferences and changing personal beliefs. Through our 
OutsideVoice research portal, we have been conducting ongoing 
research to keep tabs on consumer interests, including personal diets 
that incorporate alternatives to traditional animal proteins. 

Air Protein

Air Protein is a new company that has become a pioneer in 
producing meat made from elements of the air -- yes, air. The 
company has developed a unique technology to continually produce 
protein in sustainable fermentation “farms” that can be built virtually 
anywhere on the planet. Air Protein meat can also be produced in 
days, making it highly scalable and extremely planet friendly. 

ADM Ventures, the venture capital arm of ADM, sees potential in 
this new technology and is one of the key initial investors in the 
company. As a global leader in alternative proteins, we are excited 
to leverage our vast experience with fermentation solutions to help 
bring Air Protein’s innovative new ideas to market.

Plant-Based Protein

ADM has teamed up with Marfrig Global Foods, a leading global beef 
producer and the world’s largest beef patty producer, to produce and 
sell vegetable protein-based products in Brazil. Under the deal, the 
companies will work together to develop plant-based products with 
the same taste and texture of beef. ADM brings to the partnership 
a unique system and blend of natural ingredients, flavors and plant-
based proteins to make the alternative burger possible, and Marfrig 
will produce, distribute and sell the products in the food service and 
retail channels.

Marfrig, one of the world’s leading beef producers and the world’s 
largest beef patty producer, owns 70 percent of the venture; ADM, 
a leading global nutrition company, is a 30 percent owner. Marfrig 
will be responsible for finished product production and distribution, 
utilizing its facilities in South America, mainly in Várzea Grande, in 
the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, and its facilities in the United 
States. ADM will supply innovative technical expertise, application 
development and an array of plant-based ingredients, flavors and 
systems from its specialty protein complex in Campo Grande, Mato 
Grosso do Sul, and its network of U.S.-based ingredient and flavor 
facilities, including its new pea protein plant in Enderlin, North Dakota. 

Imagine Meats – Plant-Based Protein in India

ADM has launched Imagine Meats, an innovative plant-based 
venture in partnership with Bollywood stars in India. 

Imagine Meats is focused on creating traditional Indian dishes using 
meat alternatives. Rather than supplying single ingredients for blending, 
ADM offers Imagine Meats bespoke, flexitarian system solutions to help 
achieve the right taste and texture profiles using soy and pea proteins, 
as well as other alternative proteins from ADM’s vast portfolio.

Through our 
OutsideVoice 
research portal, 
we have been 
conducting ongoing 
research to keep 
tabs on consumer 
interests.

through customer focus, and delivering outstanding performance for 
shareholders.

At ADM, we bring together colleagues with different backgrounds, 
perspectives, and experiences. These global teams drive innovative 
thinking, creating growth opportunities through diversity of thought. 
Our DEI strategy includes four focus areas: Leadership Engagement 
& Communication, Recruitment, Advancement & Retention, and 
Networks & Sponsorships.

Our leadership engagement, training and communication pillar 
has championed DEI by moving from awareness to action through 
storytelling. Guided by our global communications calendar to 
celebrate DEI-related events year round, such as Pride Month, 
International Women’s Day, and the Global Week of Understanding, 
we have been producing stories to inspire colleagues as well as 
provide guidance.

Through our inclusive hiring initiatives, we have established strategic 
partnerships with external agencies that are devoted to recruiting 
talented candidates from underrepresented groups.
