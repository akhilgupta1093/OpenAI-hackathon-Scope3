2021 Reporting Frameworks & SDGs

In this document, we index the contents of  
The Coca-Cola Company’s 2021 Business & Environmental, 
Social and Governance Report to several important 
reporting frameworks and standards.

We prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: 
Core option. This is the eleventh consecutive year that these 
reporting principles have informed our reporting process. 

This report also meets the requirements of the United Nations 
Global Compact Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns 
with the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework, 
which addresses reporting on human rights. References are 
included in the 2021 GRI Content Index.

This is our second report to include an index for the standards 
set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Our 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
index highlights our key public disclosures on climate change, 
in alignment with the TCFD recommendations. The United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) index provides 
information on where our programs most directly contribute to the 
UN SDG goals and targets.

We review our reporting regularly and aim to be as responsive as 
possible to our stakeholders’ feedback.

2021 GRI Content Index 

The GRI Standards provide a globally recognized framework for companies to measure and communicate their environmental, economic, social and governance performance. We prepared this report in accordance with the GRI Standards: 
Core option. This is the eleventh consecutive year that GRI’s principles have informed our reporting process. 

In this report, the GRI General Disclosures are solely for The Coca-Cola Company. For all other disclosures, the scope is identified in the referenced documents. Beyond reporting on performance disclosures required by the GRI, we report on 
additional disclosures important to our broad range of stakeholders.

Additional Reporting Frameworks 
This index highlights where our reporting meets the requirements of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Advanced Communication on Progress and aligns with the United Nations Guiding Principles Reporting Framework (UNGPRF).

The company has a thorough “Water Resource Sustainability” internal standard for each production operation we 
operate within our system. This internal standard includes assessment for water quantity, quality and other respective 
water challenges (where relevant i.e. WASH) and outlining the water-related risks accordingly. From there, each 
operation is required to prepare a mitigation action which is named “Water Management Plan.” Our operations are 
transitioning to this approach within the 2030 Water Strategy. 

For new land purchases and in Mergers & Acquisitions, an Environmental Due Diligence is required including the 
“evaluation of wetlands and endangered species.”

The 2021 Business & ESG Report details our activities on water stewardship and sustainable agriculture which focus on

As a global system that, in 2021, produced 2.1 billion servings a day, we consider the most important part of this 
disclosure to be product safety for the end consumer. Given that we report for the approximately 225 bottling partners 
across the Coca-Cola system, we do not generate all-inclusive, consolidated information for this metric.

However, we applied the following methodology to assess this metric to the best of our ability: we reviewed  
our incident management database and identified a total of 13 matters that had a food safety aspect. We identified six 
incidents that had some contact with regulatory authorities. The total number of incidents that met both criteria is six.

SDGs

The Coca‑Cola Company and The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were first launched in 2015 and are a core part of the agenda developed by the 193 member states of the United Nations to work toward the future we want, one where all people thrive within a 
healthy environment. The 17 goals—geared toward a 2030 timeframe—and their related 169 targets have become an important framework for companies to rally around as they address an array of complex, interrelated global issues. 

We recognize that we cannot achieve any one of the SDGs on our own. Yet, as a global company with a wide supply chain and consumer reach, we have a significant role to play in meeting many of these ambitious aims. We have taken a 
closer look at where we can make direct contributions to the SDGs, whether through collaboration with our partners and industry peers, supplier engagement, or in other places where we have leverage to amplify our positive impacts. 

The following table outlines the SDG goals and specific targets to which we most directly contribute, with links to more information.
