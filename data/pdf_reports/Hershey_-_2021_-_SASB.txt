Note for 2020: Compared to last year, data now represents usage information from 
Hershey’s global manufacturing facilities and owned U.S. distribution centers and 
corporate offices, except for Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. and ONE Brands LLC.

(1) 5,444,712 m3 water withdrawn in 2020 (2.9% in regions of extremely high baseline 
water stress, 9.6% in areas of high baseline water stress)
(2) 872,597 m3 water consumed in 2020 (10.6% in regions of extremely high baseline 
water stress, 38.4% in areas of high baseline water stress)

Note for 2020: Compared to last year, data now represents usage information from 
Hershey’s global manufacturing facilities and owned U.S. distribution centers and 
corporate offices, except for Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. and ONE Brands LLC. 

During the reporting period, we did not identify any non-compliance with 
environmental laws and/or regulations that would give rise to significant fines or 
sanctions.

All Hershey-owned manufacturing facilities were certified against a recognized GFSI 
standard. As such, all facilities are audited annually to assess compliance against the 
provisions of the standards. In all, 14 facilities, including seven in the U.S., two each in 
Canada and Mexico, and one each in Brazil, India and Malaysia, were certified against 
a GFSI standard. There were no major non-conformances identified at any of the 14 
manufacturing facilities. This translated to a major non-conformance rate of 0.0. There 
were 57 minor non-conformances identified across the 14 facilities, resulting in a minor 
non-conformance rate of just under 4.1. Corrective actions were implemented for 
100% of the minor non-conformances identified, and submitted to and accepted by the 
GFSI certifying body for confirmation.

Responsible Growth: Marketing Responsibly page 22

Hershey received $520.79 million in net revenue from our snacks portfolio, which 
includes ready-to-eat popcorn with no artificial ingredients, baked and trans-fat free 
snacks, protein bars and other better-for-you snacks. Additionally, the company also 
offers a variety of sugar-free confection products, which are included within our 
confectionery and confectionery-based portfolio and represented less than 1% of our 
consolidated net revenue in 2020.

We maintain a Food Claims Review Council in the U.S. that acts as a collaborative, 
cross-functional team of regulatory, nutrition and legal partners. The council provides 
guidance with regard to product claims, labeling, marketing and advertising early in 
the innovation process to ensure products are compliant and address consumer needs. 
In providing guidance, the council touches upon a wide variety of topics, including 
nutrition, ingredients, sustainability, responsible sourcing and product certifications.

In calendar year 2020, the company resolved three legal proceedings associated with 
marketing and/or labeling practices for a total of $59,205. Two of the proceedings 
were resolved through settlements in which there was no finding of liability against the 
company. The third matter involved a local government agency’s assessment of a nominal 
penalty for an alleged violation of the country’s advertising law. In all three matters, 
specific corrective actions by the company were unnecessary.

In 2020, 61% of food ingredients sourced (by cost) were certified to third-party 
environmental and/or social standards. Representative standards included: Fair Trade 
USA, Rainforest Alliance, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and Bonsucro. 
More details on Hershey’s sourcing certification achievements by ingredient are available 
on page 30 of the 2020 Sustainability Report.

In 2020, 82 audits were conducted on Hershey Tier 1 supplier facilities and  
297 non-compliances were found:

– 92.3% were minor non-conformances or a 3.34 non-conformance rate

– 7.7% were major non-conformances or a 0.28 non-conformance rate 

Of the major non-conformances found, 13 were related to working hours, six were 
related to fire door safety, three were related to labor agencies and one was related to 
wages and benefits. No instances of forced or child labor have been found to date.

As of the 2020 calendar year:

– For major non-conformances, 39% have been corrected and closed

– For minor non-conformances, 27% have been corrected and closed

We continue to work with suppliers to develop corrective action plans to close  
non-conformances. 

Suppliers were assessed for compliance with Hershey’s Supplier Code of Conduct. 
Hershey requires a 4-Pillar Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA), which is an 
independent third-party social compliance audit, or equivalent as part of our mutual 
recognition program.

Hershey has not yet conducted a water risk analysis of our supply chain but doing so is 
part of our corporate efforts to re-evaluate our sustainability goals to be in line with the 
best available science and data as per our Environmental Policy. We will be conducting 
supply chain water risk foot-printing and mapping this year (2021) and believe there will 
be more to share on this topic next year.

In 2020, Hershey analyzed the global environmental and social risks of our ingredients 
and raw materials alongside spend data to identify priority supply chains for future 
responsible sourcing investments and programming. We identified five priorities: cocoa, 
dairy, sugar, palm oil, and pulp and paper. This prioritization helps us target where we can 
make the biggest impact while best reducing risks in our supply chain. Environmental and 
social sourcing risks associated with these ingredients as well as details on our programs 
to mitigate these risks are available on page 30–32 of the 2020 Sustainability Report and 
our Priority Ingredients and Materials web landing page.
