Monster’s ingredients and products often travel 

long distances, as our freight partners transport 

them from procurement sites to separate manu-

While we aim to keep manufacturing and sales

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION/  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTReuse

 › U.S. — Our kitchens have switched from polysty-

rene to recyclable containers, and almost all  our 

single-use tableware is compostable. In 2021, we 

installed refillable water stations at our Coro-

na offices so that team members can fill their 

reusable water bottles throughout the day. This 

project is estimated to eliminate over 750,000 

plastic bottles annually and will help transition

environmentally conscious initiatives that incor-

porate sustainable sourcing and the principles of 

reuse, reduce and recycle. For example, the team 

salvages cardboard from inbound shipments 

or waste products (e.g., bean bags) to use for 

outbound shipments in instances where reused 

packaging is acceptable. The team also uses 

pressed wood pallets that are made from recycla-

 › U.S. – At our corporate headquarters, recycling 

bins are available throughout our offices to en-

we also started an electronic waste (e-waste) 

collection drive. In 2021, our corporate head-

from batteries to laptops and printers.

ENERGY USE 

We consume electricity in our buildings in many 

ways, including lighting, climate control and equip-

ment use. Other direct and indirect energy sources, 

such as natural gas, diesel and propane, are used 

to heat our buildings, power equipment and run 

our vehicle fleet. When calculating our global en-

ergy consumption from direct and indirect sources, 

we used utility invoices for electricity and natural 

gas consumption and transactional records for fuel 

consumption. For sites in which square footage 

data was unavailable, we have applied an average 

square footage by facility type to estimate the 

size of the facility before estimating the energy 

consumption.

We have estimated the direct and indirect en-

ergy consumption for approximately half of our 

sites due to unavailability of data. We have also 

recalculated our energy consumption for 2020 

to be consistent with our current calculation 

methodology. On this basis, direct and indirect 

energy consumption decreased. While office 

closures from the ongoing COVID-19 pandem-

ic have contributed to a decrease in energy 

consumption at our office sites, our updated 

methodology has provided us with a more 

accurate estimation of year-over-year energy 

consumption changes.

Bottler and Distributor Insights: The Coca-Cola 
Company and System Bottling Partners 

In 2021, all of Monster’s finished goods were manufactured by third-party bottlers and co-packers. We also have 
agreements with bottlers/distributors to distribute our products. All distribution territories in the U.S., and the majority of 
distribution territories internationally, are under The Coca-Cola Company system of bottlers/distributors. The Coca-Cola 
Company system of bottlers/distributors has made impressive progress on sustainability. 

Some highlights on energy and GHG action include: 

 › The Coca-Cola Company, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company 

(CCHBC), Swire Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola FEMSA have all set science-based targets.

 › The five CCHBC facilities in Europe who manufacture for Monster consumed 99 percent of 

their total electricity from renewable and combined heat and power sources.

 › 85 percent of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s electricity requirements for its manufacturing operations are 
sourced from renewable energy, nuclear energy, combined heat and power, and natural gas.

 › Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Partners accelerated their “Green Fleet Programme” in 2021 by introducing 
battery and plug-in electric car models in 15 countries. Sixteen percent of their light fleet is now 
made up of more environmentally friendly models, helping them achieve a reduction of CO2 emissions 
in grams per kilometer of 7 percent compared with a 2019 baseline. Across its heavy fleet, CCHBC 
has reduced their CO2 footprint by 11 percent compared with the same 2019 baseline.

 › All Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Partner facilities are Alliance for Water Stewardship certified Gold or Platinum.

Bottler Insights: Asahi Group Holdings

In May 2021, the Monster Sustainability Task Force had the opportunity to 
engage and discuss with one of our key independent bottlers in the APAC 
region and our top distributor in Japan, Asahi Group Holdings, on their ESG 
goals and best practices. We also attended a virtual tour of Asahi Soft 
Drink’s Gunma factory in Tatebayashi-City, Japan, where certain Monster 
products are manufactured.

Asahi has taken many positive steps to reduce their environmental 
impacts including:

 › Switched to renewable energy in April 2021 at the Gunma 
factory, which produces for Monster, joining other Asahi 
plants that also use renewable energy. As a result, Asahi 
has reduced the amount of purchased electricity at the 
domestic group facilities by approximately 40 percent. 

 › Set science-based targets to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions by 50 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050.

 › Achieved the CDP “A List” in both the Climate 

Change and Water Security programs.

Water is the number one ingredient in all Monster 

products.  At Monster, water is more than just an 

invaluable natural resource; it is at the very core of 

our business. 

As Monster continues to grow, we must ensure that 

all new facilities are designed with significant water 

efficiency features — as is the case with our new 

AFF production facility in San Fernando — while we 

continue to minimize waste in our existing loca-

tions.

We recognize that access to clean, safe drinking

better stewards of our water use across our busi-

ness, in the supply chain and in our personal lives

that positively affects our surrounding community. 

These programs include initiatives such as installa-

tion of low-flow toilets and minimizing the use of 

water for landscape irrigation. We are continually 

assessing the risks due to water scarcity in the state 

Since moving to our current corporate headquar-

ters in 2013, we have improved our ability to 

monitor water consumption and have implement-

ed technologies to reduce on-site water usage. In 

2016, we installed water efficiency technologies

MONSTER BEVERAGE CORPORATION/  2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORTwhich saves approximately 200,000 gallons of wa-

ter annually. Our buildings also use high-efficiency 

irrigation systems, xeriscaping principles, low-flow 

hand sinks and optimized restroom fixtures (SASB 

FB-NB-140a.2).

At AFF, water use is tracked for total volume con-

sumption and is broken down into three usages: (i) 

finished product usage, (ii) effluent water and (iii) 

process equipment water consumable for boilers, 

cooling towers and refrigeration condensers. Be-

cause of the nature of AFF’s business, it does not 

use recycled water in its facilities and instead uses 

100 percent source municipal water from the city 

of Los Angeles. Water quality is checked through 

both in-house testing and use of annual water 

quality reports for the Los Angeles County Water-

works District. Effluent parameters, such as pH and 

total discharge, are also monitored.

WATER ACCOUNTiNG

Monster completed its annual water inventory for 

direct operations for 2021. Some of our sites — mainly 

our AFF production facilities — have metered water 

withdrawal and discharge. For these facilities, usage is 

based on empirical data from utility bills. To estimate 

water withdrawal and discharge at our non-metered 

sites, we calculated the average intensity based on 

square footage and facility type (e.g., production fa-

cility or office) using data from our metered sites. We 

were able to improve the quality of our data this year, 

and we aim to keep improving in future years.

In Our Operations

We are committed to setting a water-related goal 

and policy by the end of 2023 with the aim to 

increase measurement of our water-related impacts 

by improving our water data, including reaching 

out to suppliers, co-packers and bottlers on their 

water use information.

To better understand our water impacts, we have 

conducted a water risk assessment covering our 

direct operations using credible, publicly available 

tools such as the WWF Water Risk Filter and the 

World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct tool. 

These tools allow us to assess how water risk and 

water stress occurring at the baseline level may 

affect operations and evaluate risk over a variety of

better mitigate and manage our water footprint 

(SASB FB-NB-140a.2). 

In Our Supply Chain

A substantial component of our water footprint 

comes from indirect water use consumed in the 

manufacture of our products. One of the ways we 

manage these risks is by requiring suppliers to 

adhere to the Supplier Code of Conduct (SASB 

FB-NB-140a.2). In 2021, we began initial assess-

ments of our water-related trends in our supply 

chain through publicly available reports, data and 

tools. We conducted a water risk assessment on 

our co-packer and bottler facilities located in the 

EMEA using the WRI Aqueduct tool and the WWF

WORKPLACE HEALTH 
AND SAFETY

Monster prides itself on its healthy work environ-

ment. We aim to comply with applicable health and 

safety requirements to minimize risk of accidents, 

injury or any workplace health hazards. All full-time, 

part-time and temporary Monster team members 

are covered under occupational injury and illness 

programs or workers’ compensation insurance. 

We aim to foster a workplace that is free from vi-

olence, harassment, intimidation and other unsafe 

or disruptive conditions due to internal or exter-

nal threats. We are committed to providing fair 

and equitable remediation should circumstances 

require. 

Our subsidiary, AFF, coordinates with the Occu-

pational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 

on a regular basis to ensure a safe and healthful 

workplace. AFF also has several training programs 

in place that promote a safe environment, cover-

ing topics such as hearing conservation, confined 

COVID-19 Safety

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 

March 2020, our top priority has been the health, 

safety and well-being of our team members. In 

2021, we continued to implement global trav-

el restrictions and work-from-home policies for 

team members who were able to work remotely. 

Where possible, team members were provided 

with equipment to facilitate home-based work. For 

team members who were unable to work remotely, 

we implemented safety precautions which were 

developed and adopted in line with guidance from 

public health authorities and professional consul-

tants in the relevant countries. For example, where 

possible, we provided on-site COVID-19 testing 

for team members at select offices and facilities. 

On June 1, 2021, we instituted a phased return to 

in-person work for office-based team members at 

our corporate headquarters. During the first phase, 

the following initiatives went into effect:

Mentorship

We offer mentorship programs which are de-

signed to inspire, motivate and guide talent 

within our operations. From 2020 to 2021 alone, 

Monster saw a 25 percent increase in the num-

ber of program participants in the Americas, 

APAC and LATAM regions. Approximately 600 

team members participated in this program in 

recommendations for 2022, including the addition 

of EDI criteria in the application process and the 

inclusion of peer-to-peer mentoring for new hires 

to accelerate the onboarding process.

Monster Business Academy

The Monster Business Academy provides team 

members with access to numerous online, self-

paced, on-demand courses and training programs, 

as well as leadership training sessions designed to 

build management and professional skills. In 2021, 

22 team members participated in the program at 

Vanderbilt or Cornell University with the aim to 

promote fresh perspectives for our organization’s 

future success. In a feedback survey sent out to 

participants after the program’s completion, 92 

percent of respondents stated that they are likely 

to recommend the program to other members of 

the Monster Family.

Leadership and Development needs assessment. 

Monster’s public speaking development program, 

gives team members an opportunity to improve 

their communication and leadership skills. Previ-

ously held in-person, this program transitioned to 

a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic 

and is currently being revised to expand and boost 

participation. In the future, an in-house master 

certified facilitator will lead the training.

Training

We also executed training for our team members 

on topics such as sexual harassment, diversity, 

equity and inclusion, racial justice, and unconscious 

bias.

Tuition Reimbursement

Recruitment

Eligible team members are provided the benefit of 

up to $5,000 in tuition reimbursement to pursue 

higher education, certification and other training 

programs that may benefit their work. In 2021, we 

had 30 team members in the U.S. utilize the tuition 

reimbursement program. 

The Monster brand represents being the best at 

what our team members do, and we always aim 

to hire the right person for the right position. 

We look at attending job fairs that target diverse 

candidates. We also developed a specific nine-step 

training program for hiring managers to consider 

when interviewing potential candidates (further de-

scribed under the Leadership and Team Develop-

ment section). We do not discriminate on the basis 

of race, religion, gender, age or sexual orientation. 

We post job openings on our website as well as on 

social media, attend and hold job fairs, work with 

our team members for referrals and use recruit-

ment specialists.

Monster is proud to support the communities 

in which we operate. Our philanthropic effort is 

managed by our Vice President (V.P.) of Philanthro-

py through our Monster Energy Cares Foundation. 

Our philanthropic platforms include social responsi-

bility, as well as supporting active duty, injured and 

retired U.S. military personnel, Monster athletes 

and their charities, our local communities and first 

responders. In 2021, we continued to grow our 

social responsibility as a platform of Monster Ener-

gy Cares by developing three social responsibility 

teams globally who help oversee our engagements 

ders, American Cancer Society and the Society of 

St. Vincent de Paul. The EMEA team also donated 

to 46 charities including the British Heart Founda-

tion, Harrow Food Bank and World Wildlife Fund 

(WWF), with 54 team member donations matched.

We also encourage our team members to explore 

their philanthropic passions by providing each full-

time member of the Monster Family with one paid 

volunteer day off per year to work with their cho-

sen charities. We are proud of our team members 

who hold positions of leadership throughout the 

community and donate their time, expertise and fi-

nancial resources to an array of initiatives. In 2021, 

U.S. team members completed more than 1,300 

hours of volunteer work. In EMEA, team members 

completed almost 350 hours.

including police officers, firefighters, paramedics, 

hospital workers and SWAT team members. We 

also sponsor events commemorating the sacrifices 

first responders make on a daily basis.

Uncompromising On Quality

Our team readily adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In 2021, we performed supplier quality audits using mixed reality technology. We conducted 37 audits across North America, EMEA, APAC and LATAM, most of which were done 
virtually through Microsoft HoloLens®, a mixed reality smart glasses device.

Our pursuit toward quality remains unabated. We aim to follow the standards on drinking water set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. The vast majority of our beverages use water that has been treated with a reverse osmosis system. Additionally, contract manufacturers undergo a thorough validation 
process to ensure adherence with our strict quality guidelines, and we sample products throughout the manufacturing process.

96 percent of our co-packers are certified to the standards set forth by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GSFI) and our subsidiary company AFF holds numerous certifications 
to ensure we are meeting or exceeding industry-specific standards. AFF sites operate under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points 
(HAACP) system, through which we evaluate and improve our food safety practices. As of 2021, AFF is certified to the following standards and accreditation programs:

 › Department of Halal Certification Europe
 › HAACP Food Safety Certified Staff
 › Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA)
 › OU Kosher
 › Quality Assurance International (QAI) Certified Organic

Increase Circularity of Packaging

Monster encourages and supports industry efforts 

to enhance the circularity of packaging. Several of 

our suppliers, including Ball Corporation (Ball), are 

actively incorporating circularity into their manu-

facturing processes. 

In 2021, Monster Energy Sustainability Task Force 

members participated in seminars and meetings 

with Ball to discuss collaboration to expand light-

weighting efforts, to increase the use of recycled 

cans in the can manufacturing process, and to 

improve levels of recycling of aluminum cans. We 

are committed to looking for further opportunities 

to expand lightweighting efforts to reduce the 

amount of material required to deliver our prod-

ucts to consumers.

In addition, Ball’s comparative life cycle assessment 

challenges the traditional ways sustainability has 

been measured in the beverage packaging indus-

try. The methodology compares real recycling data 

for four of the most popular beverage packaging 

materials – aluminum, PET, glass and cartons – 

across three key geographies: the U.S., Europe and 

Brazil.

We are excited to have Ball as a supplier with their 

robust sustainability goals and strategies, including 

a focus on improving product stewardship, support 

of targets approved by the Science-Based Target 

Initiative, and development of a net-zero emission 

roadmap.

COMPENSATiON

Our executive compensation program is designed 

to reinforce ownership and overall entrepreneurial-

ism, and to link rewards to measurable corporate 

and qualitative individual performance. The pro-

gram’s primary objectives are to:

 › Motivate and retain executive talent;

 › Reward executives fairly over time for perfor-

mance relative to business plan goals; and

 › Create sustainable stockholder value through 

continued profitable growth. 

The executive compensation program is overseen 

by the Board of Directors’ Compensation Commit-

tee, which is comprised entirely of independent 

directors. 

In 2021, we continued the implementation of our 

revamped executive compensation program, which 

is more objective than our historical approach to 

the program. Each of our named executive officers 

(NEO) once again had a pre-established target 

bonus opportunity as part of our annual incen-

tive award (AIA) program for short-term annual 

incentive compensation. In addition to the AIAs, 

the Compensation Committee approved long-

term annual incentive compensation, specifically 

grants of performance share units (PSUs), which are 

the Company’s first grants of PSUs eligible to be 

earned based on the Company’s three-year cumu-
