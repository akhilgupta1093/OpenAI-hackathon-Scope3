Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain

There were no significant changes to the organization and its supply chain in 2021. There were no significant changes to structure or 
ownership during the reporting year.  
As we transition to an all-electric future, we are investing to increase EV manufacturing capacity and retool facilities across North 
America and China. 
Similarly, as we expand EV programs we are strategically reviewing our supply chain. 

Precautionary Principle or approach

GM does not follow the precautionary approach, but has a comprehensive risk management plan in place.

A combination of municipal, wells and surface water are sources for GM’s water withdrawal. Water is critical to automobile production 
and to building occupants for drinking water and hygiene. Local facility knowledge provides information on water supply impacts for 
current operations, and we engage in the use of WRI Aqueduct for future forecasting. Risks in current operations are mitigated with 
alternate supply, working with local utilities, conservation or process water reuse. GM engages with over 300 suppliers through CDP 
Water Supply Chain and other organizations like AIAG. Company goals were set to continuously improve and reduce intensity from  
2010 to 2035 by 35%. Water is integrated into our business plan, and each facility has a target for year-over-year reductions.

Management of water discharge-related impacts

Water withdrawal

Reference/Response

General Motors maintains an environmental performance criteria document on water pollution control (EPC-003). Within this 
document, minimum concentration-based performance requirements are defined for wastewater discharge to surface water and 
for wastewater discharges to external wastewater systems. Where local permit limits are more stringent, those supersede the GM 
requirements. Where no permit limit is provided, the performance requirements are used. 

GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilities’ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly 
basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small 
facilities (offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this 
represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source.

GM identifies water stress using WRI Aqueduct model and internal company knowledge. GM measures and monitors 100% of our water 
withdrawals by source from water-stressed areas, using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility 
database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually.

303-4

Water discharge

GM sites must have a system in place to identify wastewater generated and discharged by current activities at the site, and as these 
activities change in the future, sites should also identify any additional potentially contaminated flows from on-site sources.

303-5

Water consumption

See also: Data Center

GM calculates water consumption based on water withdrawal times, an engineering calculation for evaporation of 30%. Using the 
formula withdrawal minus discharge provides close to zero consumption due to groundwater infiltration at plant sites. GM experiences 
water stress at three sites in Mexico and two sites in China. We have mitigated the risk by conservation, recycling or reusing wastewater 
in the manufacturing process. Additionally, at one site in China, the government has provided a backup source of water to mitigate water 
stress risk.

To identify and mitigate human rights risk in the sourcing of these raw materials, our 
due diligence practices undertaken in connection with our Responsible Materials 
Program and our Conflict Mineral Program are aligned with the Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible 
Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. 
We enjoy strong management support for conflict mineral supply chain due diligence.

Governance

Disclose the organization’s governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

a)  Describe the board’s 
oversight of climate-
related risks and 
opportunities.

The General Motors Board of Directors is committed to overseeing the 
company’s integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
principles throughout the enterprise, and oversees the company’s ESG 
risks, priorities and opportunities. 

The Board is committed to sound corporate governance policies and 
practices that are designed and routinely assessed to enable GM to 
operate our business responsibly, with integrity, and to position GM to 
compete more effectively, sustain our success and build long-term 
shareholder value. The Board works with management to integrate 
ESG principles into the company’s business strategy. This includes 
agenda items and discussions related to ESG topics at Board and 
committee meetings.

Expertise related to environmental, social and/or governance-related 
issues, including climate, are among the qualifications considered prior 
to recommending an incumbent, replacement or additional director to 
the Board. 

The Board discharges its risk oversight responsibilities, in part, through 
delegation to its committees. The Board has six standing committees: 
Audit; Executive; Executive Compensation; Finance; Governance and 
Corporate Responsibility; and Risk and Cybersecurity. All standing 
committees of the Board, other than the Executive Committee, are 
composed entirely of independent directors. As a full Board, and 
through these committees, the Board is committed to overseeing the 
company’s integration of ESG principles throughout GM’s business and 
managing the related risks and opportunities. 

Each committee has a written charter setting forth its purpose, 
authority and duties. Overall, the committees enhance the Board’s 
oversight of areas that are critical to GM’s corporate responsibility 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  20

and sustainability efforts, including transparent and reliable financial 
reporting; risk identification and mitigation (including climate change 
and other ESG issues); ethics and compliance; product and workplace 
safety; supply chain and human rights; pay-for-performance; data 
security; diversity, equity and inclusion; Board and management 
succession planning; consideration of shareholder proposals; and 
political and lobbying priorities and expenditures.

In 2021, each Board committee further incorporated ESG responsibilities 
into their charters in recognition that ESG risks are all-encompassing. 
The following committees have climate-related responsibilities: 

Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee (GCRC) 

The GCRC oversees the Company’s development of ESG initiatives, 
strategies, policies and practices related to matters of sustainability 
and corporate responsibility that have a material impact on the 
company. The GCRC is responsible for tracking GM’s ESG scorecard 
and conducts annual reviews of ESG reporting standards, lobbying 
activities, corporate philanthropy and human rights (including 
responsible sourcing practices and policies). In addition, the GCRC 
approves the company’s annual Sustainability Report and associated 
disclosures, including TCFD.

Risk and Cybersecurity Committee (RCC)

The committee oversees risks related to the company’s key strategic, 
enterprise and cybersecurity risks, including climate change, workplace 
and product safety and privacy.

The RCC considers ESG-related risks as part of the company’s enterprise 
risk profile. This includes, but is not limited to, transitions associated with

climate change and achieving our vision of an all-electric future. The 
committee is regularly updated on enterprise risk trends and emerging 
risks, as well as management’s response and/or mitigation plans that 
are being executed.

The Audit Committee (AC)

In addition to its oversight of the quality, integrity and compliance 
of GM’s financial statements, the AC began reviewing the process 
and control procedures for ESG disclosures in 2021. In 2022, the 
committee will begin approving the company’s annual Sustainability 
Report and TCFD response prior to publication. 

Executive Compensation Committee (ECC)

Starting in 2022, the ECC will annually:

•  Evaluate whether the company’s ESG and sustainability 
goals and milestones are effectively integrated into the 
compensation programs.

•  Review compensation plans for executives to confirm 

alignment to GM’s sustainability risks and opportunities. 

•  Consider shareholder feedback relative to the alignment 
of GM’s sustainability goals with respect to the annual 
shareholder say-on-pay vote.

Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C1.1, C1.1a, C1.1b) 
as well as GM’s 2022 Proxy Statement, beginning on page 6, for 
further discussion of Board oversight on ESG measures. 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  21

The company’s risk governance is facilitated through a top-down and 
bottom-up structure, with the tone established at the top by the Board 
Chair and CEO, who is also our chief risk officer, and other members of 
management, specifically the Senior Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT 
also utilizes our Risk Advisory Council, an executive-level body with 
delegates from each business unit, to discuss and monitor the most 
significant enterprise and emerging risks in a cross-functional setting. 
They are tasked with championing risk management practices and 
integrating them into their functional or regional business units.

Sustainability Office (SO)

Management of climate-related risks and opportunities ultimately 
resides with the CEO, who leads our SLT. This group includes the 
executive vice president of global manufacturing to whom our chief 
sustainability officer (CSO) reports. The group is responsible for ensuring 
climate-related considerations are incorporated into the company’s 
overall business strategy and that climate-related risks are considered  
in GM’s enterprise risk management framework and decision-making 
processes. The CSO chairs the SO and works cross-functionally to 
integrate sustainability across the enterprise.

Examples of areas overseen by the SO: 

•  Tracks and monitors execution of public commitments 

made by the company related to sustainability goals such 
as carbon neutrality and approved Science Based Target 
initiatives (SBTi).

•  Works with the enterprise to ensure responsible sourcing 
and consumption of materials and production of vehicles.

•  Coordinates with the business on the strategic design and 
implementation of our electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure.

During 2021, our ESG management teams also continued to expand 
throughout the organization, including individuals with climate 
expertise in areas such as global purchasing and supply chain (GPSC), 
engineering, legal and public policy, among others. We are strengthening 
our internal bench to increase our ability to identify and manage climate-
related risks and continually ensure operational teams are aligning our 
business strategy with our ESG strategy.

CO2 Governance Committee 

GM is focused on reducing CO2 emissions from use of sold products, 
primarily by transitioning its product line to all-electric vehicles. GM 
tracks projected fleet-wide CO2 emissions on a regional basis to ensure 
compliance to increasingly stringent regulations in all our markets. Our 
CO2 governance process includes senior-level representation from all 
relevant functions, including product development, planning, sales and 
marketing, finance, public policy and legal.

Manufacturing Leadership Team (MLT) 

The scale of our manufacturing operations also presents significant 
opportunities for emissions reduction. 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  22

On a monthly basis, GM’s progress toward science-based targets for 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3, as well as other key climate-related indicators, such  
as water and waste, are reviewed and tracked against internal targets 
by the MLT. Progress toward projects and initiatives to support our 
targets are also reviewed by the MLT. 

Local Management 

At the local manufacturing plant level, management is responsible 
for tracking energy consumption and continuously analyzing and 
reviewing opportunities for energy conservation, as well as monitoring 
potential climate-related impacts, including catastrophic risks or 
losses from natural events that may occur at their site. 

Similar analysis and evaluation at the operational level occur when 
selecting new sites as well as considering new suppliers.

Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 (C1.2, C1.2a) for more detail.

Strategy

Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization’s businesses, strategy and financial planning.

a)  Describe the climate-
related risks and 
opportunities the 
organization has 
identified over the 
short-, medium- and 
long-term.

We recognize that our impact as a business extends to the opportunity 
to help people thrive in a better, more sustainable world. That is why we 
are working toward a zero-emissions future, which will require actions 
beyond just accelerating EV adoption. We plan to become carbon 
neutral in our global products and operations by 2040 and eliminate 
tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035. We continue 
working toward our target of sourcing 100% renewable energy to 
power our U.S. operations by 2025 and our global operations by 2035. 

In 2021, GM partnered with a third-party consultant to begin a two-
year journey to better define the company’s climate-related risks and 
opportunities. The focus is to identify climate-related risks, exposure, 
potential impacts and key performance indicators. In particular, this 
journey will include climate change scenarios and business alignment 
with various climate-related scenarios. Progress on this exercise will  
be shared in our 2022 TCFD disclosure.

We categorize risks as physical and transition risks. Transition risks 
result from the global transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient 
economy, while physical risks result from extreme weather events and 
increasing average global mean temperatures. Transition risk related 
to technology results from availability of technology to address  
climate impacts. 

To the right we have identified key climate-related risks and 
opportunities with potential impact to our business over short-, 
medium- and long-term time horizons.

PHYSICAL RISKS

Risk: Increased storms and droughts creating  
production disruptions 

Increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or 
other severe weather events that may result from climate change 
could disrupt our production and the production, logistics, cost and 
procurement of products from our suppliers and timely delivery of 
vehicles to customers, and could negatively impact working conditions 
at our plants and those of our suppliers. Any of the foregoing could 
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results  
of operations.

(cont.)

Approach

We manage these risks based on the location of our operations around 
the world and the risk profile for a particular region. As an example, 
increases in the frequency of drought conditions can depress water 
availability for production in water-stressed areas. GM has production 
facilities in Mexico, an area hard hit by drought in recent years, and 
there is a risk that increases in the frequency of such events could 
disrupt production due to lack of water availability. 

GM has integrated water management into our annual business 
planning process and has set a target to reduce the water intensity  
of our operations 35% by 2035 compared to a 2010 baseline. We  
also have signed the CEO Water Mandate—a UN Global Compact 
Initiative—joining other global business leaders to address key 
challenges around water security and further aligning the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. We also are a long-term reporter  
to CDP Water and have made the “A” list for three consecutive years.

Water consumption is managed on a local basis, with each facility 
working toward its own targets for year-over-year improvement. 
Innovative approaches have allowed facilities to continue production 
without disruptions, even in water-stressed areas. At our San Luis 
Potosí assembly plant in Mexico, GM uses a zero liquid discharge 
system to minimize the reliance on well water. The system purifies  
and transforms wastewater into reusable water for the facility’s paint 
and machining processes, as well as for landscape irrigation.

See our CDP Climate Change 2021 (2.2a, 2.3a) for more detail, and 
learn more about our management of water resources and water stress 
regions in our CDP Water report. 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  24

TRANSITION RISKS
Risk: Reduced availability of raw materials potentially 
impacting costs and scheduling of vehicle production

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, 
freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers across 
the globe to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily 
include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and precious metals. 

Reduced availability of raw materials can lead to increases in prices for 
commodities, raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers 
use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts. 
In addition, any increase in the cost of critical materials for our EV 
propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare 
earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EVs and 
could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. 

Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such 
materials could disrupt our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in 
a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risk, 
fluctuations in supply and demand, any weakening of the U.S. dollar 
and other economic and political factors may continue to create pricing 
pressure for commodities, raw materials and other inputs. 

Approach

In every region in which we operate, local sourcing as a percentage of 
regional spend, which ranges from 73% in South America and other 
international regions to 92% in North America and 96% in China, 
helps us to mitigate certain supply chain risks. Our transition to EVs 
includes building a resilient, scalable and more sustainable North

Risk: Lack of EV charging infrastructure potentially impacting 
consumer adoption

Consumer adoption of EVs will be critical to the success of our strategy. 
This could be impacted by numerous factors, including the proliferation 
of charging infrastructure (in particular public charging stations). 
Also, the failure by governments and other third parties to make the 
investments necessary for infrastructure improvements, such as 
greater availability of cleaner energy grids and EV charging stations, or 
to provide economic incentives promoting EVs, could impact consumer 
adoption as well.

Approach

To support mass market adoption of EVs, we are working to ensure that 
our customers will have access to comprehensive charging solutions. 
For personal vehicles, this means strategically addressing charging 
needs at residences, the workplace and in public locations. For fleet 
vehicles, this means turnkey charging solutions and fleet and facility 
energy management services. 

We have announced collaborative work with several charge network 
operators to filter real-time data on their respective networks and 
charge station health into Ultium Charge 360, a holistic charging 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  25

approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps1 
and other products and services to simplify the overall charging 
experience for GM EV owners Ultium Charge 360 is also available 
to our fleet and BrightDrop customers and offers fleet and facility 
management tools, integration with GM’s fleet management offerings 
and support across a wide range of fleet sizes. 

In 2021, we announced a new Dealer Community Charging Program to 
install up to 40,000 Level 2 EV chargers across the United States and 
Canada through 2025. Working with our dealers, we intend to expand 
access to charging in local communities, including in underserved, 
rural and urban areas where EV charging access is often limited. This 
initiative, which is expected to begin in 2022, is part of our commitment 
to invest nearly $750 million to expand residence, workplace and public 
charging infrastructure through the Ultium Charge 360 ecosystem 
through 2025. The investment includes the addition of 3,250 EVgo DC 
fast charging stalls through 2025.

This could change our manufacturing processes or product portfolio 
Climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in 
international jurisdictions could require further limits to emissions 
associated with customer use of products sold, or make it necessary 
for us to undertake other activities that may require us to incur 
additional expense. 

Part of our strategy to address these risks includes our transition 
to EVs, which is dependent upon customer acceptance, and could 
result in reduced demand for, and therefore profits from, our internal 
combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, which we plan to use to fund our 
growth strategy.

Approach

We are working closely with governments worldwide to implement 
complementary policies to bolster consumer education and incentives, 
infrastructure, manufacturing, clean power, and research and 
development investments that are critical to the success of our all-
electric vision and our broader climate goals. 

To accomplish these advocacy objectives, GM is committed to working 
globally with a broad set of key partners, industry associations, 
coalitions and governmental policymakers at the national, state/ 
provincial and local levels. 

A detailed discussion of our advocacy efforts can be found in our 
Public Policy Supplement.

Risk: Competition from peers in transition to EVs potentially 
impacting company sales and market share

Our EV strategy is dependent on our ability to: deliver a broad portfolio 
of high-quality EVs that are competitive and meet consumer demands; 
reduce the costs associated with manufacturing EVs, particularly with 
respect to batteries; increase vehicle range and the energy density 
of our batteries; license and monetize our proprietary platforms and 
related innovations; successfully invest in new technologies relative to 
our peers; develop new software and services; and leverage our scale, 
manufacturing capabilities and synergies with existing ICE vehicles.

Approach

Continuous innovation and advanced technology development are key 
to keeping up with changing consumer behavior. One way GM achieves 
this is through our global network of R&D labs around the world, as well 
as through active collaboration with academia, suppliers and startups 
to develop new technologies, such as our electrification platform.

GM is committed to developing a broad set of EVs for every lifestyle 
and price point. This will be enabled by our proprietary Ultium 
Platform—a combined EV architecture and propulsion system that 
enables EVs at scale. This platform can power transportation from 
family vehicles to luxury vehicles, work trucks and high-performance 
vehicles. As a result, GM will be positioned to compete for nearly every 
customer type and preference in the market.

Ultium-based EVs will be powered by rectangular, pouch-style battery 
cells that are simple, lightweight and space-efficient. Our ability to 
stack the long pouch cells vertically or horizontally is unique in the 
industry and allows for a flat cabin floor and more interior room than

Climate-Related Opportunities 

Our top climate-related opportunities include: 

• Increased capital availability due to investor interest in 

decarbonization of the transportation sector [as a key ESG 
metric for our industry] and sustainability providing companies 
with a competitive advantage against peers.

• Shift in consumer preferences toward EVs creating new sales 

and new customer opportunities.

• Technological advances (e.g., battery and manufacturing 

efficiency) enabling resource and cost savings.

• Leadership in electrification and fuel cell innovation leading to 

new sales and new market opportunities.

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  27

Opportunity: Increased capital availability due to investor 
interest in decarbonization of the transportation sector 

Approach

In the capital markets, strong ESG performance could, in some cases, 
position GM shares to be included on certain securities indexes, as well 
as leading to more favorable debt pricing.

Our development of autonomous vehicles (AV) provides an example of 
increased capital availability due to investor interest and the potential 
for new revenue opportunities. Cruise, our global segment responsible 
for the development and commercialization of AV technology, has 
attracted funding from financial and strategic investors, including 
Honda, Microsoft and Walmart. This capital infusion, combined with our 
funding and collaboration, is enabling Cruise and GM to accelerate their 
efforts to commercialize self-driving vehicles. Learn more in the 
Advancing Transformative Technologies section.

In addition, AVs—particularly those that are passenger cars—could 
significantly affect the country’s ability to cut GHG emissions and move 
toward a carbon-free economy. Existing studies suggest that three 
main factors will determine whether putting more AVs on the road 
increases or decreases tailpipe carbon emissions: effect on the total 
vehicle-miles traveled in the United States; impacts on congestion; and 
AV fuel efficiency and fossil fuel consumption. As such, AVs must be 
assessed not only for their safety but also for their effect on carbon 
emissions levels.

Every Cruise AV test vehicle is also an EV that is derived from the 
Chevrolet Bolt EV. Introducing these technologies in tandem accomplishes 
multiple goals, including increasing acceptance of EVs and encouraging 
buildout of EV charging infrastructure.

Approach

Approach

In 2021, we accelerated our plan to transition to an all-electric  
future by announcing an increase in our EV and AV development 
investment target from $20 billion to $35 billion within the period  
of 2020 through 2025. 

We also announced plans to introduce more than 30 EVs globally 
by the end of 2025, with more than two-thirds of these available in 
North America. These introductions, along with additional EVs being 
planned, will enable EV sales to represent 40% to 50% of annual U.S. 
automotive sales volume by 2030, which is aligned with the current 
administration’s target of 50% electric vehicle sales share in 2030. To 
reach this upper range, we will continue to work with federal, state  
and local governments to implement supportive policies that will move 
the United States closer to meeting the carbon neutrality goals of the  
Paris Agreement.

In China, the world’s largest EV market, we will accelerate electrification 
through a plan in which 40% of new vehicles introduced through the end 
of 2025 will be EVs. This will build on our current market momentum  
in China.

Based on our planned cadence of EV introductions, GM will have more 
than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of  
2025. Additionally, GM will build up more than 1 million units in China 
over the same time frame. Our EV portfolio is planned to be among 
the broadest in the industry, with entries from affordable, high-volume 
market segments to top-of-the-line models and everything in between. 

Ultium represents a milestone achievement in electrification, with battery 
pack costs nearly 40% lower compared to the previous generation, and we 
expect the second generation Ultium packs will cost nearly 60% less than 
the batteries used today.1 We are committed to continuous improvement 
in manufacturing, materials and packaging efficiencies, high-energy cell 
design and increased vertical integration with local production that will 
deliver greater energy density at a lower cost.

Opportunity: Leadership in electrification and fuel cell 
innovation leading to new sales and market opportunities 

Our business growth model is predicated on leveraging leading 
positions in electrification, hydrogen fuel cell, autonomy and 
connected vehicles—positions that are transforming GM from 
automaker to platform innovator.  

The unique modularity and flexibility of the Ultium platform opens 
opportunities beyond our own vehicles. Ultium, together with our 
Hydrotec fuel cell platform, gives GM the potential to transform  
planes, trains, automobiles and boats into all-electric products.  
In 2021, GM made the following moves to extend zero emissions 
beyond automotive vehicles:

•  GM and Wabtec Corporation entered into a nonbinding 

memorandum of understanding to leverage our Ultium battery 
and HYDROTEC fuel cell technologies for Wabtec locomotives.

a)  Describe the 

organization’s 
processes for 
identifying and

related risks.

b)  Describe the 

organization’s 
processes for 
managing climate-
related risks. 

During 2021, we took steps to develop and refine our processes for 
identifying and evaluating climate-related risks. In collaboration with a 
third-party consultant, our corporate sustainability team convened and 
hosted a series of workshops with leaders from across key functions of 
the business, including public policy, GHG emissions experts, portfolio 
planning, strategic risk management, supply chain, legal and others.  
Through these workshops, we developed and validated an initial 
risk identification process as well as helped to ensure a strong and 
consistent understanding of the process for analyzing climate-related 
risks for TCFD purposes. 

Over the course of multiple days and sessions, we discussed dozens  
of potential risks and opportunities to determine those most applicable 
to our business, and then to qualitatively prioritize them. This 
identification and prioritization exercise was performed by business 
experts and leaders based on the experience and expertise of each. 
The results were further validated by sharing and discussing with the 
broader Office of Sustainability governance body, which includes 
senior leaders working on sustainability across the business.

Over the course of 2022, we will continue refining our risk 
identification process and assessing our exposure to these risks by 
partnering with a respected third party to employ their climate risk 
modeling platform. We will quantitatively evaluate both physical and 
transition risks under at least two to three different climate change 
scenarios. We will be paying careful attention to the sensitivity of 
the results to different assumptions and parameters. We also will be 
exploring how to further integrate the results from this assessment 
into strategic decision-making, as well as opportunities to internalize 
some of these processes and tools to enable us to efficiently conduct 
these assessments in the future.

Please see our CDP Climate Change 2021 response (C2.2, C2.2a, 
C2.3a) for more details.

GM approaches relevant climate-related risks on a risk-by-risk basis. 
The physical and transition risks identified earlier in this document  
are relevant to different parts of the business. For example, the risk  
of increased flooding and extreme weather events impacting the 
production, logistics and procurement of products from suppliers is 
managed by our GPSC organization. Securing consistent, resilient and 
sustainable supply chains for key materials is a strategic priority for 
GPSC. The organization maintains a “command center” that monitors 
real-time conditions and data from multiple sources to identify such 
events around the world and map them to our suppliers. In the event  
of an anticipated or actual disruption, alerts are quickly sent to  
the relevant teams internally, and contingency plans are created  
and implemented.

Raw material cost and supply variability are monitored closely 
by purchasing teams and senior leaders from multiple parts of 
the business. GM is prioritizing the development of a resilient and 
sustainable supply chain of raw materials to manufacture our battery 
chemistry, which requires cobalt, battery-grade nickel and lithium as 
well as other minerals. We are proactively and aggressively pursuing 
responsibly sourced materials at strategic tiers of the supply chain and 
exploring where investment and partnerships can yield benefits and 
untapped value that lowers costs of advanced technologies. Recently, 
we have advanced several initiatives in North America related to 
supplies of silicon carbide device solutions, rare earth minerals, lithium 
and cathode active material.

As part of our comprehensive climate change strategy, we identify and 
monitor climate-related risks on a regular basis across our business. 
The need for this constant process reflects the volatility of risk factors 
and dynamics that can quickly change scenarios. By institutionalizing 
climate change risks as part of our enterprise risk management 
function, we believe GM is better positioned to anticipate, detect and, 
ultimately, plan around these changes.

The Role of the Board and Senior Management

The Board has the overall responsibility for risk oversight, with a focus 
on the most significant risks facing the company, including climate 
change. While GM does not follow the precautionary approach, the 
company does have a comprehensive risk management plan in place. 
The Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and 
through delegation to Board Committees. Each of the Board Committees 
is responsible for oversight of risk management practices for categories 
of risks relevant to its functions, with the GCRC being responsible for 
risks related to the sustainability of our operations and products. 

The process and terminology in place for assessing relative significance 
of all identified risks, including climate-related risks such as increased 
and more stringent GHG emission regulations, is as follows: 

2021 SUSTAINABILITY SUPPLEMENT  31

•  Risks and opportunities are assessed based on probability of 

occurrence and impact to our financials, strategy and/or reputation.

•  All enterprise risks have approved mitigation plans and are 

reviewed regularly by the SLT and the Board. 

•  Each SLT member is involved in an annual risk assessment 

of their business unit to determine their top risks, which are 
actively managed and regularly reviewed with the business 
unit’s leadership team.

For additional detail on the critical role the Board’s Committees and 
senior management play in the execution of risk management, please 
see the Ensuring Responsible Governance section of this report.

Environmental Governance 

GM reduces operational risks through sound environmental 
management and by prioritizing compliance. We measure and manage 
natural resources used at all manufacturing locations, engineering 
centers, parts distribution centers and proving ground sites around  
the world. 

These facilities vary in function, geography, size and surrounding 
natural environments, which gives rise to varying concerns such as 
resource scarcity, different regulatory requirements and varying levels 
of environmental quality. These GM-owned and -operated facilities 
have location-specific operating plans that all function under GM’s 
global Environmental Policy.

In addition to GM’s Environmental Policy, which provides guidelines to 
help minimize the impact of our activities, products and services on the 
environment, GM manages climate-related risks through: 

•  Setting environmental commitments which encourage 

environmental consciousness in both daily conduct and in  
the planning of future products and programs. 

•  Implementing an environmental management system at all 
manufacturing facilities that GM owns and operates, and at  
a majority of our nonmanufacturing sites around the world. 

•  Complying with applicable environmental laws and  

regulations globally. 

•  Monitoring GM’s performance according to GM’s own 

Environmental Performance Criteria, which are universal 
corporate performance requirements designed to protect 
human health and the environment in accordance with the  
GM Environmental Policy.

•  Providing strategic training and guidance to our environmental 

professionals to help them keep pace with evolving 
environmental issues and best practices that could have 
application worldwide.

•  Publicly disclosing climate-related environmental performance 
through reporting frameworks such as GRI, SASB and CDP, in 
addition to TCFD. These reporting processes not only help us 
to manage and measure our progress, but also to engage with 
both internal and external stakeholders around the world.

Supply Chain Risks

GM is working diligently to further integrate environmental 
sustainability into all aspects of our supply chain functions. A cross-
enterprise GPSC Sustainability Team is supporting this effort through 
their focus on supply chain carbon footprint reduction—concentrating 
on Scope 3 emissions to include:

•  Emissions disclosure—Increasing visibility and supplier 

engagement in carbon footprint reduction through tracking  
of CDP engagement by select Tier I suppliers.

•  Sustainable logistics—Increasing shipping container packing 

density, route efficiency monitoring, supplier emissions 
reduction and alternative fuels.

In 2021, key activities included holding energy and water treasure 
hunts and virtual symposia for suppliers. Energy treasure hunts 
collectively provided recommendations to save 3,300 MWh of energy 
and 6,600 cubic meters of water and to eliminate 3,158 MT of CO2 
emissions. Also in 2021, GPSC increased participation among selected 
suppliers in its annual CDP Supply Chain Initiative to over 98% of 
surveyed suppliers. Learn more in Supporting Supplier Responsibility.

the entire organization on sustainability-related matters, including 
strategy. Leaders also ensure that sustainability is integrated into 
business functions and processes, often convening cross-functional 
experts to identify opportunities and solve challenges that can be 
implemented at the operational level.

To manage and measure progress over the next decade and beyond, 
the SO team will work toward a new comprehensive set of enterprise 
goals that includes:

•  Achieving carbon neutrality in global products and operations  

by 2040.

•  Eliminating tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles  

by 2035.

•  Sourcing 100% renewable electricity in the United States by 

2025 and globally by 2035.

•  Reducing operational energy intensity by 35% by 2030 against 

a 2010 baseline.

•  Enrolling 100% of our “targeted Tier I supplies” in GM’s Supplier 

Sustainability Program.

A key consideration in developing these enterprise-level goals has been 
to ensure all impacts of the business—both operational and product—are 
managed and measured to support our zero emissions future.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now 
and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries—developed and developing—in a global partnership. 
Below you can find how GM has mapped their most material topics and strategic priorities to targets within these 17 goals.

  1.  Water data, other than municipal and well water, is collected from global facilities.
 2.  Engineering estimate from site water balance for evaporation in Assembly plants = 30%. Using standard calculation: Withdrawal—Discharge is inaccurate due to ground water infiltration at plant discharge.
 3.   GM measures and monitors 100% of our major facilities’ water withdrawals by source using either invoices or meter data on a monthly basis. It is tracked in a global utility database by source, and the data is verified by an independent third party annually. Some small facilities 
(offices) have water service included in their lease rate, and we do not track the water withdrawal. Our estimate is that this represents less than 1% of our water withdrawal by source, so we measure and monitor 99% of water withdrawal by source. Intensity is calculated by 
withdrawal/vehicle production (M-Schedule where we monitor water use).

 Number of lost workday cases due to injuries and illnesses per 1,000,000 work hours. 

  1. 
  2.  This KPI focuses on those injuries and illnesses that resulted in employees and contractors losing days from work. This helps us identify areas and processes where we should center our focus to improve our safety controls.
  3.  Reported value has been updated from the value published in GM 2020 Sustainability Report due to a transposing error.
  4.  A work-related incident resulting in death. Our target is zero, so that every person who enters a GM facility leaves safe and unharmed.
  5.  Number of incidents that resulted in injuries or illnesses that required medical treatment beyond simple first aid treatment per 1,000,000 work hours. 
  6.  This metric helps to identify hazards, eliminate risks and drive reporting for all incidents so that we can identify and assess areas for improvement.
  7.  Reported value has been updated from the value published in GM 2020 Sustainability Report.

GRI Index       SASB Response       TCFD Response       UN SDGs       UNGC       Data Center       Assurance Statements

Statement of Verification 

Introduction 
Stantec  Consulting  Ltd.  (Stantec)  was  contracted  by  General  Motors  Company  (GM)  to  conduct  an  independent  third-party  verification  of  a 
selection of greenhouse gas (GHG) and sustainability data assertions (the Assertions) for their Global Facilities.  

In this work, GM was responsible for the collection of activity data used in the calculations, data management, completion of the calculations, and 
preparation of the report that contains the Assertions. 

Stantec was responsible for planning and executing the verification to deliver a limited level of assurance opinion as to whether the Assertions 
are presented fairly and in accordance with the verification criteria. Stantec is accredited with the ANSI National Accreditation Board (ANAB), a 
member of the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), in accordance with ISO 14065 (Accreditation ID #0805 issued to Stantec Consulting Ltd. 
for GHG verification and validation).  

Intended User 
The results of the verification will be used by GM for internal and external sustainability reporting, and for reporting to CDP. The users of this 
statement are GM, shareholders and the public. 

Verification Objective 
The objective of the verification was to assess whether the  GHG and sustainability data  assertions (as presented  in Table 1) for GM’s 2021 
operations are accurately prepared in accordance with appropriate criteria.  

Verification Boundaries 
The boundaries of the verification include GM owned and operated facilities within General Motors North America (GMNA), General Motors South 
America (GMSA) and General Motors International Operations (GMIO).  A subset of GM facilities has been excluded from the Assertions, and a 
list of these excluded facilities has been provided to Stantec and included in the detailed verification report for transparency. 

Reporting Period 
The verification was conducted for the period of January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021.
