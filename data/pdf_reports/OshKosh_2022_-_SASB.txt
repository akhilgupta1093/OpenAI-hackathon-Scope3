Fuel Economy & Emissions in 
Use-Phase

RT-IG-410a. 1

Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for 
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles

Gallons per 1,000 ton-miles

27.8

In 2021 the EPA changed the GEM 
model used to calculate fuel 
economy and emissions. The 
change in the calculation from the 
EPA changed the value this year. The 
distribution and characteristics of 
the trucks in scope were essentially 
the same as last year. 

Note: The data shared reflects 
trucks Oshkosh builds from the 
frame up (S-Series, P-Series, and all
Pierce fire trucks). Defense vehicles 
are built under the national security 
exemption and no data is included. 
Commercial vehicles built from 
chassis built by other companies 
are not included.

RT-IG-410a. 3

Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for 
stationary generators

Watts per gallon

N/A

RT-IG-410a. 2

Sales-weighted fuel efficiency for 
non-road equipment

Gallons per hour

RT-IG-410a. 4

Sales-weighted emissions of: (1) nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and (2) particulate matter 
(PM) for: (a) marine diesel engines, (b) 
locomotive diesel engines, (c) non-road 
medium- and heavy-duty engines and (d) 
other non-road diesel engines

Grams per kilowatt-hour

Due to the diversity of applications 
of our non-road products, we do not 
calculate sales-weighted fuel
efficiency for non-road equipment. 
Nor do we calculate NOx and PM 
emissions on a sales-weighted 
basis. We continue to expand our 
offering of hybrid and electric
vehicles. For more information on 
sustainable products, see pages 
23-24 of the 2021 Sustainability 
Report.

Description of the 
management of risks 
associated with the use 
of critical materials

Oshkosh Corporation manufactures products that depend on critical 
materials to ensure the performance, durability and longevity of our 
vehicles. In cooperation with our global supply chain partners, we strive 
to manage the business, social and environmental risks associated with 
procuring critical materials. We utilize different tools and strategies to be 
socially responsible and understand the reputation of Oshkosh Corporation 
and its products may be impacted by the supply, price, and regulation of 
these materials, including conflict minerals.

Oshkosh Corporation’s global supply chain partners are vetted through a 
series of controls to better understand how our partners determine and 
ensure traceability of content throughout the product life cycle; some of
these controls include quality audits and operational assessments. In 
addition, Oshkosh Corporation mitigates risk in the global supply chain 
through the use of our Supplier Code of Ethics and Conduct, Supplier 
Standards Guide and Country of Origin processes found within our Terms 
and Conditions.

Oshkosh Corporation’s Supplier Code of Ethics and Conduct requires Tier 1 
suppliers to adhere to the following policies regarding conflict minerals:
•  Make reasonable inquiries about the country of origin of products, 

containing 3TG materials, delivered to any Oshkosh Corporation facility, 
whether sourced directly or through a sub-supplier.
Conduct due diligence to verify 3TG materials were sourced from a 
conflict-free source.
Disclose evidence of due diligence to Oshkosh Corporation.

• 

• 

We have set a goal to require 100% of our global supply chain, directly or 
through sub-suppliers, to comply with the Oshkosh Supplier Code of Ethics 
and Conduct, Supplier Standards Guide and our Terms and Conditions.

Critical material will always be available; however, it may experience price
volatility depending on supply and demand. Oshkosh Corporation’s 
purchasing strategy is to recognize changes in market behavior and 
consider buying strategic inventories, lead time reduction and long term 
agreements. Oshkosh Corporation works hard to source product and
materials ethically and utilizes controls to partner with our global supply 
chain to identify and control the use of critical materials.
