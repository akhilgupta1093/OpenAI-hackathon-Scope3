Letter from the Chairman and CEO

Juan R. Luciano 
C H A I R M A N   A N D   C E O

Dear Stakeholders:

At ADM, we know that the health of our 
natural resources is critical to our future, 
and that our commitments to sustainable 
practices will result in a stronger ADM 
and a better world. We are proud to be 
the go-to sustainable sourcing partner 
for our customers, and more widely, 
we are committed to driving change 
through good practices, progressive 
solutions and mindful actions that make a 
positive impact.

The importance of these commitments 
becomes even more clear amid an 
unprecedented challenge such as the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Companies like ADM 
are playing a critical role in supporting and 
maintaining the global food chain. And while 
we are focused on operating safely and 
effectively today, we cannot lose sight of 
tomorrow. Even amid these global challenges, 
we are continuing our work to ensure that 
ADM and the natural resources on which we 
depend remain strong and vital in the years 
to come.

Our leadership position in the agriculture 
and food value chain gives us a tremendous 
opportunity to help build a more sustainable 
food system. Our primary sustainability focus 
areas remain No-Deforestation, Human Rights, 
Sustainable Agriculture, and Responsible 
Operations. These focus areas are aligned with 

the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals – Climate Action, Life on Land, Clean 
Water and Sanitation, Zero Hunger, and Decent 
Work and Economic Growth – and we believe 
that concentrating on them gives us the best 
opportunity to positively impact our planet 
and the people and communities we serve, as 
well as supporting long-term value creation for 
our company.

There are many ways in which we are living our 
values, and one of the most important is our 
work to reduce the environmental footprint 
of our own operations. We met our previous 
goals ahead of schedule, and this year, we 
were proud to make even more ambitious 
commitments: to reduce our absolute 
greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent, our 
energy intensity by 15 percent, our water 
intensity by 10 percent and achieve a 90 
percent landfill diversion rate, all by 2035.

I’m proud that our sustainable business 
practices continue to be recognized by 
outside organizations. Once again, ADM was 
named an Industry Mover in the RobecoSAM 
Sustainability Yearbook 2019. We were also 
shortlisted as a Sustainability Champion by the 
Food Ingredients Innovation awards for our 
work in promoting and supporting sustainable 
agricultural practices among more than 12,000 
smallholder farmers in Brazil and Paraguay.

Sustainability.  
It’s in our nature.

ADM has also been recognized more broadly 
for its commitment to ethics and being a good 
corporate citizen. In February 2020, we were 
recognized by Ethisphere, a global leader in 
defining and advancing the standards of ethical 
business practices, as one of the World’s 
Most Ethical Companies. We are also proud 
to be included on the annual Forbes Best 
Employers List.

Every day, we are advancing our values and 
executing on our commitments. This report lays 
out our priorities, highlights the great progress 
our team is making, and tells just a few of the 
stories of the lives that we have positively 
impacted around the globe. The world today 
faces many challenges we could not have 
foreseen a year ago, and yet facing those new 
challenges does not mean we are stepping back 
from the commitments we have made. Never 
before has our purpose, unlocking the power 
of nature to enrich the quality of life, been 
more important, and never before have I been 
prouder of our efforts to live up to that purpose.

Materiality Assessment and Stakeholder Engagement

Materiality is key to sustainability reporting. 
With so many topics that could be covered, 
conducting a materiality assessment allows 
us to focus our reporting on topics that 
reflect the economic, environmental and 
social impacts that are the most significant 
to our strategy and business operations and 
important to our stakeholders.

In 2017, ADM engaged Deloitte Advisory to 
undertake a formal materiality assessment 
to help inform our Corporate Sustainability 
Report. We asked Deloitte to apply its 
knowledge of the GRI methodology 
and our industry to select stakeholders 
for engagement.

Working with ADM, Deloitte included and 
surveyed a variety of internal and external 
stakeholders and conducted secondary 
research that included a review of documents 
published by a variety of parties. To select 
the list of stakeholders to include in the 
materiality assessment, ADM and Deloitte 
applied GRI’s stakeholder selection criteria 
of responsibility, influence, proximity, 
dependency, and representation.

The following stakeholder groups were 
included as part of the assessment:

 • ADM leadership – interviews
 • Investors – interviews
 • Analysts – secondary research
 • Customers – interviews and 

secondary research

 • Employees – survey
 • Trade associations – interviews and 

secondary research

 • Regulators – secondary research
 • Civil society/non-governmental 

organizations (NGOs) – interviews

The process revealed that several key topics 
were consistent across all stakeholder groups, 
with deforestation, human rights, and our 
environmental footprint criteria among the 
primary concerns raised.

Ongoing and Continuous 
Stakeholder Engagement

We intend to conduct another formal 
materiality assessment at the end of 2020 to 
ensure that we maintain a comprehensive 
and long-term focus on our sustainability 
efforts. In the meantime, we have ongoing 
stakeholder engagement via customer 
feedback, NGO inquiries, and dialogue 
with shareholders. In addition, we meet 
regularly with several customers with whom 
we have entered into partnerships on 
sustainable agriculture and environmental 
topics. Any interested party can also reach 
out to us at sustainability@adm.com. 
All of these touchpoints help direct our 
sustainability programs.

Goals, Targets and KPIs

The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) as a universal call to action to end 
poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace 
and prosperity. The 17 SDGs provide clear guidelines and targets 
for countries and governments, although industry still has a vital 
role to help achieve these goals. At ADM, we have undertaken a 
mapping exercise to determine which SDGs align with our business 
objectives and in turn allow us to make the greatest contribution 
toward achievement. Specifically, we are focusing our efforts toward 
Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic 
Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land.

Below are highlights of some of our activities that support our 
commitment to these SDGs, as well as some of our other company goals.

“15x20” Environmental Goals

Responsible Sourcing

ADM procures agricultural commodities 
around the world, and our vast supply 
chain has a direct impact on the land 
use and biodiversity of those regions, 
as well as the lives of individuals 
living and working there. Some of our 
sourcing regions are at a particular 
risk for deforestation and human 
rights violations. Our policies and 
commitments related to these issues 
apply to our entire supply chain with 
implementation activities focusing first 
on high-risk geographies.

In addition, we leverage our experience 
in responsible sourcing practices to 
enhance local communities’ access to 
clean water and sanitation (as part of 
our commitment to human rights) and 
sustainable agriculture practices.

No-Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation 
(No DPE)

We believe in paving the way through good 
practices, progressive solutions and mindful 
actions that make a positive impact. For 
the past five years, ADM has been working 
diligently to implement our No-Deforestation 
program. The clearing of forested, High 
Carbon Stock (HCS) and High Conservation 
Value (HCV) areas for planting threatens 
biodiversity, soil health, and vital carbon 
sinks as well as indigenous communities 
who rely on those areas for their livelihood. 
ADM aims to leverage the company’s role as 
a major buyer of crops to help create more 
sustainable, traceable supply chains to protect 
these valuable natural resources.

Using a risk-based approach, ADM has focused 
initially on its palm and South American soy 
supply chains. Our efforts are organized into 
four categories: transparency and traceability, 
supplier engagement and risk identification; 
transformation; and monitoring and verification. 
Progress reports are published regularly on our 
Sustainability Progress Tracker which also hosts 
our public grievance mechanism.

Palm
Supply chain traceability provides insight that 
enables us to improve our palm oil sourcing. 
Knowing where our palm originates allows 
us to avoid purchasing from groups that 
do not share our values and commitments. 
As we continue to maintain a high level of 
traceability to the palm oil mill, we have also 
embarked on a journey with our suppliers to 
trace the origins of the palm to the plantation 
level. This endeavor is a process, requiring 
collaboration along the entire supply chain.

The traceability scores allow us to identify 
important sourcing areas in which there 
may be need for social and environmental 
interventions to support policy compliance. 
Prioritizing transformation initiatives in 
this manner allows us to engage where we 
have the greatest leverage and supplier 
collaboration.

ADM also implements monitoring and 
verification procedures. We maintain a 
Grievance and Resolutions procedure and log, 
both of which are available on our website. 
Because we do not own palm plantations or 
source directly from them, we collaborate 
with our suppliers and other stakeholders to 
monitor our supply chain and to investigate 
allegations of violations. In 2018, ADM began 
implementation of the Engagement for 
Policy Implementation (EPI) survey with its 
suppliers. The EPI survey is a tool provided 
by Earthworm Foundation (EF) that allows 
an understanding of each supplier’s progress 
related to all aspects of an No DPE-compliant 
responsible sourcing program. All but one 
supplier agreed to participate, and in 2019, 
the process was implemented providing 
valuable insight into our supply chain.

 • 100% of suppliers have a responsible 

sourcing policy 

 • 99% of suppliers publicly report progress 

on No DPE implementation 
 • 99% of suppliers have grievance 

mechanisms in place 

 • 94% of suppliers monitor for deforestation 

and exploitation

Monitoring and verification efforts are 
critical to the success of our No DPE policy 
implementation. Through the EPI survey, ADM 
found that 92% of our palm oil volume comes 
from direct suppliers who score an average 
of 76% on the monitoring and verification 
section of the survey.

Palm Transformation Projects

The Sabah region of Malaysia was previously 
identified as a strategic area of interest for 
ADM, and in 2019, our efforts continued 
there. In partnership with EF, we have 
remained focused on projects related to 
education and collaboration in order to 
protect vulnerable children in the region and 
improve the livelihoods of smallholders in our 
supply chain. 

 • Diversification of Smallholder Income in 
Sabah, Malaysia (Rurality): The Rurality 
project is working with two palm mills, 
engaging 46 smallholders with a total 
impact on 270 people. Through education 
and engagement, smallholders develop 
and enhance skills to diversify their income 
opportunities which in turn, improves 
their livelihoods.

 • Children in Plantations project in Sabah, 

Malaysia: Six mills in ADM’s supply 
chain are participating. In 2019, EF, 
in collaboration with ADM and other 
corporations has developed a directory 
of social help businesses to improve 

the welfare of children living in or near 
plantations. The Children in Plantation (CiP) 
Directory is the first publication of its kind 
in Malaysia – one of EF’s efforts to improve 
education, health and safety on-site and 
to encourage businesses and palm oil 
suppliers to engage with NGOs and other 
stakeholders.

In 2019, ADM also partnered with EF on 
projects in Guatemala (focus on protection 
of human rights in the palm oil sector) 
and Indonesia (deforestation, sustainable 
agriculture and income diversification).

In Brazil, ADM partnered with the 
Brazilian Society for Wildlife Research and 
Environmental Education (SPVS) on a project 
to promote sustainable farming practices and 
biodiversity conservation. Focusing mainly 
on smallholder farms, the project drew on 
traditional agricultural knowledge and modern 
biodiversity initiatives to provide guidance 
on improving sustainability management, 
resistance to climate change and overall 
crop yields. ADM trained approximately 300 
smallholders located in the municipalities 
of São Domingos do Capim, Mãe de Rio and 
Irituia, located in the Northeastern state of 
Pará, which encompass highly biodiverse 
forests and rivers: ecosystems that are vital 
to the conservation of biodiversity in the 
Amazon, as well as the socio-economic 
development of the local area.

Soy

Similar to our palm implementation efforts, 
our efforts in the soy supply chain in South 
America focus on traceability, engagement 
and transformation, and monitoring 
and verification. 

In addition to maintaining a high level of 
traceability to the farm of origin (99% of 
direct suppliers), ADM began efforts to obtain 
digital satellite farm maps (polygons) of our 
soybean suppliers in select municipalities. 
The Brazilian states of MAranhão, TOcantins, 
PIauí and BAhia, or MATOPIBA, make up a 
region in the Cerrado with an historically 
higher risk of native forest conversion for soy 
expansion. First phase priority municipalities 
within MATOPIBA were based on several 
key indicators: rate of conversion of native 
vegetation, area of native vegetation 
cover, area of soy cultivation, and ADM 
procurement. Statistical and geospatial 
analysis were used to identify key geographic 
clusters. We are able to use the polygons to 
proactively track and understand the origin of 
soy, as well as investigate any grievances or 
complaints within our soy supply chain, which 
we then post to our grievance log.

In 2019, ADM continued traceability efforts 
by adding polygons to our database. Today we 
have approximately 70% of our suppliers in 
Paraguay mapped. We also kept adding new 
suppliers that have joined our supply chain and 
obtained polygons for 95% of our suppliers in 
25 priority municipalities in MATOPIBA and 
95% of our suppliers in Mato Grosso.

The soy supply chain and multitude of 
biomes in Brazil require collaboration among 
all stakeholders to successfully protect the 
area. ADM is an active member of Grupo 
de Trabalho da Soja (Soy Working Group), 
a group of NGOs and industry companies, 
most notable for developing the Amazon Soy 
Moratorium. We are also a member of the 
spinoff group Grupo de Trabalho do Cerrado 
(Cerrado Working Group), which is working 
to address deforestation in the Cerrado 
Biome. And, we participate in the MATOPIBA 
Coalition, an initiative supported by the 
United Nations Development Programme 
(UNDP) Global Environmental Finance 
(GEP), which brings together different actors 
willing to find sustainable balance between 
agricultural production and conservation.

ADM is also member of the Soft Commodities 
Forum of the World Business Council for 
Sustainable Development along with other 
industry/trading companies who share the 
same goals regarding No-Deforestation 
and No-Exploitation in the supply chains. 
The forum is working to define common 
standards that will bring more transparency 
to the sector as a whole and searching for 
financial incentives that will protect forested 
areas and/or promote the use of previously 
cleared land.

SOY TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT
Aliança da Terra

Since 2009, ADM has supported Aliança da Terra, an 
agricultural-improvement program based in Latin America. It 
focuses on helping soybean producers in Brazil and Paraguay 
implement sustainable farming practices that protect the 
environment and improve yields. This can help reduce the 
pressure to expand into ecologically sensitive areas. ADM is 
a founding sponsor of the program, and over the past ten 
years, we have seen the fruits of our efforts, as the program 

has been implemented on nearly 450 properties covering over 
1,400,000 hectares. In 2019, we focused on 20 rural properties 
totaling 45,000 hectares.

When a farmer opts in to the program, a technical advisor 
visits the farm to assess current conditions including best 
management practices and legal compliance in the areas of 
labor, safety practices and environmental protection. The 
assessment highlights improvement opportunities for the 

grower, without fear of negative repercussions. The technical 
advisor creates a socio-environmental diagnosis and action 
plan. In the final aspect of the program, the grower commits to 
implement agreed actions and to monitor annual progress.

Technical assistance, information and transparency drive 
transformation through continuous improvement over time. 
This personalized approach and field-level success has earned 
the trust and support of local growers.

Human Rights
We believe that although governments have 
the primary duty to protect and ensure 
fulfillment of human rights, ADM plays a role 
in protecting human rights and can act as a 
force for change in the communities in which 
we operate.

ADM has a direct impact on numerous 
communities around the globe through our 
sourcing practices, and we focus on mitigating 
threats in areas at higher risk for human rights 
violations. Using the United Nations Human 
Development Index (HDI) and third-party 
risk assessments, we have prioritized those 
higher-risk geographies and commodities 
within our global reach. 

Agricultural production, particularly in 
countries with lower HDI values, has a 
higher risk of using slave and child labor, not 
paying living wages, having unsafe working 
conditions and violating additional rights. 
These practices threaten the development 
and livelihood of local communities. To 
address these risks, ADM has established a 
Human Rights Policy, with which we require 
all colleagues and suppliers to comply.

Risk Assessment and Audits

For the past two years, ADM has worked with 
ELEVATE to support its Human Rights Action 
Plan to conduct a supply chain risk analysis. 
ELEVATE initially took a two-phased approach 
to segment ADM’s complex and expansive 
supply chain to gain deeper insight into 
inherent risks and challenges with sourcing 

based on country and commodity. In the third 
phase, the analytical scope was expanded 
to include the vanilla bean supply chain 
after acquisition of Rodelle. This partnership 
supported our ability to prioritize resources 
based on risk and leverage. The results of the 
analysis allowed us to refine our responsible 
sourcing program and utilize new tools to 
direct investment where ADM can have the 
biggest impact for risk management and 
supplier improvement. 

In 2019, ADM expanded its Sedex membership 
to enable not only assessment of our own 
operations, but the ability to request and 
review assessments of our suppliers. This 
additional insight allows us to screen for 
potential human rights risks at key supplier 
facilities. We also continued with Sedex 
audits of our facilities. We hosted audits at 
13 locations spanning the United States, 
United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, and 
Turkey. At the facilities visited, there were no 
fees charged to job-seekers in exchange for 
employment, and no collateral was taken in 
the form of money, identification or other 
personal belongings without workers’ consent 
as a condition of employment by ADM or 
contracted companies. No human trafficking 
was observed. All findings were considered 
to be minor and low risk. ADM sustainability, 
law, operations, and compliance teams work 
with the locations to identify and implement 
corrective actions.

TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

SAVAN Vanilla

Almost 80% of the world’s vanilla is sourced 
from Madagascar, where it’s produced and 
collected from villages in a complex supply 
chain. Through SAVAN, our joint venture 
partnership with Sahanala, we are the 
industry’s first farmer-owned processor 
and exporter of vanilla beans, rooting our 
supply chain at the origin source. Sahanala 
is a farmer-owned cooperative that has 
more than 3,600 vanilla farmers across 19 
associations in Madagascar. The vertical 
supply chain eliminates unnecessary steps 
and stress from the vanilla typical supply 

chain, ensuring that farmers are directly 
engaged in the entire business model. 
Simplifying the collection ensures farmers 
receive more of the profits sales.

Our partnership with Sahanala doesn’t begin 
and end with a sale. We also work together to 
implement industry-changing, farmer-focused 
social programs. ADM works with Sahanala to 
implement programs for reliable education, 
medical care and food security that help uplift 
the quality of life in a sustainable way for 
vanilla farmers. SAVAN bolsters an extension 
worker program that provides agronomy 

support and promotes farming best practices 
to help increase crop yields, improve vanillin 
content, and establish a more stable industry. 
Each farmer association chooses how to 
allocate profits generated through the joint 
venture operations in ways that make the 
most immediate positive impact on their 
communities including community health 
offices, schools, and churches. To ensure 
food security, ADM Cares approved $70,000 
to provide rice for Sahanala farmers in the 
off-season covering 17,000 people including 
4,410 farmers and their families.

Meet Rasoanalaina Lydia.
In 1998, Lydia formed the Zoto 
association and has over 20 years of 
experience working with vanilla. She 
brought together all the producers 
from the Farahalana rural municipality 
in a single association to ensure that 
all the producers were well supervised 
and had enough income to feed their 
families. The Zoto association joined 
Sahanala in 2015 and has seen a 
steady improvement in the standard 
of living for their members. Lydia’s 
focus on transparency and individual 
ownership of the link between 
SAVAN and producers has led to 
her re-election as the lead of the 
association by its 350 members. Over 
the next 10 years, Lydia hopes to build 
a high school and vocational training 
center for her village to promote 
education and more youth initiatives.

Clean Water and Sanitation

India

Through an ADM Cares grant in 2019, 
Water.org will provide access to clean drinking 
water for 800 households: 500 rural families 
in Maharashtra and 300 rural families in 
Karnataka. The grant helps rural households 
secure a water connection from the 
community water source to their homes and 
provides domestic purifier units, bringing safe 
drinking water to the whole family.

ADM believes that access to clean water 
is a basic human right – clean water is an 
essential resource that impacts the health, 
livelihood and food security of communities 
around the world. Unfortunately, the 
integrity of our global water supply faces 
numerous threats, including pollution, poor 
infrastructure, and devastating droughts. At 
ADM, we want to make sure our employees 
and the communities in which we operate 
have access to clean water. To demonstrate 
the importance of this commitment, 
the company’s Human Rights Policy 
includes access to water and sanitation as 
protected rights.

ADM financially supports several projects 
aimed at providing basic water and sanitation 
needs in communities where we operate.

Peru

Last year, we highlighted our efforts to bring 
fresh drinking water and sanitation facilities to 
schools in the villages in the Peruvian jungle 
that harvest Huito, a unique super-fruit. In 
2019, ADM Cares provided another grant to 
Care Peru to continue those efforts. To date, 
six schools, serving 925 students have been 
impacted, with plans to provide resources to 
three additional schools.

Field to Market

The Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture is 
a collaborative supply chain effort focused 
on driving continuous improvement in 
agricultural practices and systems across 
the U.S. In collaboration with Field to 
Market, partners along the supply chain 
come together to develop and implement 
continuous improvement projects which drive 
positive impact and sustainable outcomes in 
their supply chains. Field to Market’s flexible 
approach allows partners to identify key areas 
of strategic importance for their businesses 
and goals and tailor projects that focus and 
catalyze change in those areas. At ADM, we 
believe water quality and soil health are of 
strategic importance for our business and 
for the current and future livelihoods of our 
suppliers and the surrounding communities. 
We focus on supporting farmers in adopting 
practices that address water quality and 
soil health, such as cover crops, reduced 
tillage, complex crop rotations, and nutrient 
management to reduce soil erosion, nutrient 
run-off, and GHG emissions. Farmers benefit 
from these conservation practices by keeping 
their most valuable asset—their soil—and 
expensive inputs like nitrogen on the field 
instead of in the local waterways. ADM is an 
active member of Field to Market with nine 
projects covering 735,000 acres. Our projects 
span corn, soy and wheat and have different 
objectives based on the crop and geography. 
For example, one soybean project in Iowa 
focuses on cover crops to improve water 
quality, while a wheat project in Kansas and 
Nebraska focuses on farmer education and 

outreach to build soil health. To increase 
the impact of our Field to Market projects, 
we support two initiatives in tandem with 
growers in some projects.

Saving Tomorrow’s Agricultural 
Resources (STAR) Program – Started in 
Champaign County, Illinois, the STAR program 
evaluation system assigns points for each 
cropping, tillage, nutrient application and 
soil conservation activity used on individual

values assigned are determined by a group 
of scientists and researchers, including some 
farmers who are involved in research. Each 
participant receives a rating from 1-5 stars 
and a feedback report containing suggested 
practices to achieve the next star level.

AgWater Challenge – Started in 2016 
by Ceres and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 
the AgWater Challenge encourages better 
water stewardship among the world’s most 
influential food and beverage companies. 
ADM joined in 2018 with measurable

processing volume from FtM projects 
by 2022.

 • Supporting The Nature Conservancy’s goal 
of enrolling at least 50 farmers for crop 
year 2018, with 50% of acres rated at least 
3 stars and 25% rated at 5 stars by 2028.
 • Donating $30,000 to local Soil and Water 

Conservation Districts for farmer education 
and outreach or financial support to help 
farmers transition to more sustainable 
farming practices.

Compliance and Ethics

At ADM, we believe in making a 
positive impact.

In February 2020, ADM was recognized 
by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining 
and advancing the standards of ethical 
business practices as one of the World’s 
Most Ethical Companies. This award 
demonstrates ADM’s commitment, across 
the whole organization, top to bottom 
and across all lines of businesses and 
regions, to doing business with integrity 
and abiding by strong ethical values.

At ADM, we act through a set of fundamental 
behaviors that set us apart from others. We 
are always advancing - learning, researching 
and developing, with a focus on solutions. We 
are bold, resourceful, and committed – taking 
on some of the world’s toughest challenges 
and applying our resources, expertise and 
work ethic to get things done. And our strong 
compliance and ethics program supports ADM 
in achieving the right results, the right way.

We have a robust, global Anti-Corruption 
program that, together with our Code 
of Conduct establishes high standards of 
honesty and integrity for all ADM colleagues 
and business partners. The Code and 
related compliance policies set forth specific 
principles and guidelines to help ensure that 
our company conducts business fairly and 
ethically at all times, everywhere we operate. 
The Code also offers guidance, supported by 
our global Conflict of Interest program, on the 
appropriate handling of situations in which 
personal and business interests have the 
potential to conflict. The company maintains 
the ADM Way Helpline as a resource to ask 
questions, seek guidance, or report suspected 
misconduct without fear of retaliation – 
anonymously if desired, where permitted 
by law.

Our Environmental Footprint

Sustainability matters – to our customers, to 
consumers and to us a company. We know 
that sustainability is a continuous journey, 
and we are committed to making continuous 
progress to reduce our global greenhouse 
gas emissions and energy consumption. As a 
global enterprise, climate change is an issue 
that has implications for our employees, 
our stakeholders, the communities in which 
we operate, and all aspects of our business. 
ADM has a large industrial footprint and we 
believe we have a responsibility to lower 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related 
to our business activities. What’s more, 
the agricultural supply chain – with which 
ADM is closely associated – contains a 
variety of GHG emissions sources, as well as 
potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
sequestration capabilities.

ADM also uses natural resources in 
manufacturing, storage and distribution, 
including electricity, water, fuel and raw 
materials. We also generate waste and have 
chemical storage onsite at many of our 
facilities, which have the potential to impact 
land, water and air.

In 2017, ADM met its “15x20” goals for 
GHG emissions, energy, water and waste. 
Earlier this year, we announced a new series 
of ambitious goals. As a company, we are 
committed to meeting our environmental 
obligations, while pursuing ways to 
continually improve our efforts in both 
protecting the environment and enhancing 
environmental sustainability.

GHG Emissions

In 2019, our emissions intensity reduction 
over our 2010 baseline was 15%. ADM 
continued operation of its CCS project, 
successfully injecting and sequestering 
521,000 metric tons of CO2, bringing the total 
sequestered to over 2.5 million metric tons.

In 2019, ADM convened a Carbon Reduction 
Task Force that worked to identify reduction 
opportunities throughout our operations. 
During the fourth quarter, ADM hired WSP 
to review our efforts and conduct a carbon 
reduction feasibility study here.

Based upon its analysis of the feasibility study, 
ADM has set an ambitious goal to reduce 
its absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
by 25% from its 2019 baseline by 2035. This 
would represent an average annual reduction 
of 1.67% for 15 years. This is more aggressive 
than the absolute emissions contraction 
approach that takes into account the global 
carbon budget, which requires an annual 
reduction of 1.23% to limit global warming 
to two degrees Celsius. ADM will achieve this 
new goal by purchasing renewable electricity, 
increasing the use of biomass fuels, and 
modifying our transportation fleet and 
equipment in some locations.

Enabling GHG Emissions Reductions 
in Our Supply Chain
In addition to our efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions within our operations, we have 
several initiatives to help reduce emissions in 
our supply chain.

Energy
Although we have already met our energy 
reduction goal, we continue to move forward. 
We announced our new goal to reduce energy 
intensity 15% by 2035 over a 2019 baseline. 
We also implemented a number of energy 
efficiency projects globally in 2019, several 
of which were behavioral changes identified 
through our Energy Treasure Hunt program. 
Many of these involved simple changes in 
control strategies or operating procedures 
which have resulted in energy reduction 
without significant capital costs. We have also 
instituted enhanced performance management 
in our large U.S. cogeneration facilities where 
additional KPIs have been instituted along with 
formal, regular review sessions with leadership 
aimed at assessing operational performance 
and identifying improvements which resulted 
in significant reductions and operational cost 
savings in 2019. Examples include:

 • Boiler automation upgrade in Latur, India – 

4,400 MWh energy savings

 • Refinery heat exchanger project in Quincy, 
Illinois, USA – 14,600 MWh energy savings

 • Wood chip feeder upgrade in Maracaju, 

Brazil – 1,900 MWh energy savings

 • Cooling tower optimization in Cedar Rapids, 
Iowa, USA – 8,200 MWh energy savings

Water

Water reduction efforts are focused on our 
38 largest sites, which collectively account 
for more than 96 percent of our global water 
usage. In 2019, our water use intensity 
reduction over our 2008 baseline was 23%.

After achieving our water intensity reduction 
target early, ADM has shifted focus toward 
the future. In 2019, we updated our water 
risk assessment using updated data available 
through the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) Aqueduct Tool. Based on our new 
assessment, we have set two water goals.

In our operations, we will reduce our water 
intensity by 10% over our 2019 baseline 
by 2035. In addition, to support the health 
and wellbeing of the communities where 
we operate, by 2025, we will develop a 
global improvement strategy in priority 
watersheds. This approach will allow us to 
implement projects where they will be the 
most impactful.

Waste

ADM achieved its 15x20 waste target through 
global efforts to increase recycling and find 
alternative uses for waste—such as sending 
unusable grain to be turned into fuel or 
fertilizer. Challenging conditions around the 
world have limited our ability to beneficially 
reuse some waste streams, and recent 
mergers and acquisitions have affected our 
indicators resulting in an annual waste to 
landfill rate of 19%.

Looking forward, ADM has set a new waste 
goal where at least 90% of waste generated 
will be beneficially reused, recycled, or 
otherwise diverted from landfill by 2035. 
Below are a few of the innovative projects we 
have undertaken to improve recycling in our 
operations and in our supply chain.

Recycling Used Cooking Oil

Improper disposal of used cooking oil poses 
a risk to the environment. In addition, the 
oil has value when recycled and reused as 
a feedstock for soaps, detergents, and even 
biodiesel. That’s why in 2018, ADM began 
a program to reclaim used cooking oil. The 
“Programa Meio Ambiente nas Escolas”, 
through its Concórdia oil brand, provides 
centralized collection points in the city of 
Carapicuíba in São Paulo. The program 
focuses on environmental education work 
in schools, mobilizing municipal education 
networks to raise awareness among students, 
families and communities for the correct 
disposal of used cooking oil, making schools 
a voluntary delivery place for used oil. The 
project encourages students to store used oil 
in their homes, in bottles, and then take it to 
the voluntary delivery place in their schools.

ADM has set a new waste  
goal where at least

90%

of waste generated will be 
beneficially reused, recycled, 
or otherwise diverted from 
landfill by 2035

Preserva Ambiental coordinates the oil 
collection in the schools, and markets it to 
approved buyers. The group then gives the 
income generated from the sale of the oil 
to the Parent Teacher Association of each 
school. This provides a funding source for 
environmental education activities that are 
selected in a coordinated effort between 
the schools and the education team of 
the program.

The non-profit group Instituto Auá engages 
with participating schools, seeking to 
understand their specific needs and focus 
areas and then suggesting interesting 
educational activities for students. 

In 2018, we engaged 60 schools and collected 
6,590 liters of used cooking oil. Building on 
that success, in 2019, we continued to build 
the program in Carapicuíba and expanded 
the program to the city of Santos, where we 
operate a port facility. The program collected 
15,300 liters of used cooking oil and engaged 
79 schools.

Innovating Sustainable Materials

boxes. And every pound recycled adds up. 
By recycling one ton of cardboard, it frees up 
nine cubic yards of landfill space.

Bioplastics

In Decatur, Illinois, ADM colleagues at a pilot 
facility work to produce a monomer called 
furan dicarboxylic methyl ester (FDME), which 
is a molecule derived from corn fructose that 
can help lightweight bottles and enhance 
their barrier properties, thus extending 
the shelf-life of products. By using ADM’s 
FDME, DuPont is creating a polymer called 
polytrimethylene furandicarboxylate (PTF), 
a novel polyester also made from DuPont’s 
proprietary Bio-PDO™. PTF is a 100-percent 
renewable and recyclable polymer that—
when used to make bottles and other 
beverage packages—substantially improves 
gas-barrier properties compared to other 
polyesters. PTF can be blended with existing 
PET plastic to help improve performance 
while using less plastic overall, a concept 
known as lightweighting. In combination 
with package-design improvements, this 
approach can reduce the amount of material 
consumed, and reduce costs of shipping and 
delivering food and beverage products.

Cardboard and Starch

Cardboard recycling is already a regular 
practice around the world; however, the 
material is not everlasting. During the 
recycling process, cardboard material, which 
consists of used, short fibers, loses strength. 
Researchers at ADM have discovered an 
innovative way to extend the life of those 
fibers. ADM’s naturally-sourced specialty 
starches work by changing the physical 
chemistry in the cardboard-making process. 
When added to recycled material, our 
positively-charged, or “cationic,” starches 
attract the negatively-charged recycled 
fibers, strengthening their bond. This 
improves the durability and strength of the 
cardboard, increasing the number of times 
the material may be recycled. Adding ADM’s 
specialty starches also improves drainage and 
pressing in papermaking, which improves 
wastewater quality.

“For every ton of recycled cardboard, you 
will save 15 to 20 trees,” said Baljit Ghotra, 
ADM vice president of food research. “That’s 
why it makes sense to recycle, and to recycle 
more often. By adding ADM starch made from 
corn, we’re able to extend the life of a typical 
cardboard box.” In the U.S., over 90% of all 
products are shipped in cardboard boxes, 
which is about 400 billion square feet of 
cardboard. More than half of the cardboard 
collected is recycled to make new cardboard

Food Safety and 
Quality

Food is fundamental. It sustains us, fulfills us 
and fuels our wellbeing. ADM is devoted to 
that impact every single day. And the safety 
and security of our world’s food and feed 
supply chain is of utmost importance. ADM 
leverages systems, expertise and experience 
to ensure we provide wholesome, high-
quality products, including: 

 • The development of risk-based preventive 
controls or critical control points for human 
food based on hazard analysis, both through 
corporate policies and procedures, and 
business unit implementation and execution. 

 • Regularly auditing our own operations, 
and by carefully monitoring our raw 
materials streams. 

 • Earning third-party food-safety 

certifications, such as through the 
Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) at 
approximately 85 percent of our human 
food manufacturing locations in developed 
and developing countries. 

 • Maintaining rigorous Hazard Analysis 
Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems 
at our food and feed processing plants, 
and our U.S.- based locations have 
implemented Hazard Analysis and 
Risk-based Preventive Controls (HARPC) 
as legislated through the Food Safety 
Modernization Act (FSMA). These systems 
have been designed to identify, and 
safeguard against, potential risks at every 
stage of the facility’s operations.

These programs enabled us to achieve zero 
incidents resulting in fines or penalties from 
non-compliance with food regulations or 
from voluntary codes related to the health 
and safety impacts of products or services 
in 2019. 

Workplace Safety

ADM is committed to providing a safe working 
environment for all of our employees and 
contractors. Protecting people and the 
environment is part of everything we do and 
every decision we make. For the last several 
years, we have been on a journey to zero 
injuries – building a safety culture so everyone 
will go home safely to their families and the 
things that are most important to them.

In 2019, more than 80% of our sites completed 
the year without recordable injuries, and 94% 
without lost workday injuries. We experienced 
an increase in the Total Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) of 12%. However, the reduced 
severity of the incidents, resulted in a Lost 
Workday Incident Rate (LWIR) that was 
11% lower than in 2018. In late 2019, we 
restructured our environmental, health and 
safety organization to address particular 
areas of opportunity, specifically items 
around process safety. As a result of this 
reorganization, we now have an enhanced 
focus on transportation and maritime safety. 

We have also launched two efforts to address 
occupational safety:

 • A cross-functional safety culture team to 
drive improvement through simplification 
with an initial focus on higher-risk activities.

 • A coaching and mentoring program to 
provide leadership engagement and 
targeted performance improvement plans 
at underachieving facilities. The program 
takes a deep dive into near misses and 
incidents to identify and implement 
specific, focused improvements.

Through these actions, ADM aims to achieve 
continuous improvement in 2020, including a 
15% reduction in TRIR and a 10% reduction in 
LWIR compared to our 2019 rates.

ADM Cares: Advancing Sustainable 
Agriculture, Increasing Food Security, 
Investing in Education

Through ADM Cares, we contribute to the 
greater good, making a lasting impact through 
partnering with organizations to solve 
challenges. Our corporate social investment 
program aligns our corporate giving with 
our business strategies and sustainability 
objectives. Through the program, ADM 
works to sustain and strengthen our 
commitment to communities where ADM 
colleagues work, live and operate by directing 
funding to initiatives and organizations 
driving meaningful social, economic and 
environmental progress. The ADM Cares 
team evaluates potential projects submitted 
for funding to ensure they meet eligibility 
criteria such as initiatives that support safe, 
responsible and environmentally sound 
agricultural practices in critical growing 
regions around the world.

ADM Cares grants target three focus areas 
that align with ADM’s mission of feeding 
the world: sustainability, hunger relief, and 
education, with a focus on agricultural 
education and science, technology, 
engineering and math (STEM) education. 

1 Advancing Sustainable 

Agriculture

ADM partnered with several 
international organizations in 2019 
to enable growers, and especially 
smallholders, to produce more with 
less. Our sustainable agriculture 
projects have positively impacted 
almost 27,000 farmers and 
their families.

ADM Cares also offers a dollars for doers 
program and matching gift opportunities to 
colleagues as a way to highlight their personal 
contributions and efforts to social investing.

Response

In March 2020, ADM announced it has 
committed approximately $1 million in the 
fight against COVID-19, including to:

 • the World Health Organization’s COVID-19 
Solidarity Response Fund (powered by the 
United Nations Foundation);

 • regional and local charities focusing 

on COVID-19 in the areas where ADM 
operates; and

 • increased employee matching 

contributions to COVID-19 relief and 
mitigation efforts.

In May 2020, ADM announced an additional 
$800,000 in donations to organizations 
focused on addressing needs during 
COVID-19, including food assistance, hunger 
relief, and local support to hospitals and 
first responders. 

To help meet the surge in demand, ADM has 
stepped up its production of industrial ethyl 
alcohol, a key ingredient in hand sanitizer. 
Through ADM Cares, we are donating nearly 
10,000 1.75 liter bottles of hand sanitizer to 
healthcare and long-term care facilities in 
Decatur, Illinois, where the company’s North 
American headquarters are located, to help 
address local needs.

ADM also has available funds for employees 
who have been adversely affected under its 
Colleague Emergency Fund, which provides 
grants to colleagues facing unusual and 
severe financial strain due to sudden crises 
outside of their control.

Zero Hunger

Access to nutrition has the power to solve 
many of the world’s challenges. And as part 
of our dedication to global nutrition, we are 
focused on zero hunger, helping people and 
communities in far corners across the world. 
Although we do not grow crops, we occupy a 
prominent position in the agricultural value 
chain that extends from the farm gate to 
the consumer’s plate, which gives us unique 
insights into consumer trends, such as the 
increasing desire for protein in countries as 
they become wealthier. In addition, our vast 
transportation network allows us to move 
goods from high-harvest areas to regions with 
low or no production. 

ADM works closely with industry peers, trade 
associations, growers, governments, NGOs 
and operating communities to improve the 
quality and availability of crops in the global 
supply chain, and the lives of farmers and 
communities that grow these crops. In doing 
so, ADM supports the effort to end all forms 
of hunger and malnutrition, while promoting 
sustainable agricultural practices and 
improving access to nutritious food.

Nutrition

ADM is growing our range of solutions and 
innovating for improved outcomes while 
giving customers an edge in solving global 
nutritional challenges of today and tomorrow. 
We imagine what’s possible by advancing, 
creating and solving to deliver the next in 
nutrition, backed by science.

As consumers turn towards natural 
health solutions, ADM has been working 
on developing probiotic ingredients and 
supplements to help support the gut 

microbiome which is important for overall 
health and wellness. Here is a look at three 
innovative probiotic solutions designed by 
ADM that bring a natural approach to health.

 • Head Comfort – Headaches, especially 

migraines, can be a source of discomfort 
that impact the quality of life. In a recent 
clinical trial spearheaded by ADM Protexin, 
individuals suffering from either chronic 
or episodic migraines responded to a 
probiotic blend with marked decrease 
in frequency and severity compared to 
the placebo group. This probiotic blend 
combined with magnesium and vitamin 
B6, important nutrients for the function 
of the nervous system, is now available to 
consumers as Bio-Kult Migrea.

 • Overweight and Obesity – In developed 
nations, obesity has reached pandemic 
levels, resulting in alarming rates of 
cardiovascular and metabolic disorders 
as collateral. ADM Biopolis evaluated the 
effect of a live or heat-treated probiotic 
strain in a clinical trial. After three months 
of consuming either form, individuals 
showed an improvement in parameters 
related to body weight or body fat 
compared to the placebo group.

 • Reproductive Health – Infertility affects 
15% of couples, and around 40% of 
these cases appear to be caused by male 
infertility. In a 2017 study, the quality 
of sperm samples taken from a group 
of men with reduced or absent sperm 
motility showed significant improvements 
in sperm mobility after three and six 
weeks of consuming an ADM Biopolis 
probiotic mixture.

TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

Concern Worldwide

Everyone has the right to the food they need to sustain their 
lives. Because of this deeply rooted belief, ADM has committed 
$1,000,000 in a partnership with Concern Worldwide to 
address hunger and malnutrition through two critical pathways 
– lifesaving treatment for acutely malnourished children and 
pregnant and lactating women; and farmer-led agricultural 
transformation to reduce chronic malnutrition. 

The program is divided into two sections:

 • Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)

 • Critical malnutrition treatment is provided in 

malnourished communities.

 • Local health providers are trained to recognize the early 
signs of acute malnutrition, diagnose it, and treat it.

 • Simple diagnostic tools, like paper bands to measure 

upper-arm circumference and clinically proven 
interventions like ready-to-use therapeutic food are 
available in communities.

 • Behavior change: Educate on the benefits of diverse 
diets, proper infant and young child feeding, and 
empowerment of women to make decisions on what 
crops to grow and foods to eat

 • CMAM has been embedded in government and 

 • Public health: Coordinate various government ministries 

international health systems as standard practice for 
treating acute malnutrition in children.

to align their strategies and roll out training to 
community health workers on the ground

 • Realigning Agriculture to Improve Nutrition (RAIN) 

Intervention at three levels – food systems, behavior change, 
and public health.

 • Food systems: Build demand for nutritious fruits, 

vegetables and legumes and support farmers to meet 
the demand by providing inputs and tools and teaching 
farmers new techniques to improve yields

The project has been designed to achieve high impact over 
18 months in two key areas devastated by recent drought. 
Serving over 50,000 beneficiaries through multi-phased 
activities, the project will impact 36,000 people in Kenya 
with acute malnutrition treatment and another 6,000 people 
through agricultural support activities after the initial crisis 
has subsided. In Ethiopia, 10,300 will be impacted through an 
18-month training and vocational program.

Women’s 
Empowerment

ADM has an ongoing commitment to 
smallholders across the globe, especially 
women farmers, and we seek ways to 
support these communities through our 
sourcing practices.

TRANSFORMATION SPOTLIGHT

One Acre Fund’s Alice

Saving for the future is what first prompted 
Alice to plant trees. To her village neighbors—
who regularly struggle with hunger—planting 
an inedible crop seemed illogical. But with the 
nearest savings bank more than hour’s walk 
from her home in rural Kenya, growing a crop 
with the intention of selling it several years 
later presented a unique opportunity.

In search of investment opportunities, 
Alice joined One Acre Fund, a non-profit 
organization supported by ADM Cares that 
“supplies financing and training to help 
smallholders grow their way out of hunger 
and build lasting pathways to prosperity.” This 
allowed her to purchase a variety of farming 
products on credit, including Grevillea 
tree seeds.

Alice had learned about Grevillea trees 
from a One Acre Fund field officer. The fast- 
growing, straight trees are marketable as 
timber for building houses and furniture. In 
addition, Grevillea tree leaves are nutrient-
rich and contribute to soil fertility when 
they fall around the trees. Alice realized that 
by planting Grevillea trees, she could gain 
financial benefits while improving the health 
of her soil and subsequently, her harvest yield.

Grevillea trees, which are worth less 
than $1 USD as saplings, become worth 
roughly $15 USD a piece after six years. 
For smallholder farmers like Alice, this is an 
incredible return on investment. In Western 
Kenya, the profits from just 10 six-year-old 
trees could cover an entire term of a child’s 
high school tuition—and the trees rapidly 
increase in value each year after that. 

Since joining One Acre Fund in 2011, Alice has 
planted Grevillea trees every year. In total, she 
has roughly 65 Grevillea trees scattered about 
her property, growing tall and strong. When 
Alice’s first round of trees reach maturity, 
her 14-year old daughter Wendy will start 
secondary school. With a few of her trees 
already approaching the six-year mark, Alice 
feels she can rest assured that her dreams of 
educating her children will come to be. 

“Wendy hopes to be a doctor someday,” Alice 
says, a smile spreading across her face.

Women & Diversity at ADM

ADM also seeks ways to empower women 
within our company. In 2019, ADM pledged to 
achieve gender parity within the company’s 
senior leadership structure by 2030. Through 
a partnership with Paradigm for Parity – a 
coalition of business leaders dedicated to 
addressing the corporate leadership gender 
gap – ADM has committed to:

 • Addressing unconscious bias in the 

workplace.

 • Significantly increasing the number of 
women in senior operating roles, with 
the near-term goal of at least 30 percent 
representation in all leadership groups.

 • Measuring targets and maintaining 
accountability by providing regular 
progress reports.

 • Basing career progress on business results 
and performance, rather than physical 
presence in the office.

 • Providing sponsors, not just mentors, 

to women well positioned for 
long-term success.

We have already started to make progress 
toward closing the gender gap in our two 
key metric groups – senior leadership and 
salaried colleagues.

ADM promotes a culture of inclusion in 
all roles, at all levels. Our definition of 
diversity is broad, encompassing not only 
diversity in race, gender, ethnicity, economic 
and educational backgrounds - but also in 
experiences, perspectives and interests. Yet 
while our definition of diversity is wide-
ranging, our focus on inclusion is precise.

Having an inclusive culture lets ADM and 
our employees cultivate innovation. We 
believe innovation arises from being open-
minded, listening to multiple perspectives 
and having a willingness to experiment. When 
we put together people whose working and 
thinking styles vary, and encourage people 
to value other opinions, experimentation will 
follow. The results of those experiments are 
innovative solutions to business challenges.

emissions  reported  by  Archer  Daniels  Midland  Company  (ADM)  for  the  period  stated  below.  This  Verification 
Statement applies to the related information included within the scope of work described below.  

The  determination  of  the  GHG  emissions  is  the  sole  responsibility  of  ADM.  ADM  is  responsible  for  the  preparation 
and fair presentation of the GHG statement in accordance with the criteria. Apex’s sole responsibility was to provide 
independent  verification  on  the  accuracy  of  the  GHG  emissions  reported,  and  on  the  underlying  systems  and 
processes used to collect, analyze and review the information. Apex is responsible for expressing an opinion on the 
GHG statement based on the verification. Verification activities applied in a limited level of assurance verification are 
less extensive in nature, timing and extent than in a reasonable level of assurance verification.  

Boundaries of the reporting company GHG emissions covered by the verification: 

•  Operational Control  

•  Worldwide  

•  Exclusions include a small number (<10) of leased office spaces 

Types of GHGs: CO2, N2O, CH4, HFCs, PFCs, SF6,

• 

Limited 

This verification used a materiality threshold of 5% for aggregate errors in sampled data for each of the 
above indicators 

Page 2 

GHG Verification Methodology:  

Evidence-gathering procedures included but were not limited to:  

• 

Interviews with relevant personnel of ADM;  

•  Review of documentary evidence produced by ADM;  

•  Review of ADM’s data and information systems and methodology for collection, aggregation, analysis and 
review  of  information  used  to  determine  GHG  emissions  at  ADM  Headquarters  (Remote)  and  during  site 
visits to Peoria, Illinois and Quincy, Illinois; and  

•  Audit of sample of data used by ADM to determine GHG emissions. 

Verification Opinion: 

Based on the process and procedures conducted, there is no evidence that the GHG emissions statement shown 
above: 

• 

• 

is not materially correct and is not a fair representation of the GHG emissions data and information; and 

has not been prepared in accordance with The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol (Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 GHG emissions). 

It is our opinion that ADM has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of 
quantitative data for determination of these GHG emissions for the stated period and boundaries.
