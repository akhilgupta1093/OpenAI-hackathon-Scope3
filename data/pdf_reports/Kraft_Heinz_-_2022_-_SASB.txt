ABOUT THIS REPORT

This 2021 Environmental Social Governance Report (“Report”) is the third Environmental Social Governance (ESG) report 
issued by The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz” or “Company”). This Report reflects our commitment to transparency 
and provides details for our stakeholders on progress to date against our ESG goals and objectives, which are based on our 
most material ESG issues. These issues were reviewed and updated based on our ESG Materiality assessment. 

This Report does not include details on our financial performance. Details on our financial performance can be found on 
our corporate website and in our public filings available through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Materiality and its relevant definition as used in this report, sometimes referenced as “ESG materiality,” and our ESG 
materiality review process, is different than the definition used in the context of filings with the SEC. Issues deemed material 
for purposes of this Report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategies may not be considered material for SEC 
reporting purposes.

Unless otherwise noted, this Report covers initiatives and performance metrics associated with our global operations from 
January 1 through December 31, 2020. Kraft Heinz anticipates issuing an annual ESG Report.

We have utilized the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding framework in the development of 
our ESG initiatives. This Report also serves as our Communication on Progress as a signatory to the United Nations Global 
Compact and CEO Water Mandate.

This Report was prepared utilizing the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Standard. We have also aligned this 
Report to the general principles of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for food and beverage companies, 
as well as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Separate downloads of our GRI, SASB and TCFD 
disclosures are available on our website at www.kraftheinzcompany.com/esg

Kraft Heinz engaged with Bureau Veritas and SGS to provide limited assurance in relation to specific 2020 environmental 
data. Details on our assurance activities are available in the appendix of this Report and on our website. 

Kraft Heinz supports the SDGs, which represent a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure 
prosperity for all. As such, we considered the SDGs when developing Kraft Heinz’s global ESG strategy and goals. The 
global ESG strategy of Kraft Heinz supports all 17 SDGs in varying degrees. We have identified the main places in this 
Report to demonstrate the key ways our initiatives work towards the targets aligned with the SDGs. This is represented by 
the appropriate icons preceding those correlating sections throughout the report. 

We welcome feedback on our ESG strategy and commitments. To share questions or comments, please contact

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXA LETTER FROM THE CEO

At The Kraft Heinz Company, we talk often about the power of our scale and agility. When we began 
2020, little did we know how our Company’s ability to rapidly change course and respond to a new set 
of realities would impact the lives of so many consumers around the world. 

Last year brought us challenges unlike any we have faced in our lifetimes. First came the arrival of 
COVID-19, creating an unprecedented crisis of health, economic instability, and food insecurity. 
Months later, this once-in-a-century pandemic was followed by worldwide demands for social justice 
and racial equality. These crises – not to mention the ongoing threat of climate change to the world’s 
environment – have reshaped all of our lives. And the most vulnerable among us have been hit 
especially hard by all three.

The state of world events demanded that global companies like ours step up to the plate. To help 
feed the world. To demand justice and equality. To help create a fairer world for all of us. As one of the 
world’s largest food and beverage companies, we have both a responsibility and the ambition to help 
create a healthier and more sustainable environment. 

There has never been a greater need.

Times of great change also represent great opportunity. Our 2021 ESG Report – where we reflect on 
what we as a Company achieved over the past year, along with the progress we still need to make – 
serves as a testament to our approximately 38,000 global employees who went above and beyond to 
support our communities and each other during 2020. If the past year taught us anything, it is that we 
are all connected. We all feel the impact of each other’s actions and inactions – whether as a result of a 
global pandemic, systemic racial injustice, or environmental change. 

Looking ahead, we are committed to holding ourselves to a higher standard, stepping up to the plate 
to boldly address the challenges that lie ahead. We invite all of our stakeholders to join us on this 
journey to help transform the future.

Last year, we introduced the cross-functional approach we are taking to Environmental Social 
Governance (ESG) at Kraft Heinz as we work to deliver on our commitments by the year 2025. Three 
broad pillars center our ESG commitments and goals: Healthy Living & Community Support, 
Environmental Stewardship, and Responsible Sourcing. Our ESG strategy also brings to life one of 
our six Company Values, We do the right thing. We are committed to making this real in every aspect 
of our business. We are focusing on high-priority issues in areas where we can make the greatest 
impact. Doing the right thing is essential to how we operate – and it is essential to the success of our 
long-term business strategy.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGINTRODUCTIONHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXA Letter from the CEO (cont.) 

Although 2020 was a year of challenges, we made significant 
progress against our ESG goals – including some we are especially 
excited about:

•  In the wake of last year’s crises, we provided more than  

$40 million in financial and product donations for COVID-19 
relief, food insecurity, and social justice causes globally...

 » Including $1 million to support food programs and social 

justice organizations in African American communities most 
affected by social injustice and the pandemic. 

•  We are on track to achieve our goal of delivering 1.5 billion 
meals to people in need around the world by 2025 – and 
delivered more than 200 million meals in 2020 – as part of our 
Company commitment to fight global hunger. 

•  Having achieved our previous nutrition targets, in 2020 we 

initiated even more ambitious plans to renovate and innovate 
across our product portfolio. 

•  We’re making great strides toward meeting our aim of using 

100% recyclable, reusable, or compostable packaging by 2025. 
We’re proud that through 2020, 83% of our global packaging 
meets this standard.

•  We delivered our goal of achieving 100% free-range eggs 
in Europe as of Jan. 1, 2021 – meeting our commitment 
timeframe.

•  We evolved our Sustainable Agriculture Practices Manual and 
launched our journey to delivering Supplier Guiding Principles 
to further enhance our supply chain sustainability and greatly 
increase shared value and transparency around human rights, 
the environment, and our overall ESG practices.

While we believe in celebrating our successes and achievements, 
we also believe in holding ourselves accountable for the work that 
still needs to be done. Another one of our Company Values is We 
dare to do better every day. We must be honest and transparent 
about where we have fallen short. We are committed to 
identifying and learning from our gaps as we make real, substantial 
improvement across all aspects of ESG.

In 2020, we amplified our focus on Diversity, Inclusion, and 
Belonging, which furthers our ability to fully live another two of our 
Company Values – We demand diversity and We are consumer 
obsessed. We expect our employees to look like the consumers 
we serve. We want the voices within our Company to reflect and 

represent our consumers as we innovate our products, create 
our marketing, and partner with customers and suppliers. We 
created Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging aspirations to grow our 
Company’s underrepresented talent around the world and foster a 
more inclusive company culture. 

By the year 2025, we aim to achieve gender parity – which means 
increasing the representation of women in management from 37% 
to 50%. We also aim to reach demographic parity in the countries 
where we operate by 2025. In the United States, for example, our 
aspiration is for people of color to represent 30% of our salaried 
employees by 2025 – whereas this population stands at 24% today. 
We also aspire to nurture a culture of inclusion, so all employees 
from all backgrounds feel that they belong at the Kraft Heinz table.  

In addition, last year in the United States, we made 10 specific 
commitments to demonstrate our solidarity with and provide equity 
for African Americans at our Company and in the communities we 
serve. Although the commitments originated in the United States, 
our actions have expanded across the globe. Open and honest 
conversations with members of our Black Business Resource Group 
and Company leadership led to these commitments, which include: 

We report annually on our ESG progress, and this Report serves 
as our Communication on Progress as part of our commitments 
to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and the UNGC’s 
CEO Water Mandate. I invite you to visit our ESG website – which 
includes videos highlighting our ESG and Diversity, Inclusion, and 
Belonging achievements, aspirations, and commitments – and read 
this Report, detailing how we are working hard to bring these goals 
to life.  

We believe in using our size, scale, and agility to drive real and 
positive change inside and outside the walls of Kraft Heinz – all to 
achieve our Company Vision “To sustainably grow by delighting 
more consumers globally.” 

That’s what stepping up to the plate is all about. 

•  Launching the Kraft Heinz Global Inclusion Council, which  

I chair, to create true accountability for results and oversight.

Miguel Patricio 
Chief Executive Officer 
The Kraft Heinz Company

•  Introducing a mentoring program for Black employees. 

•  Creating the WeLead Program to help prepare Black 
employees for future leadership roles at Kraft Heinz. 

•  Designating a Global Day of Service for our employees in 

honor of the Juneteenth holiday that marks the end of slavery 
in the United States, encouraging them to learn, volunteer, and 
support social justice efforts in communities where we live and 
do business. Our teams around the world – including those 
in Canada, the Netherlands, U.K. and Brazil – also have or will 
hold their own Day of Service activities in honor of Black history 
and contributions in their countries.

•  Launching a new Supplier Diversity Program for businesses that 
are majority-owned by people of color, women, those in the 
LGBTQI+ community, people with disabilities, and veterans. 
The Program will help these businesses gain access to essential 
skills, tools, and networks – giving them the opportunity to 
become Kraft Heinz suppliers.

ESG Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement  

To inform and continuously improve upon our ESG strategy, we engage a wide variety of stakeholders for input. Participating in an ongoing, two-way 
dialogue with our stakeholders strengthens our understanding of important environmental, social and governance issues, which helps us set associated 
priorities to make respective impacts. 

Our global stakeholder network includes both the internal and external people and parties whose support is critical to the long-term success of our business, 
or who are materially impacted by our business operations. The table below lists these groups and summarizes our engagement activities with them.

To inform our ESG strategy and goal-setting, Kraft Heinz conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality 
assessment every three to five years, with respective smaller interim updates as appropriate. This 
assessment allows us to identify and prioritize the environmental, social and governance issues that are 
of greatest concern to our stakeholders and which impact the success of our business. We reevaluate 
these results on an ongoing basis to reflect any changes in standing on these priority issues and allow for 
the inclusion of new or emerging issues. 

We treat our ESG materiality matrix as a living assessment based on participant input. We continue 
to evaluate material ESG issues to our key stakeholders and the respective impact on our business 
operations across dynamic global markets. 

Our ESG materiality matrix depicts the outcomes of the following assessments:

2016: We developed our first ESG materiality assessment as a new company. 

2019: We added several issues to reflect their rising importance to our stakeholders and potential 
business impacts, including Consumer Trends and Innovation, Food Waste, Diversity and Inclusion, and 
Ingredient Transparency and Responsible Labeling. 

2020: As a result of additional engagement with key business partners and employees, we adjusted 
the weight of “Human Rights” materiality, as well as separated out “Sustainable Sourcing/Agriculture,” 
adjusted the nomenclature to more accurately reflect the area of impact for Kraft Heinz, and weighted 
accordingly, into the two distinct areas of “Responsible Sourcing” and “Sustainable Agriculture.” We 
also adopted the nomenclature of Environmental Social Governance (ESG) as the overarching framework 
for the Kraft Heinz sustainability platform.

We remain committed to corporate responsibility and providing value to our stakeholders. We believe 
our ESG guiding framework further demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility, while 
highlighting the importance of continuous improvement and transparency in these efforts. We continue 
to work on enhancing our risk-based and financial disclosures on these ESG topics. 

Enterprise Risk Management

Kraft Heinz has an established, comprehensive approach to Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). 
Annually, senior management evaluates changes and required updates to the top enterprise risks. The 
ERM process covers a broad spectrum of risks across several dimensions: strategic, financial, operational, 
legal & regulatory, human capital, and hazard/catastrophic. Senior management prioritizes the risks and 
develops the Kraft Heinz risk profile, which is shared with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
annually. Each risk owner provides regular updates to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

political process is transparency and disclosure. Kraft Heinz files 
all information as required by federal and state campaign finance 
and disclosure laws. The Kraft Heinz PAC reports its contributions 
to the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the details of which are 
publicly available on the FEC internet site. 

All Kraft Heinz PAC and Company political contributions since 
2012 are listed on our website. This includes contributions to ballot 
initiatives and 501(c)(4) organizations where funds may be utilized 
for political purposes. This information is updated semi-annually. In 
addition, Kraft Heinz partners with outside counsel to conduct an 
annual internal audit of all lobbying practices and reporting. 

Lobbying Activity

Kraft Heinz prepares and submits reports with the Secretary of the 
U.S. Senate and the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives 
quarterly, which detail lobbying activities and expenditures. These 
reports are available here. The Company also files lobbying reports 
with many U.S. state and municipal governments as required by 
law. These reports are publicly available through the websites of 
the jurisdictions where they are filed.

Trade Association Membership

Kraft Heinz believes that trade association membership and 
participation provides a number of benefits to our business and 
employees, including the ability to remain engaged on relevant 
issues and as a forum for sharing ideas and information.

The Company’s involvement with trade associations does not 
include engaging in political activity. Kraft Heinz instructs trade 
associations that our dues must only be used on issues of 
importance to our business and none may be provided to support 
or oppose political candidates. Find language sent to trade 
associations here.

Center for Political Accountability 

Kraft Heinz has proudly doubled its score since 2015 on the 
“CPA-Zicklin Index,” a rating developed by the Center for Political 
Accountability in conjunction with the Carol and Lawrence Zicklin 
Center for Business Ethics Research at The Wharton School, 
University of Pennsylvania. The full report can be found here.

In support of our Vision To sustainably grow by delighting more consumers globally, we are committed to responsible, sustainable practices extending to 
every facet of our business. The Kraft Heinz ESG strategy prioritizes the issues that matter most to the Company business and stakeholders, focusing on areas 
that have the greatest impact. It includes three key pillars: Healthy Living & Community Support, Environmental Stewardship and Responsible Sourcing. 

Our goal is to build value among our Company’s broad set of stakeholders by incorporating socially responsible business practices within our own operations 
and across every stage of our supply chain. We’re setting ambitious environmental goals, sourcing sustainably, improving the products we sell and making 
impactful advancements in communities – all with a commitment to transparency and two-way dialogue. This continues to be our way forward.

Healthy Living  
& Community Support

Environmental  
Stewardship

Responsible  
Sourcing

A key part of our corporate strategy is a 
commitment to people, to nutrition and health, 
and making life delicious all at once. Some of the 
actions we are taking to support this commitment 
include ongoing improvements to the nutrition 
of our product portfolio, transparent and 
responsible marketing and communications, and 
alignment with credible science and public  
health goals.

Through these actions, we aim to contribute 
to the key priorities and target achievements 
outlined by the World Health Organization’s 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control 
of Noncommunicable Diseases, and the United 
Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.

Environmental stewardship begins with our 
operational footprint, where we actively strive  
to conserve water and energy, reduce emissions, 
minimize waste and make our  
packaging sustainable. 

At Kraft Heinz, we not only believe in striving  
to be better every day within our own operations, 
but we aspire to work with our entire value 
chain to continually improve on social and 
environmental factors. 

Our manufacturing sites can consume substantial 
amounts of resources, and are controlled 
by us, so we focus significant efforts around 
environmental stewardship inside of our walls.

We are dedicated to responsible sourcing  
and related impacts in critical areas to Kraft Heinz 
and our stakeholders. These include areas of 
focus such as human rights, deforestation, animal 
welfare and sustainable agriculture. We are also 
committed to strengthening our due diligence 
and management programs, while keeping the 
needs of our suppliers and our customers  
a top priority.

Our COVID-19 Response  

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health and financial wellbeing of millions of people 
around the world. The daily count of global cases and associated deaths are a stark reminder of 
the vastness and depth of this tragic pandemic. In an effort to contain the virus’ spread, the world’s 
largest economies have been deeply impacted, resulting in simultaneous economic crises, with 
countless citizens around the world experiencing job loss and financial hardship, in addition to 
illness and even death.  

Keeping Food on the Shelves

Looking Out for Each Other

Kraft Heinz is committed to providing nutritious meals to those 
in need and eliminating global hunger --- and the need has been 
unparalleled during the COVID-19 global pandemic.  

In the early days of the pandemic, the food value chain 
experienced unprecedented supply shortages. Across the world, 
our plants stepped up to meet this moment - from soy sauce 
in China to baby biscuits in Italy to Heinz Beans in the U.K., our 
employees have responded by making the products people know, 
love and trust. Faced with all sorts of challenges, our employees 
have been agile, resourceful and creative. People, working as a 
team, are doing extraordinary things.

In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 
2020, we immediately launched a global taskforce, 
provided enhanced benefits and implemented 
additional robust workplace safety programs and 
processes in all of our facilities – which became 
a leading benchmark with many agencies. As the 
circumstances and impacts of COVID-19 evolved, we 
continued to adapt our response to protect the health and 
safety of our employees. Read more about our enhanced 
wellbeing programs as part of our LiveWell program 
including benefits, disability and employee assistance 
initiatives on page 26.

SPOTLIGHT ON MONT ROYAL

Working 24/7 to Keep  
Kraft Dinner on Grocery Shelves 

Our Mont Royal, Quebec plant is responsible for supplying all of Canada's 
Kraft Dinner supply. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
manufacturing team worked non-stop to produce 1 million extra boxes to 
meet an unprecedented demand.

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the factory produced approximately 3 
million boxes of Kraft Dinner, five days per week. With our lines running 
24/7, we pumped out more than 4 million boxes daily. We continued this 
increased production schedule from March 2020 to the second quarter of 
2021. 

During this time, plant manager Danielle Nguyen was also committed 
to making sure that appropriate safety protocols were followed and that 
employees received the adequate rest time to avoid burn out. Employees 
prepared business continuity protocols to ensure continued production in 
the event anyone tested positive for COVID-19 or began showing symptoms.

"Everyone just feels very, very proud to be feeding 37 million Canadians," 
Nguyen says. "Our 960 employees show up to work every day. To me, they 
are true heroes.”

#WeGotYouAmerica:  
How One Employee 
Started a Movement 

Brooke Burk, a human resources business partner at our Springfield, Missouri manufacturing facility, felt 
a calling to step up and support fellow employees during the initial wave of COVID-19. As a member 
of the local HR team, Brooke was given the flexibility to work from home but decided to remain at the 
facility, in person, to support COVID-19 mitigation efforts. She oversaw social distancing at the factory – 
from production lines to the breakroom.

During this time, Brooke saw corporate workers posting pictures of themselves working from home on 
Kraft Heinz’s internal social media platform, KetchApp. She then took photos on the factory floor and 
posted them with the hashtag “#WeGotYouAmerica.” She wanted to inspire and remind employees 
that we were all playing an integral role in ensuring that food reached grocery shelves across the country 
to people that needed it. The tagline inspired many Kraft Heinz employees and quickly spread beyond 
the Springfield facility to other plants. It began appearing on posters as a call to action to inspire the 
Kraft Heinz team during this difficult time.

The #WeGotYouAmerica campaign culminated in a video, shot entirely by employees at our Fremont, 
Ohio and Champaign, Illinois facilities using only their smartphone cameras. The video was then 
featured as a commercial to show the world that Kraft Heinz was here to stay and that together, we can 
get through COVID-19. See the full commercial here.

During COVID-19

When this unprecedented public health crisis escalated in early 2020, Kraft Heinz jumped into 
action. In March 2020, we launched a global campaign and committed to donating $12 million to help 
ensure people across the globe had access to the food they need during the pandemic. This international 
commitment included both financial and product donations. The following are highlights of Kraft Heinz 
initiatives that helped support communities around the world:  

Magic Breakfast 

Project Pantry and Pantry Day

Partnership with Babytree

In the United Kingdom, Heinz partnered 
with Magic Breakfast, a charity that 
provides healthy school breakfasts to 
hungry and malnourished children in 
disadvantaged areas of the U.K., to 
secure 12 million free breakfasts for school 
children who needed them the most. The 
partnership equated to one breakfast per day, 
five days per week over eight weeks, for school children in the 
U.K. who would usually benefit from access to breakfast club 
programs that were cancelled as a result of schools closing.

On top of this, Heinz partnered with U.K. NGO Pro Bono 
Economics and Magic Breakfast to produce a policy report 
showing that a government breakfast provision in the U.K. 
could raise £2.7 billion for the economy, with a benefit-cost 
ratio of 50:1. This report reached over 425 U.K. Members of 
Parliament.

The partnership has also featured compelling consumer-facing 
activations. In September 2020, Heinz and Magic Breakfast 
launched the ‘Silence the Rumble’ campaign to raise awareness 
for the child hunger crisis in the U.K. The campaign, which 
included an animated advertisement, was a huge success both 
in terms of raising awareness, and stimulating £80,000 in public 
donations for Magic Breakfast.

In response to the global pandemic, Kraft 
Heinz Canada initiated Project Pantry, 
where we donated 1 million meals and 
personal protective equipment supplies 
(approximately 40,000 masks, 20,000 
pairs of gloves and 3,900 1L bottles of 
cleaning/disinfecting solution) to Food 
Banks Canada, our long-time food donation 
partner.

The Kraft Heinz Company partnered with 
Babytree, one of the largest parenting websites 
in China, to donate more than 4,000 boxes 
of Heinz infant food to families in need 
through the Shanghai Fosun Foundation. 
The Company’s products were delivered to 25 
hospitals in five Chinese provinces most severely 
affected by the outbreak including Hubei, Hunan, 
Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Henan. 

Building off of that initial engagement, Kraft Heinz Pantry Day 
was established (pictured above). Pantry Day encourages 
Canadians to join the fight against food insecurity by 
purchasing a participating Kraft Heinz product at their local 
grocery store, which is then matched with a similar food 
donation to Food Banks Canada.  

Project Pantry and Pantry Day are part of Kraft Heinz Canada’s 
5-year, $20-million product donation commitment that will help 
bring meals to the tables of the 4.4 million Canadians affected 
by food insecurity. Kraft Heinz Project Pantry and Pantry Day 
mark another chapter in Kraft Heinz Canada’s long history of 
supporting food banks across the country. 

“We are thankful to have found a great long-term partner in 
Kraft Heinz Canada,” says Chris Hatch, Chief Executive Officer, 
Food Banks Canada. “The Kraft Heinz Pantry Day commitment 
makes them our largest consumer packaged goods supporter 
and this donation will go a long way in helping us to deliver vital 
food aid to Canadians in need.”

Feeding America 

Kraft Heinz also pledged $1.9 million in cash to Feeding 
America®, the largest domestic hunger relief organization 
in the United States, to help support food banks located 
in and near places where the Company has offices and 
plants, such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository and 
the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Feeding 
America’s COVID-19 Response Fund helps food banks across 
the country as they support communities impacted by the 
pandemic, enabling them to secure the resources they need to 
efficiently serve some of the most vulnerable people.

America on page 31.

Stepping Up to Support  
Healthcare Facilities

Healthcare workers greeting Kraft Heinz Employees  
as they arrived with personal protective equipment donations

At Kraft Heinz, we pride ourselves on being good neighbors 
and partners for our communities. During the initial wave of 
COVID-19, personal protective equipment supplies were in 
short supply and many healthcare facilities struggled to source 
these items to keep up with the increased demand. Many of 
our facilities around the world stepped up to donate existing 
stock that would have been used during the manufacturing 
process.

For example, in March 2020, our Kraft Heinz plant in South 
Carolina donated N95 masks, surgical gowns, lab coats, face 
shields, fabric hood protective equipment and PDI Sani-Cloth 
containers to Lexington Medical Center, Newberry County 
Memorial Hospital, and Self-Regional Healthcare Hospital.

about how they were going to make it through the initial phases of 
COVID-19 without the proper supplies. The fact that our plant could 
have this opportunity to directly impact healthcare workers, their 
families and the community was wonderful. We look forward to doing 
more,” Kat Longerbeam, Human Resources, Newberry Plant.

Kraft Heinz also donated $1.5 million worth of products to impacted 
people in Australia and New Zealand, and 1 million servings of 
Lunchables and Capri Sun products to school children in the Dallas, 
Texas area. Kraft Heinz brands, including Heinz ketchup and Oscar 
Mayer, have responded to the crisis in their own ways, expanding the 
company’s impact. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we continue to 
evaluate our response and adapt to ensure the health and safety of our 
employees, and support for impacted communities.

Company Foundation on page 29.

days of my 20 years with Kraft Heinz.”

2020 was a year that amplified our focus on diversity, inclusion, and belonging. We expanded our Company 
Values to affirm, We demand diversity, and launched our Global Inclusion Council, chaired by our CEO, Miguel 
Patricio. The Council comprises executive leadership from across the Company and members of our Board 
of Directors. The Council creates strategic accountability for results, and provides governance, oversight, and 
reporting on diversity efforts and initiatives. The Council is also a critical driver in fostering real organizational change, 
establishing priorities, managing integrated and cross-functional initiatives, and thoughtfully considering how to fully 
live our Company Values.

We strengthened our commitment to a diverse workforce by targeting employee 
representation that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. 

We know a truly inclusive culture allows our people to contribute their unique perspectives and ideas, execute with excellence, and 
grow great careers. Moreover, we have set aspirations that are critical to our diversity, inclusion, and belonging journey while increasing 
accountability.

Additional demographic aspirations will continue to be developed for countries in which we operate as we collect accurate and complete 
data across our global footprint. And we will seek to qualify these values and metrics with supplemental external recognition.

Our Aspirations for Kraft Heinz, by 2025:

50%  

of our global 
management positions 
will be filled by women

30%  

of our salaried U.S. 
employee population will

Impact Across  
Our Global Footprint

2020 was a year of transformational growth for Kraft Heinz – and in the U.S., we had 
an opportunity to put our new Value, We demand diversity, to the test. As the spotlight 
intensified on racial and social injustice across the country, here at Kraft Heinz, we felt 
compelled to take action. In the second quarter, we announced several commitments to 
positively impact Kraft Heinz and our communities. Our Black Business Resource Group (BRG) 
was instrumental, partnering with Company leadership to establish our commitments and 
contributed to bold and honest conversations across the Company. These commitments focused 
on four areas – recruitment; employee support and development; leadership and representation; 
and community support. Here are a few highlights from our commitment areas during the year: 

Annual Day of Service

Employee Development

June 19, 2020 marked our inaugural Kraft Heinz Day of Service 
– now a part of our annual calendar. Observed in the U.S. on 
Juneteenth, the Day of Service commemorated and honored 
the importance of the day while providing opportunities 
for employees to participate in virtual and in-person service 
and educational events. Our colleagues in the Canada and 
International Zones also hosted Days of Service in solidarity with 
the U.S.

Community Support

We provided $1 million in financial support to social justice 
organizations and food-focused programs that supported 
communities hardest hit by social inequities in 2020. Those 
organizations included the United Negro College Fund, My 
Block My Hood My City, Second Harvest Heartland Food Bank, 
and 412 Food Rescue, among others. 

To further the development of our Black employees, in 
2020 we launched a Black BRG Mentoring Program and 
the WeLead Accelerator Program. WeLead was designed 
to drive accelerated career growth for our Black employees 
and those who identify as two or more races at the individual 
contributor level. During this five-month immersive program, 
36 participants in the first cohort learned critical business and 
communication skills, built connections, and activated our 
Values through our leadership principles. WeLead is now an 
ongoing, annual program. Participants in this program now 
include employees of color from throughout the U.S.

Additionally, we launched The WE Network, a global leadership 
accelerator for women at the Associate Director level. The first 
cohort of 30 women graduated in October 2020.

Recruiting 

We committed to strengthening our partnerships with Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities. As just one example, we partnered 
with Clark Atlanta University, through the CEO Academy, to work 
with over 100 junior and senior students on networking, LinkedIn 
best practices, and learning about a day in the life of a marketer. 
Kraft Heinz employees from across the organization participated 
in six class sessions throughout the winter 2020 term. We also 
partnered with Howard University, through its 21 Cap program. In 
this program, we worked with 25 students on a semester long case 
study. The winning team was awarded Kraft Heinz branded prizes 
and the top two students, voted on by their peers, were each 
awarded a $1,500 scholarship from Kraft Heinz. 

In Canada, we enhanced our inclusive recruitment processes to 
increase the diversity of our talent pools. We introduced blind 
resume reviews, bias interruption training, and scanning our job 
descriptions through a gender bias decoder. 

Like our BRGs in the U.S. and International Zones, our Canadian 
Diversity Committee shifted to a virtual environment which was 
instrumental in connecting employees throughout 2020. We 
celebrated cultural diversity through educational opportunities. 
Various events were held throughout the year including, 
International Women’s Day, Juneteenth, Orange Shirt Day, Day for 
People with Disabilities, and Pride Month.

Additionally, we focused on the communities in which we operate 
to make an impact. We joined other top-tier Canadian corporate 
partners and became a proud signatory of the BlackNorth Pledge. 
The BlackNorth Initiative is on a mission to end anti-Black systemic 
racism in Canada by leveraging the strength of corporate Canada 
to demand and lead change. Kraft Heinz Canada also established 
a partnership with the Hockey Diversity Alliance (HDA) to further 
the HDA’s mission by creating opportunities for racialized Canadian 

youth to access and experience the sport of hockey at the 

grassroots level through various HDA-sponsored programs, 

events, and initiatives.

2020 was also a year of BRG growth for our 

International Zone, which includes over 30 
countries, as more employees engaged 
in local chapters and started initiatives

and financial well-being at Kraft Heinz, and its mission is to foster a 
culture of care and empathy where  we can bring our whole selves 
to work.

Reconciliation Action Plan: an Australian local BRG dedicated 
to strengthening relationships between Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Australians and non-Indigenous Australians. Its 
mission is threefold: create a workplace that understands, values, 
and respects the histories, cultures, and contributions of the 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community; develop respectful 
relationships with the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander community; 
create meaningful social change and economic opportunities for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.

Our Value, We demand diversity, continues to guide our efforts 
across our global footprint and our employees are excited for the 
opportunity to bring this value to life in new ways. The increase 
in BRG participation is one of many powerful indicators that our 
employees are engaged in our diversity, inclusion, and belonging 
efforts. As a global organization, we are looking forward to 
continuing to create a diverse environment where all employees 
feel included, recognized, and supported, with a sense of 
belonging at Kraft Heinz.

Employee  
Health & Wellness

In May 2018, Kraft Heinz launched its new LiveWell health and wellness platform in the U.S. 
following a successful Canadian campaign. Today, LiveWell at Kraft Heinz continues to underscore 
our commitment to helping employees achieve optimal health. This commitment includes physical, 
emotional, financial and social health and well-being. Kraft Heinz realizes that life does not stop for 
work. Throughout the year, we utilize LiveWell to address various topics concerning health and well-
being through speaker series, global and local events, and targeted initiatives on physical fitness, 
mental health, family and community, and financial education. We have created a LiveWell hub 
for employees to easily access relevant external resources and link to programs available in their 
local countries. We have continued to champion the LiveWell program’s holistic approach to well-
being in response to COVID-19 with enhanced programs, including healthcare benefits, disability and 
employee assistance initiatives. 

At Kraft Heinz, we’ve worked to address the stigma attached to discussing and supporting 
mental health and well-being in the workplace.  Recognizing that this stigma is compounded 
in underrepresented groups, we elevated our plan to support all of our employees.  In 2020, 
we focused on mental well-being around the world with several key initiatives: supporting 
people managers with specific communications and learning resources; offering several 
learning opportunities for all employees to hear from experts about building resiliency 
and taking care of your emotional well-being; and launching our Global LiveWell 
site which includes a section on Health & Wellbeing.  We also provided Calm app 
subscriptions to our U.S. and U.K. employees as an added benefit. 

Our International Zone worked to upskill our Human Resources (HR) Teams with Mental 
Health First Aid training, resulting in over 60 HR employees across the zone receiving a 
certification in 2020. Our aim is to have at least one Mental Health First Aider in each of 
our offices and factories. An integral part of our Mental Health First Aid Training is self-care 
– you can’t assist others without putting your own oxygen mask on first.

Employees not only #MakeTimeForLearning, they also share what they learn with other employees through a Kraft Heinz 
internal communications platform called KetchApp. 500 Kraft Heinz learners made commitments in Q4 2019; these 500 
learners completed over 3,000 hours of learning in that quarter. In 2020, the movement grew, and over 1,100 employees 
made a #LearnLikeAnOwner commitment and engaged in over 44,000 learning experiences. 

Since Ownerversity’s inception in 2016, the global and zone learning teams have expanded the Kraft Heinz library to include 
custom Kraft Heinz learning experiences and curated playlists to help employees find training more easily. We launched the 
next evolution of Ownerversity in December 2020. The new Ownerversity experience was designed to motivate employees

Working to Alleviate  
Global Hunger

The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation (Kraft Heinz Foundation) pursues its 
mission through strategic partnerships with organizations that have programs 
aligned with hunger relief, nutrition support and self-sustaining food sources. 
Kraft Heinz employees from all corners of the world have passionately joined 
the Foundation through volunteer efforts towards our goals, highlighting the 
critical nature and immediacy of our work in alleviating world hunger. 

Deliver 1.5 billion meals to people in need  
by 2025 against our 2019 baseline. 

PROGRESS

ON TRACK: 23%

We are proud of the progress we’ve made upon our original goal to deliver 1 billion nutritious meals to those in need by 2021. At the end of 
2020, through a combination of financial support and product donations, we have delivered more than 745 million meals to those in need 
since 2016. We have put our foot on the accelerator, and in 2020 we provided more than 206 million meals to people in need. Our current 
total for 2019-2020 has now broached 345 million meals to those in need toward our new 1.5 billion meal target by 2025 – we’re 23 
percent of the way there. 

The Kraft Heinz  
Micronutrient 
Campaign

We have aligned our current key partners towards this goal:

The Kraft Heinz 
Micronutrient Campaign, established by the H.J. Heinz 
Holding Corporation in 2001, aims to use the skills and 
compassion of our employees to develop a nutritional 
supplement to promote healthy growth and development 
of those in hunger in developing regions around the 
world. 

Understanding that nutrition and food are pivotal in the 
growth and success of a child, and especially significant 
for malnourished children across the globe, Kraft Heinz 
created this micronutrient sachet with essential vitamins 
and minerals, to be mixed in with more readily available 
food without all these benefits.

The Kraft Heinz Foundation has been a partner of Rise Against Hunger since its inception. Originating 
from the desire to provide nutritious and efficient meals to those facing hunger across the world, our 
partnership with Rise Against Hunger now impacts a wide variety of issues ranging from addressing 
global hunger from localized, urgent needs to wider systemic, long-term projects. Today, we are Rise 
Against Hunger’s largest partner. 

The following are key areas of focus in Kraft Heinz’s strategic partnership with Rise Against Hunger:

“Rise Against Hunger impacts millions of lives each year, and we would not be able to do so without the  
dedicated support of Kraft Heinz. In 2020, as the world faced the pandemic’s unprecedented effects, our top priority  
was — and always will be — supporting the people we serve, working to alleviate hunger around the world. Rise Against Hunger 
served over 2.8 million people facing hunger in 41 countries last year. Our continued partnership with Kraft Heinz will allow us  
to impact more lives and continue the crucial fight to end global hunger.”

Feeding America

Feeding America® is a nationwide network of 
200 foodbanks and 60,000 food pantries with 
meal programs that serve every county in America. In Feeding 
America’s words, “to end hunger, we have to make hunger 
unacceptable,” and that is why the organization encourages 
everyone to take action in the fight to end hunger – an issue that 
impacts one in nine of our neighbors.

Our relationship with Feeding America dates back to Kraft 
Foods Group. Inc., as one of the original groups to provide the 
organization with financial support in the 1980s.

Today Kraft Heinz helps Feeding America achieve its mission in 
a three-pronged approach. First, we help them meet immediate 
hunger needs through food donations from our corporate 
operations. In 2020, we donated more than 20 million pounds 
of food to Feeding America through 33 local food banks aligned 
with our U.S. manufacturing sites, bringing our total since 2016 to 
more than 102 million pounds of food donated. Second, through 
The Kraft Heinz Foundation’s philanthropic giving we are able 
to significantly amplify food donations to families in need on a 
planned basis. Third, we furthermore partner with Feeding America 
through cause marketing and volunteerism, all aimed at our shared 
mission to end hunger.

“Feeding America is thankful to the Kraft Heinz Foundation for its generous 
support of hunger-relief programs that support children, seniors and local food 
banks. Their commitment to fighting hunger has helped provide more meals to 
our neighbors who need it most.” 

– Casey Marsh, Chief Development Officer at Feeding America

Heifer International

Founded in 1944, Heifer International is a 
global nonprofit working to eradicate hunger 
poverty through sustainable, values-based holistic community 
development. Heifer International provides animals, along with 
agricultural and values-based training, to families in need around 

and 

the world as a means of providing self-sufficiency. These families 
are able to earn a living income and continuously lift up their 
communities as they train the next generation of leaders. In 2020, 
The Kraft Heinz Foundation Board Members recognized Heifer 
International’s long-standing and game-changing model to be a 
perfect complement towards its mission of self-sustaining hunger 
relief, and thereby enlisted this new key partnership to great and 
immediate impacts.

“Strategic partnerships like this one between Heifer International and Kraft Heinz 
will enable us to connect more people in need with fresh, healthy food, while 
building food systems to support long term availability and a more equitable 
future for producers and consumers. Non-profits and for-profits doing the right 
thing together will provide a greater impact in helping to alleviate hunger and 
poverty. Together, we will be providing 81.1 million meals (in 2020) to families 
in rural communities across the world. We are proud of this partnership and the 
good we are doing together.” 

– Pierre Ferrari, CEO, Heifer International 

Share our Strength: 
No Kid Hungry Campaign

Share Our Strength is an organization that has 
created and led innovative ways to help people 
out of poverty for 35 years. In 2020, Kraft Heinz’s 
Lunchables brand matched a grant made by 
the Kraft Heinz Foundation to support Share Our Strength’s No 
Kid Hungry Campaign, by helping to provide 5 million meals for 
children in need in the U.S.

“We are incredibly grateful for our new partnership with The Kraft Heinz 
Foundation. With the continued support of committed partners like Kraft Heinz, 
No Kid Hungry is helping children all over the country get the nutritious food they 
need to succeed.”

Red Cross 

Greater Chicago Food Depository

Vision Statement: The American Red Cross, 
through its strong network of volunteers, donors and partners, is 
always there in times of need. 

Through a network of about 250 chapters in the U.S., the American 
Red Cross provides relief to victims of disaster and helps people 
prevent, prepare for and respond to emergencies. As a member 
of the organization’s Disaster Responder Program, The Kraft 
Heinz Foundation is part of a select group of forward-thinking 
organizations that provide the highest level of year-round support 
to Red Cross disaster relief and preparedness efforts. The advance 
commitment – before disaster strikes – powers the Red Cross to 
be ready to help disaster survivors at a moment’s notice, while 
also preparing people and communities for crises yet to come. 
Furthermore, in 2020, Kraft Heinz employees also donated 
personal funds to the Red Cross, which the Kraft Heinz Foundation 
then matched.

“Ongoing pre-investment from members of the Disaster Responder Program 
like The Kraft Heinz Company Foundation helps create a reliable funding base 
for disaster relief services, providing food, shelter, emotional support and other 
essential assistance. Money donated by the public and members of our Disaster 
Responder Program is essential to our ability to assist disaster survivors and 
support the first responders and volunteers who work tirelessly at the scene of a 
disaster.”

Greater Pittsburgh  
Community Food Bank

“During a time when more of our neighbors than ever before were facing so 
much uncertainty, Kraft Heinz stepped up to meet the need in an incredible 
way. Through its COVID relief support and Childhood Hunger Initiatives support, 
we were able to expand our reach in the community and ensure our neighbors 
have sufficient food to eat until they get back on their feet. On behalf of all our 
neighbors living with hunger, thank you, Kraft Heinz, for being a great neighbor 
and helping when our community needed you the most.” 

– Lisa Scales, president and CEO, Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank

“The Kraft Heinz Company, co-headquartered in Chicago, 
has proven time and again to be a strong partner in our mission of ending hunger 
here in Cook County. In the past five years, Kraft Heinz has donated the equivalent 
of more than 3.7 million meals to families in need. At the Greater Chicago Food 
Depository, Chicago’s food bank, we are so thankful for the company’s unwavering 
support in the ongoing hunger crisis”. 

– Kate Maehr, Executive Director and CEO, Greater Chicago Food Depository 

Food Banks Canada

In 2020 alone, Kraft Heinz Canada contributed 
more than 2 million pounds in food donations to food banks across 
Canada in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Canada’s 
largest food company, we are committed to reducing food 
insecurity and, in the long term, eliminating hunger. We contribute 
to the community primarily through Food Banks Canada, which 
represents about 650 food banks across the country.

Pantry Day 

On October 16, 2020, World Food Day, Kraft Heinz Canada 
launched Pantry Day, encouraging Canadians to join the fight 
against food insecurity by purchasing a participating Kraft Heinz 
product at their local grocery store, which was then matched by 
Kraft Heinz with a donation to Food Banks Canada. Kraft Heinz 
Pantry Day supports Food Banks Canada with a 5-year, $20 
million product donation that will help bring meals to the tables 
of the 4.4 million Canadians affected by food insecurity across 
the country. The scope and donation effort of Kraft Heinz Pantry 
Day makes it the largest one-day donation matching event for 
Food Banks Canada.

The Lunchbox Fund

Child Aid

Founded in 2005, the Lunchbox Fund provides impoverished 
and food insecure children aged 1 - 18 with nutrient fortified food 
daily, at school to incentivize attendance, across South Africa. 
These children would otherwise go hungry. This meal encourages 
children to attend school and enables them to concentrate and 
learn while they are there. Children are supported at all stages 
of their education – from pre-school through to primary and 
secondary school and after-school programs. In 2020, The Kraft 
Heinz Foundation supported this organization’s laudable efforts at 
feeding malnourished children in need, made even more dire by 
COVID-19 impacts.

“In 2020 Kraft Heinz committed funding that is going to support 1,260,000 hot 
meals to 6,690 children in 27 Schools in South Africa. On average Lunchbox Fund 
schools see a 30 percent increase in attendance where our meals are provided. For 
the majority of these children it is their only guaranteed meal of the day.”

In 2020, the Kraft Heinz Foundation awarded a $75,000 grant 
(approximately 579,600 meals) to support Guatemalan children 
and their families as part of Child Aid’s White Flag Hunger Relief 
Campaign. The spread of COVID-19 added additional challenges 
to a country already grappling with inflation and food insecurity 
issues. In addition, two powerful hurricanes hit the region in quick 
succession in November 2020, which further crippled a nation 
under siege. Families who normally teeter on the edge of extreme 
poverty found themselves, without immediate intervention, 
facing starvation. Through Child Aid, children and families in 
need received boxes of emergency food supplies to help them 
through these difficult times. Each box feeds a family of five or six 
people for approximately three weeks and contains one pound of 
beans, one pound of rice, one liter of oil, one pound of noodles, 
powdered milk, salt, sugar, hand sanitizer, vitamins for children, and 
one Spanish-language children’s storybook.

Heinz’s Support for U.K. Government  
Care Packages

At times of such upheaval, our concerns must always turn to those 
most in need of support. During the early days of the pandemic, 
our Heinz brand took a leading role with a U.K. Government 
sponsored program to protect the vulnerable. We helped to shield 
these individuals from the food shortages many experienced 
during the initial lockdown, by supplying some of our best loved 
canned food staples as part of the food packages delivered weekly 
to those in need. Moreover, we partnered with peer companies, 
retailers and foodservice wholesalers to plan and activate the 
initiative. In total, we supplied over 15 million cans of beans, soups 
and pasta, becoming the largest provider in the initiative.

Wattie’s and Plunket working together  
for New Zealand children

Whānau Āwhina Plunket (Plunket), founded in 1907, is a charity 
supporting services for the health and well-being of children under 
the age of 5 in New Zealand.

In 2020, Plunket and Wattie’s, celebrated an amazing milestone – a 
30-year partnership working together to support Kiwi whānau – 
the extended family of New Zealanders. In 1990, Wattie’s-Plunket 
Baby Foods was co-launched. Today, Wattie’s continues to support 
Plunket and New Zealand whānau. Along with providing funds to 
help keep Plunket’s services running, Wattie’s and Plunket also work 
together providing helpful information and resources for whānau 
about infant nutrition and starting solids, in line with the New 
Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines.

2020 was marked with a special fundraiser to support whānau and 
tamariki (children) across New Zealand. To celebrate this long-
lasting relationship, during our anniversary week in July 2020, 
Wattie’s committed to donating a baby food pouch to Plunket for 
every Stage 1 and 2 Wattie’s baby food pouch sold at Countdown 
and New World grocery stores in New Zealand. This resulted in 
approximately 50,000 pouches of baby food being donated to 
Plunket to help support whānau across New Zealand.

Standing Up  
For Social Justice

2020 was an unprecedented year. The world grappled with an ever-changing “new normal” in the wake 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of people impacted in the most dire of ways. Across the globe, 
people came together to demand justice and fight systemic inequality.

In countries where we live and work, Kraft Heinz stood up for social 
justice in many ways. For example, Kraft Heinz Canada became a 
signatory to the BlackNorth Initiative’s CEO Pledge against anti-
black systemic racism. Canada Zone President, Bruno Keller signed 
the pledge in 2020 and Kraft Heinz Canada has been working 
towards actions and commitments across the various pledge 
components, including bias interruption training, partnering with 
local organizations like the Canadian Black Chamber of Commerce, 
and outreach to Black university student organizations.

Another way Kraft Heinz supported social justice in 2020 was 
through our Kraft Heinz Foundation’s philanthropic giving. We 
committed $1 million to social justice organizations combating 
food insecurity in African American communities.  

Some of the organizations that received grants as part of this 
program are:

•   412 Food Rescue

•   Greater Chicago Food Depository

•   Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank

•   Second Harvest Heartland

•   My Block My Hood My City

•   The Brotherhood Sister Sol

•   United Negro College Fund

Second Harvest Heartland 

Minnesota Central Kitchen (MCK) is an initiative of Second  
Harvest Heartland, harnessing the power of the food bank  
to bring nutritious, prepared meals to communities facing the 
biggest meals gap. 

MCK was born in the early days of the pandemic to rescue 
abandoned food, re-employ furloughed workers, and get urgently 
needed meals to people facing hunger. Today, through a robust 
community network of more than 100 partners, they are ensuring 
ready-to-eat meals are available in communities and to families 
who need it most.

“Thanks to the support of Kraft Heinz Foundation, MCK partnered with Chef Sean 
Sherman and his Indigenous Food Lab team to provide meals to those most 
affected by COVID-19 and the social uprisings following George Floyd’s death. In 
addition, Kraft Heinz Foundation’s grant supported meals produced by Appetite 
for Change for families in North Minneapolis that had urgent food needs.” 

– Robin Manthie, Director, Minnesota Central Kitchen,  
Second Harvest Heartland

The Brotherhood Sister Sol

“Kraft Heinz has been an invaluable partner to The 
Brotherhood Sister Sol in our work to respond to the 
disparate impact of the COVID-19 crisis on low-income 
communities of color. From generous in-kind donations of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, 
as well as Thanksgiving food items for our Fall food drive, to critical financial support 
of our emergency food distribution, Kraft Heinz has been an indispensable friend to 
BroSis and our youth members. Our work in the past year - including 700,000 meals 
provided and robust support services to hundreds of young people to achieve change - 
would not be possible without Kraft Heinz.”

Global Nutrition Guidelines 

In 2018, we achieved our commitment to expand our nutrition 
guidelines globally. The Kraft Heinz regional nutrition guidelines 
for the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand were used as 
a starting point to set our Global Nutrition Guidelines. The new 
Global Nutrition Guidelines identify nutrient targets for our 
products, with a focus on limiting sugar, sodium, saturated fat and 
calories. In addition, we continue to focus on increasing positive 
nutrients and offering alternative ingredient choices. 

As part of this process, the Kraft Heinz Global Nutrition Group 
identified upper limits for calories, sodium, sugar and saturated fat 
across the 49 categories that represent our total global portfolio. 
Products that meet these nutrition guidelines align with globally 
– recognized dietary recommendations from the World Health 
Organization, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering 
and Medicine, and the European Food Safety Authority. 

For some of the key products in our portfolio that we have 
developed these guiderails for, we have been assessed by credible 
third-party professionals or engaged with objective industry 
consultants. 

In 2020, Kraft Heinz announced that we are committed to:

• Continuing to apply our Global Nutrition Targets to all of our 
products*, which include upper limits on calories, sodium, sugar 
and saturated fat. 

• Publishing our Global Nutrition Targets, which can now 

be found on our website here, and targeting changes in our 
product portfolio. 

We’re aiming for 85 percent of our products by sales weighted 
volume to be compliant with our Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs)  
by 2025.**

Through 2020 we have achieved approximately 75 percent 
compliance with our Global Nutrition Targets (GNTs). This was due 
to significant shifts in our products sales mix throughout 2020. 
However, we continue to innovate and renovate our existing 
product portfolio favorably toward our GNTs and delivering tasty 
products, as well as make progress on increased measurable data 
coverage globally, all while we continue to further standardize and 
verify our metrics with leading external benchmarks.

We aim to achieve our overall nutrition compliance target by: 

• Reducing total sugar in our products by more than 60 million 
pounds across our global portfolio based off of 2019 volumes 
by 2025. In 2020, we nominally decreased total sugar in our 
products by less than one percent of our 2025 commitment, 
and set initial roadmaps for key projects that we anticipate will 
enable us to achieve this challenging target in years to come

• Reducing sodium by an additional five percent in our BBQ 
Sauce and Kraft Salad Dressings in North America by 2025. 

• Simplifying ingredients. 

• Increasing our offerings of plant-based proteins. 

We have set up a cross-functional team to also evaluate how 
our products can be simplified by using more ingredients that 
consumers recognize and are likely to use at home in their kitchens. 
Our teams have initially focused on artificial flavors, preservatives 
and colors. More information on our progress in this space can be 
seen on page 37.

Targets by 2025.

Plant-based Proteins 

The Heinz brand has been making high quality, plant-based 
products for over 150 years, and plant proteins like beans have 
been part of this for decades.

Responding to consumers’ increasing gravitation towards 
‘flexitarian’ lifestyles, the Heinz and Wattie’s Plant Proteinz range 
was launched in March 2020 in the Australian market and followed 
with a New Zealand launch in June. Each serving contains 15g of 
plant protein and a mixture of hearty vegetables, legumes and 
beans, designed to showcase the exciting and delicious flavor 
potential that Heinz is known for.

‘Pulse of the Nation,’ a consumer study commissioned in 2019 by 
Heinz Australia, found there is increasing interest among consumers 
in reducing their meat intake. The Plant Proteinz soup range offers 
these consumers tasty plant protein-based alternatives to meat at 
an affordable price, so that everyone can make a choice and pick 
up a convenient plant-protein based meal that doesn’t compromise 
on tastiness and heartiness.

Organic 

To offer our consumers choices that help them meet their lifestyle 
and wellness goals, we have brands with organic offerings that we 
are constantly looking to expand. 

United States: In the United States, our certified organic products 
adhere to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Organic 
Program standards and regulations. Our organic certified products 
include Capri-Sun organic juices and Heinz organic ketchup. All 
agricultural products meet organic criteria and less than 5 percent 
of the total product contains allowable non-organic ingredients. 
Our Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner made with organic contains 
over 70 percent certified organic ingredients.

Canada: In Canada, our organic products comply with the 
Canadian Organic Standards as required by the Canadian Organic 
Regime (COR). Examples include our Kraft Dinner organic Original 
Macaroni & Cheese, Heinz organic tomato ketchup, Classico 
organic pasta sauces, and Heinz organic baby foods and cereals.

Europe: In Europe, we offer Heinz tomato ketchup 
with 100 percent organic tomatoes to meet the 
needs of our consumers. In the U.K., we also offer 
our delicious Heinz baked beans and cream of 
tomato soup with organically grown beans and 
tomatoes.

Continental Europe

In September of 2020, we launched Honig Pulses Pasta. This pasta is made with 50 percent pulse powder, 
durum wheat and egg albumen. The product has the bite and appearance of regular pasta, but is lower in 
carbohydrates while being a source of protein and is higher in fiber respective to the particular SKU, than regular 
pasta. It is available in three different shapes with different type of pulses: yellow lentil penne, chickpea fusilli, and 
yellow pea macaroni.

United Kingdom

In June 2020, we launched Heinz salad dressings sprays. We launched a new range of salad dressing sprays 
designed to eliminate the deluge of dressing that can occur with pours from a standard bottle, the all new smart 
spray bottle from Heinz delivers just one to two calories per serving, without losing out on great taste.

China

Throughout 2020, Kraft Heinz China had a number of product health success stories, including: 

• “No added flavor” for full Heinz infant portfolio, including cereal, noodle, fruit crush, and biscuits.

• Removal of natural flavor from Heinz fruit crush.

• Sugar removal initiatives for all Heinz Infant products, achieving sugar reduction from the whole cereal 

portfolio with an average 15 percent reduction from recipes, estimated to contribute on average 
approximately 430 tons of sugar reduction annually.

Food Safety & Quality 

Kraft Heinz is a globally trusted producer of delicious foods. We take our responsibility with respect  
to food safety and quality very seriously, and we will not compromise on it. We all want  
to have confidence with the food on our plates. 

We implement a consistent, comprehensive food safety and 
product quality management process across our global supply 
chain. Through this, Kraft Heinz strives to not just meet, but to 
exceed regulatory compliance with industry standards.

Our food safety and product quality management process has 
been designed by us for us. We utilize leading methodologies to 
ensure food is manufactured safely, complies with local regulations 
and meets or exceeds the quality standards we’ve set for our 
products. 

Compliance with our own internal food safety and product quality 
management system ensures our internal factories are also 
compliant with Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized 
certification (e.g. FSSC 22000). Many of our factories undergo third 
party audits and achieve third party certification to demonstrate 
this. In addition to complying with our internal food safety and 
product quality management system, we also monitor other 
external metrics including product recall, serious incidents and 
factory related consumer complaints.

Responsible Marketing

Kraft Heinz is committed to marketing and advertising its products in a responsible and suitable manner, 
particularly products marketed and advertised to children under the age of 12. 

Employees responsible for creating, approving or placing 
marketing materials for Kraft Heinz have primary responsibility 
for compliance with Company guidelines, and such marketing 
team members are formally trained regarding requirements and 
expectations pursuant to various marketing policies, including a 
Marketing to Kids Pledge. 

In the United States, Kraft Heinz abides by a comprehensive set 
of marketing to children standards: Children’s Food & Beverage 
Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
Act (COPPA) and Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU). 

As noted in our Pledge and CFBAI’s Core Principles, Kraft Heinz’s 
commitments relating to marketing to children include: 

• No advertising directed to children under 6 years of age; 

• Only qualified products which meet CFBAI’s uniform nutrition 

criteria may be marketed to children ages 6 to 11; 

• Guidelines apply to media (e.g. TV, internet, radio, etc.) that is 

primarily directed to children; and 

• No in-school marketing below the university level. 

Similarly, in Canada, Kraft Heinz participates in the Canadian 
Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CAI), which 
requires participants to commit that 100 percent of advertising 
directed primarily to children under the age of 12 promotes only 
products that represent healthy dietary choices, or to commit to 
not advertising directly to children under age 12. Our company 
does not advertise to children under the age of 12 in Canada as set 
out in the CAI report.

In Europe, we adhere to clear guidelines and requirements, 
including the U.K.’s OFCOM and Advertising Standards Authority, 
as well as the Netherlands Code of Conduct on Kids Marketing. 
In Australia and New Zealand, we adhere to self-regulatory 
codes including the New Zealand Children and Young People’s 
Advertising Code and the Australian Responsible Children’s 
Marketing Initiative. 

Guidelines for Marketing  
Breast Milk Substitutes

Kraft Heinz recognizes the importance of breast-milk in 
feeding infants. Kraft Heinz also recognizes the breadth 
of diversity and variety of circumstances globally that can 
predicate the need to provide formulation nourishment to 
certain individuals that would otherwise not receive it. 

The Company complies with the World Health 
Organization (WHO) International Code for Marketing of 
Breast-Milk Substitutes and subsequent relevant World 
Health Assembly (the decision-making body of WHO) 
resolutions as implemented by international legislation or 
codes of practice. 

To further demonstrate our positions and approach on 
the manufacture and marketing of breast-milk substitutes, 
Kraft Heinz has established and published its Policy on 
Breast-Milk Substitutes. We will continue to review our 
internal policy in line with the latest recommendations of 
the WHO.

Transparency & Labeling

We have a responsibility to communicate information about our products to ensure that consumers can 
feel good about what they are feeding their families. At Kraft Heinz, we’re committed to being transparent 
and helping consumers make informed food and beverage choices, whether at home or at the grocery 
store.

Front of Pack Nutrition Labeling

Health Star Rating: Australia & New Zealand 

Consumers consistently say they want more information on how 
their food is made and what it contains. To address this need, 
we are voluntarily making our nutrition information easier for 
consumers to find by providing nutrition information on the front of 
our product packaging.

Facts Up Front: U.S. 

We have widely implemented the Facts Up Front program for key 
Kraft Heinz products to help consumers plan nutritious meals for 
their family. This voluntary program was developed in the U.S. in 
2011 to increase nutrition transparency and access by displaying 
calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium on the front of each 
package. The visual informs our consumers about the nutrients in 
each product and how they fit into a balanced and healthy diet as 
part of the federal daily dietary advice.

Kraft Heinz has participated in Australia and 
New Zealand’s voluntary Health Star Rating 
front-of-pack labeling program since 2014. The 
Health Star Rating system is a government-
backed system developed in collaboration with 
public health experts, the food industry and 
consumer groups. The rating system helps consumers compare 
food options and make more informed food choices. Kraft Heinz 
continues to support and implement Health Star Ratings on a 
wide number of our packaged food products. In 2020, the Health 
Star Rating front of pack label was included on 23 percent of our 
eligible Kraft Heinz products in Australia and New Zealand.

SmartLabel®

In the U.S. and Canada, we provide product information through 
the SmartLabel website. Responding to the information needs of 
today’s consumer, the SmartLabel™ initiative enables Kraft Heinz to 
provide consumers with the detailed information they seek about 
our products. More than 3,400 Kraft Heinz products have been 
listed on smartlabel.org, with plans to add more for both the U.S. 
and Canada. See www.smartlabel.org/products to find Kraft Heinz 
products. 

Traffic Light: 
United Kingdom

Our journey toward more transparency 
involves listening to our stakeholders. By 
participating in the Traffic Light program in 
the U.K., we hope to provide consistency 
in labeling to U.K. consumers. Under the 
traffic-light system, food and drink labels 
show whether levels of sugar, salt and fat are high, medium or low 
using red, amber and green traffic light colors – and is based on 
the amount per 100g.

Nutrition & Quality

Nutrition Research and Education 

Through ongoing research partnerships with Italian researchers, additional research was published in 
2020 in the journal Nature regarding the emerging field of postbiotics. This study, entitled “Analysis of 
immune, microbiota and metabolome maturation in infants in a clinical trial of Lactobacillus paracasei 
CBA L74-fermented formula,” demonstrated that a fermented infant formula favors the maturation of 
the immune system, microbiome and metabalome. 

Bioengineering (BE) Position 

Providing our consumers and their families with quality, great-tasting, safe products in a transparent 
and socially responsible way is and will always be our highest priority. Although the safety of genetically 
modified (GM) ingredients or bioengineering (BE) has been affirmed by virtually every major scientific 
authority worldwide, we know some consumers may have questions about this technology. We respect 
their desire to know more about the foods they eat. 

We believe BE technology can help increase the food supply, keep costs affordable, and decrease the 
use of pesticides, water and overall production costs. In fact, several types of bioengineered food such 
as soy, corn and beet sugar are currently being cultivated and exported worldwide. These crops are 
used to make a wide variety of food and beverage ingredients and are not typically segregated from 
food made without BE.

We adhere to the following global principles with respect to bioengineered ingredients: 

•  We abide by all laws governing the use and/or labeling of bioengineered ingredients. 

•  In many cases, we offer options without bioengineered ingredients. 

•  We will partner with external organizations to certify our “non-BE” claims for key ingredients where 

appropriate.

COVID-19 Special Safety 
Precautions

In response to the emergence of COVID-19 in early 
2020, we immediately launched a global taskforce, 
provided enhanced benefits and implemented 
additional robust workplace safety programs and 
processes in all of our facilities. As the circumstances 
and impacts of COVID-19 evolved, we continued to

our employees, while supporting consumers and our 
communities by keeping food on shelves, and through 
our many food donation programs.

A Track Record of Safety

Safety in the Workplace 

Total Recordable Incident Rate 

Kraft Heinz is committed to providing a healthy, safe and secure 
workplace for employees, contractors and all people who visit our 
facilities. Safety Management is built into our fully integrated Kraft 
Heinz Management System (KHMS), combining best-practice 
safety principles with other operational functions in a continuous 
improvement framework. KHMS states clear expectations 
and practical steps to manage risk and avoid injuries, and 
requirements are followed in every Kraft Heinz Facility. 

Our compiled worldwide Total Recordable Incident 
Rate (TRIR) is a medical incident rate based on the 
U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration 
(OSHA) record-keeping criteria (injuries per 200,000 
hours). 2020 was a very successful year in our Worldwide Safety 
Performance, resulting in a 0.74 TRIR. Kraft Heinz is proud of 
its safety track record, having delivered year-over-year incident 
reductions since its inception. 

We track and measure implementation through internal audits, 
with results reflected in Management-by-Objectives KPIs 
and Factory Championship rankings. Due to robust site-level 
implementation, Kraft Heinz improved its safety KPIs over the last 
year, representing some of the best results among our food and 
beverage industry peers.

Stewardship

At  Kraft  Heinz,  environmental  stewardship  begins  with  our  operational 
footprint, where we actively strive to conserve water and energy, reduce 
emissions,  minimize  waste  and  make  our  packaging  sustainable.  From 
there  it  extends  to  initiatives  in  our  supply  chain  and  takes  shape  as 
collaborative projects with customers at the other end of the spectrum. 
Notwithstanding,  our  manufacturing  sites  can  consume  substantial 
amounts of resources, and are controlled by us, so we focus significant 
efforts around environmental stewardship inside of our walls.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGINTRODUCTIONHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXSustainability Goals  
in Manufacturing

Kraft Heinz is committed to reducing its operational environmental footprint.  
We have prioritized projects across our global manufacturing network in the areas of water conservation, 
energy use and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), waste reduction and packaging.

In 2020, we set new and more ambitious manufacturing targets through 2025 against a 2019 baseline.

20%  

Decrease in water use 
intensity in high-risk 
watershed areas  
(cubic meter per metric ton 
production)

15%  

Decrease in water use 
intensity across our 
manufacturing facilities  
(cubic meter per metric ton 
production)

15% 

Decrease in energy  
use intensity  
(kilowatt hour per metric ton 
production)

20%  

Decrease in waste  
intensity 
 (kilogram per metric ton 
production)

We made significant progress towards all of these goals in our first year of the journey. We reduced water use intensity by 2.8 percent 
for all sites, and by 5.2 percent in high-risk watershed areas. We also reduced the intensity of energy use by 2.2 percent, GHGs by 
3.4 percent, and waste by 6 percent.  We are now confident we have set up the proper management systems (read more about our Kraft 
Heinz Management system on page 52) and governance structure, while leveraging appropriate resources to keep us on course toward full 
achievement of our manufacturing goals by 2025.

We continue to recognize the significant environmental impacts an ever-growing world can have, and we remain steadfast to balance 
production processes that can meet global food demand with efficient operation. Through thorough assessment and strong management 
processes and routines, we see opportunities for improvement at various stages of our operations, and we will learn from external perspectives, 
as well as ourselves by continuously fostering efficiency improvements in an environment of collaboration, ownership, and innovation.

We previously set 2020 intensity targets in 
water conservation, energy use, greenhouse gas 
emissions and waste reduction, to reduce by 15 
percent per metric ton of product made against 
a 2015 baseline, that we failed to meet as we 
contended with former supply chain challenges. 
Water use decreased by 0.02 percent. Energy use 
decreased by 2.69 percent, while GHG emissions 
decreased by 8.56 percent. Our waste increased 
significantly by 12.42 percent. We recognize the 
shortcomings in our execution in these areas and 
we have both identified and learned from the gaps, 
as well as committed to substantially improve in 
these areas in part through greater accountability, 
prioritization and real-time management. Our 
more comprehensive approach is paying off with 
our new targets.

Water Use  
& Conservation

Water is fundamental to all life and business either directly or indirectly. Making high-quality products requires that we begin with 
high-quality ingredients of which fresh quality water is a key input. Kraft Heinz is committed to water stewardship in every facet of our 
business, from our quality controls to the relationships we have with our growers and suppliers. As a food and beverage company, 
having access to sufficient amounts of quality fresh water, both now and in the future, is critical to our business. Water is used in many 
areas of our value chain. It is a vital input for growing various agricultural ingredients we use in our products. We also use water as a 
direct ingredient in many of our products and as a key utility in our manufacturing, cleaning and sanitation processes. Access to high-
quality water is pivotal for us to achieve our high standards of food safety and quality. High-quality water will continue to be a vital 
component throughout our value chain.

Water Use & Conservation  (cont.) 

We also continue to work with 
partners like Nalco Water (an 
Ecolab Company), in order to help 
identify areas of opportunity in our 
manufacturing processes to optimize water use. For example, we 
were able to save approximately 5,475,000 gallons of water per 
year from improvements to our cooling systems at our Massilon, 
Iowa site. Nalco helped us identify and implement real time 
monitoring and control which allowed the plant to run the cooling 
system at significantly increased efficiencies. In 2020, through 
our partnership with Ecolab, we identified 32 projects across our 
manufacturing sites with a combined annual water savings of more 
than 94 million gallons. Once implemented, every year these 32 
projects will save the equivalent of approximately enough water 
to fill 142 Olympic-sized swimming pools (at six feet seven inches 
deep). Connected end-to-end as one continuous pool, this would 
stretch over 4.3 miles. Moreover, the water conservation projects 
ranged from water reuse, leak repair and cleaning efficiency, to 
various optimization projects, with a total annual cost reduction of 
approximately $2.6 million. 

An example of our progress on water 
stewardship is our Wagga Wagga site in 
Australia. The Wagga Wagga facility is a 
producer of canned meat products for 
domestic and export markets. The site uses 
retorts; a pressurized machine to sterilize 
food products commercially. The sterilization 
process is very water-intensive but is a 
critical step to ensure food quality and safety. Wagga Wagga 
initially operated 12 retorts throughout the facility that ranged in 
age and efficiency. In 2020, the facility removed six less water-
efficient retorts and continued production using the remaining six 
more modern retorts that contained a water recycling function. As 
a result, the project successfully reduced the site’s water intensity 
(water use per ton production) by 75 percent. As a water-stressed 
site, Wagga Wagga’s lower reliance on water results in diverting 
less water away from natural sources. 

Another great example of progress on water conservation is our 
Otradnoe facility in Russia. The facility  produces many products, 
including a wide selection of Heinz sauces for the EMEA region. 
In 2020, the facility completed a process optimization project 
where site engineers successfully removed two intermediate 
containers from a key production line, streamlining production 
and line washing procedures. As a result, each wash cycle saves 
the equivalent of enough water for approximately two months for 
the average urban Russian family’s use. Coupled with other water-
saving initiatives at the facility, we achieved an overall reduction of 
nine percent at Otradnoe compared to our 2019 baseline year. 

We recognize the significant role we can play as a 
global food manufacturer in our own operations 
and through our supply chain in being good water 
stewards. In 2020, Kraft Heinz became an official 
and proud signatory to the CEO Water Mandate. As 
we continue to assess and improve in this critical 
area to our business, and in collaboration with 
various stakeholders throughout our value chain, we 
look forward to continue to report out on our water 
stewardship initiatives and benchmarks now and in 
the future.

Instead of utilizing intermediate containers (pictured left) to hold product in between 
two stages of the production process, site engineers installed a pump that linked the 
fed product directly to the next stage, reducing water and cleaning chemical usage.

Water Risk Assessment

In early 2018, we completed a water risk assessment of our global manufacturing operations. This 
work was completed by Antea Group, a leading global sustainability consulting firm and provider of 
water resource expertise to the food and beverage sector who is also certified by CDP. The assessment 
leveraged both WRI’s (World Resources Institute) Aqueduct data and methodology along with the 
subject matter expertise of our consulting partner. We then evaluated our watershed conditions 
from a business perspective in order to validate ‘economic scarcity’ factors not fully addressed by the 
database indicators. The completed assessment resulted in identification of physical, reputational/
social and quality water risks, as well as composite scores for each area associated in our direct 
manufacturing operations. In 2020, we updated our water risk assessment again led by Antea Group. 
At the end of 2020, we owned 78 manufacturing sites globally and leased 3 sites. Of the total 81 sites 
that we operated in, we completed a watershed risk assessment of 79 sites. Water use from these 79 
sites derived from 66 percent municipal, 25 percent bore and nine percent surface.  

2020 Kraft Heinz Water Stressed Sites

After an internal expert committee evaluation, it was determined that 19 of the 79 sites 
evaluated had some degree of elevated water stress (see map to the right). In addition to our 
new water reduction targets, we have also developed a plan that focuses on these high-risk water 
areas to drive improvements and mitigate risks, and to provide updates into our risk evaluation on an 
ongoing basis. Moreover, we will evaluate any interim mitigation strategies as needed.

Energy Use  
& Conservation

Manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and 
maintaining our highest standards around safety, quality and 
sanitation, all while providing a comfortable and secure environment 
for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of 
energy. In this type of interdependent environment, we know 
many opportunities exist to reduce energy consumption through 
operational optimization. We are on a journey of continuous 
improvement to identify our opportunities in this area and capitalize on them. 

New Chiller System at our Alfaro, Spain facility. 

Reduce energy use intensity by 15% across our 
manufacturing facilities by 2025 (per metric ton of product made). 

PROGRESS

PROGRESS

ON TRACK: — 2.2%

As a leading global food and beverage company, our scale provides a unique ability to 
test concepts at various sites, learn from ourselves, prove outcomes and then implement 
successful energy savings initiatives across our business.

For instance, in 2020, our Alfaro facility in Spain successfully reduced their electricity usage by nine percent compared to 2019 by 
upgrading their chiller systems. Chillers and other cooling machinery can consume up to 20 percent of a site’s overall energy usage. 
Alfaro produces a variety of sauces and condiments, including Heinz ketchup, mayonnaise and tomato frito. These products need 
to be chilled to the correct temperature before being packaged to ensure food safety guidelines are met. In 2020, the site replaced 
its existing five-chiller system with two larger, more efficient chillers. These newer chillers save over 658 megawatt hours of energy 
each year through better regulation and automation during the chilling process. This optimizes energy use and reduces potential 
manual control inefficiencies. Moving forward, we plan to adopt this initiative across more of our global sites.

Energy Goal Progress

We aim to decrease energy use intensity by 15 percent by 2025. In 2020, we reduced 
energy use intensity by 2.2 percent as compared to our 2019 baseline.

Kraft Heinz Management SystemIn 2020, we consolidated the Kraft Heinz Management System (KHMS) program across our global manufacturing operations. These practices are based on our Company’s Values and are reflected in our daily routines. Each component of the KHMS framework has a function that drives excellence in different areas of the organization. For example, as part of the ‘Employee & Environmental Health’ and the ‘Maintenance, Reliability & Engineering’ pillars, we have developed clear procedures that focus on the management of our utilities and waste practices. These processes establish the program’s ownership and accountability matrix, define the functions that need to be engaged in the platform, along with routines, best practices, KPIs and targets. They also include detailed guidance on how to drive improvement in these areas via the implementation of what we call Good Operational Practices (GOPs). This framework is an essential part of driving progress towards our global ESG commitments in real time. Since adopting this framework, we have made significant positive progress toward our ESG commitments. Our KHMS GOPs include areas such as:•  Boiler efficiency and performance•  Management of air compressor systems•  Efficiency and operation of chillers•  Heat recovery•  LED Lighting •  Replacement of low efficiency equipment•  Assets accessibility, capacity and functional optimization•  Waste and recycling process, byproducts streams and optimization RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGINTRODUCTIONAPPENDIXHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP

Renewable Electricity

Procure majority of electricity from renewable sources by 2025.  

PROGRESS

ON TRACK

Kraft Heinz is committed to operating responsibly and doing its 
part in the critical global efforts to reduce the harmful impacts of 
climate change. A big component of that commitment is both 
reducing how much energy we consume, and thereby reducing 
the associated emissions where applicable, as well as rethinking 
our energy sources. That is why in 2020, we committed to buy 
the majority of our electricity from renewable sources by 2025. 
During 2020, we also embarked upon several energy optimization 
initiatives at our global facilities, both combining smart long-term 
investments in energy efficiency, as well as instituting best practices 
aimed at controls and real-time operations management towards 
our energy stewardship goals. 

Science-Based Goals and Greenhouse  
Gas Management

In July 2018, Kraft Heinz announced its commitment to establish 
Science Based Targets in line with the Science Based Target 
initiative’s (SBTi) 2ºC trajectory. Since that announcement, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the United Nations 
body for assessing the science related to climate change), has 
updated its mitigation recommendation to match the current 
trajectory of climate change thresholds at 1.5ºC. 

In 2019, we worked with external consultants to help measure our 
carbon footprint across our entire global value chain, in accordance 
with the current 1.5ºC mitigation efforts. We are aligning our 
targets with the SBTi and are working with partners to identify 
the best solutions to ensure we reduce our emissions accordingly 
throughout the value chain. In 2020, we underwent a robust 
assessment related to our total value chain emissions, including 
externally verifying our Scope 3 emissions. We have also renewed 
our commitment to set a Science Based Target with SBTi by 2023, 

in accordance with the most current, credible and widely accepted 
climate science standards available. In the meantime, we are not 
resting. 

For example, we are directly targeting significant reductions in our 
respective emissions through:

• Scope 1: Continuing to reduce consumption and transition 
from fossil-based fuels to renewable options (e.g. solar, 
biomass)

• Scope 2: Continuing to expand procurement of the majority of 
our electricity from renewable sources for all facilities globally 
by 2025 

• Scope 3: Strong partnership in advocacy toward initiatives that 

reduce emissions across our value chain

A considerable portion of our total carbon footprint is produced 
from our Scope 3 emissions, and more specifically originate in our 
supply chain (see graphs to the right for emissions breakdown). 
Agriculture related emissions are particularly significant and 
provide the greatest opportunity for reduction through increased 
collaboration. 

Overall, our highest impact categories in this area, in order of 
magnitude, are:

• Ingredients

• Packaging

• Upstream and downstream transportation

• Use of sold products

•  End-of-life

We will remain focused on optimizing our immediate operational 
footprint to lessen our impact on climate, while we increasingly 
investigate joint initiatives with our suppliers that ensure the highest 
quality products are produced, while being good stewards of the 
environment.

RESPONSIBLE SOURCINGINTRODUCTIONAPPENDIXHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTWaste Reduction

At Kraft Heinz, we think about waste holistically. To source, produce 
and package food and beverage products requires several inputs 
and outputs related to ingredients and byproducts, material flows 
and end-of-life package considerations. When we think about 
materials and food-related flows, detailed waste evaluations help 
us identify where we can ‘reduce, repurpose and recycle.’ In fact, 
our global owned manufacturing sites divert more than 90 percent 
of our solid waste to recycling or byproducts usage. We look 
forward to increasing diversion from landfill for the remaining less 
than 10 percent. 

As of December 31, 2020, about 10 percent of Kraft Heinz global 
manufacturing facilities had achieved zero-waste-to-landfill 
status. We’re working to achieve zero-waste at additional sites by 
standardizing, replicating and rolling out these best practices as 
broadly as possible across our network in partnership with third-
party service providers.  

We are committed to finding creative solutions to reduce waste 
bound for the landfill. Much of our organic waste or byproducts, 
for example, can be used as animal feed, fertilizer or processed 
to generate fuels. Our cardboard and plastic waste can also be 
repurposed to produce new products. For our most challenging 
waste categories, we are actively looking into developments 
around pyrolises and other innovative ways of recycling.

Reduce waste to landfill intensity by 20% across our 
manufacturing facilities by 2025 (per metric ton of product made). 

PROGRESS

ON TRACK: — 6%

For example, our Shanghai manufacturing facility found a novel 
way to divert waste from the landfill. A common byproduct of the 
wastewater treatment process at the site is a form of biological 
sludge. The facility produced approximately 250 – 300 tons of this 
sludge each year. Unfortunately, the sludge is not easily recyclable 
and comes with a high cost of disposal. The team then found a 
local earthworm-breeding company that could turn the biological 
sludge into organic fertilizer. The organic fertilizer is sold to farmers 
for usage in fruit and vegetable farms. Through this program, the 
site significantly reduced their waste to landfill while reducing 
overall waste costs by up to 40 percent.

SPOTLIGHT ON MONT ROYAL

Improved Recycling at Mont-Royal 

In 2020, our employees at our Mont-Royal manufacturing site in Canada 
helped to develop and carry out a complete overhaul of our materials 
sorting system on each of our production lines. We were able to improve 
the percentage of materials recycled and better segregate them. This led 
to a reduction of contamination that otherwise can cause recyclables to 
instead be landfilled. We achieved a 10 percent reduction year over year 
in the amount of waste sent to the landfill at Mont-Royal. Moreover, we 
have reached an 83 percent recycle rate.

Reducing Food Waste

Food waste is a global problem. Globally, 1.3 billion tons of food 
is wasted annually accounting for roughly one third of all food 
produced globally. That is approximately 2.2 trillion meals that 
could be feeding the almost 800 million hungry people around the 
world. Beyond this, food waste is detrimental to our environment, 
leading to wasted resources like energy, water and land. And as our 
population grows, the pressure on our water, land and energy to 
feed all those people will only increase.

Therefore, when we think of food waste at Kraft Heinz, we think of 
it in terms of our highest priorities. We focus on the entire value 
chain in terms of where food waste can be reduced. This includes 
sourcing, production, transportation, shelf life, use and end-of- life. 
We analyze and test how processes, products and packaging can 
be optimized. We investigate where unneeded byproducts or 
unwanted finished products can find other uses versus going to 
landfill, such as beneficial land application and product donations 
to those in need.

In 2020 amidst the global pandemic, we recognized our 
responsibility to respond during this time of need in the world 
in any way we could. We optimized our donation strategy 
and response times, and successfully increased our total food 
donations, accounting for more than 35 million meals around the 
world in 2020 to those in need. We achieved this through greater 
focus, discipline and our ownership culture that is pervasive 
throughout our employee base, which empowered employees 
to decisively and quickly act as needs arose. Moreover, key 
components of this program included: 

•  Incorporating additional accountabilities around updating 
product code date information to increase donatable life 

•  More frequently analyzing warehouse data to optimize product 

that could be diverted to donations

•  Increased engagement with our partners to find new outlets 
and ensure product is in the best form to be received for 
donation and relabeled or repackaged when necessary 

•  Working with our retail and food service customers to increase 
donations, learn best practices, and share in the mission to 
decrease food waste

Kraft Heinz has joined together with industry peers to eliminate 
food waste globally. Kraft Heinz Canada and Kraft Heinz United 
Kingdom both joined national commitments to reduce food waste. 

U.K.: In the U.K., Kraft Heinz joined the Food Waste Reduction 
Roadmap (FWRR) initiative. More than one hundred food-related 
organizations have committed to supporting this initiative, which 
aims to reduce food waste in the U.K. by 50 percent by 2030. The 
initiative is run by IGD (a food research and training organization) 
and WRAP (a nonprofit focused on sustainability) to verify data and 
encourage best practices. Kraft Heinz committed to setting a target 
for food waste reduction across our own operations towards the 
broader goal, and to also work in partnership with suppliers and 
consumers to that end. WRAP committed to report results in 2019, 
2022, 2026 and issue a final report in 2031 against the 50 percent 
reduction goal. 

Canada: In Canada, Kraft Heinz has joined seven other companies 
in a pledge to reduce food waste in operations by 50 percent by 
2025. Our collective progress towards this aggressive goal will be 
reported annually to Canada’s National Zero Waste Council and 
the Provision Coalition. Kraft Heinz will use the globally recognized 
Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard to 
report our annual progress.

In 2020, Kraft Heinz Canada also partnered with NorthStar 
Recycling on our recycling and waste diversion efforts. This initiative 
was launched mid-2020, and in just six months we successfully 
diverted approximately 3 million pounds of waste from landfill. We 
were also able to incorporate beneficial alternative uses wherever 
feasible, such as composting and animal feed.

NOVA GOIAS, BRAZIL

Getting More out of Mayo 

Our Nova Goias facility in Brazil is a key producer of Heinz and Quero 
mayonnaise for the region. In 2020, the site created a way to capture 
and divert unsaleable product to a third-party facility for beneficial reuse. 
At this facility, the mayonnaise is processed to extract the oil from its 
contents and then turned into biodiesel. Any leftover residue is also used 
to produce animal feed. As a result, the site successfully reduced waste 
by approximately nine percent year over year. In the future, we anticipate 
expanding this program to include different product lines and further divert 
waste from the landfill.

Our comprehensive approach to packaging seeks to meet 
extensive packaging regulations, aims to cut waste, conserve 
natural resources, ensure food safety and quality, and satisfy 
our consumers. Our team of experts collaborates with suppliers 
and external packaging specialists to design better packaging 
that incorporates more recycled and recyclable materials. We 
furthermore partner with a variety of leading organizations and 
coalitions to explore technical, end-of-life and infrastructure 
solutions. 

In 2018, Kraft Heinz announced a commitment to aim to make 
100 percent of our packaging globally recyclable, reusable or 
compostable by 2025. We’ve partnered with environmental 

consultancy group, Lorax EPI, to better understand how much 
of our packaging is recyclable, reusable and compostable. The 
majority of our packaging is paper-based, glass or metal materials 
that are recyclable. The other portion of our packaging is mostly 
made up of flexible plastic films or rigid plastic containers. Through 
2020, 83 percent of our global packaging portfolio was recyclable, 
reusable or compostable. We have made improvements in our 
accounting methods with our partners as we continue to pursue 
technical alternatives and more sustainable packaging across key 
areas of our portfolio.

Better Packaging 

We consider the appearance, functionality, cost and environmental impact of packaging design, focusing on 
product integrity through production, distribution, shelf life and end-of-life. 

In 2020, we launched a Maxwell House 100 percent compostable coffee pod in Canada. Made from plant-based 
materials, all pod components and its inner bag are 100 percent compostable, plus the outer carton is 100 percent 
recyclable. The compostable coffee pods are made up of 85 percent coffee grounds with a paper lid, a coffee 
filter made from cornstarch and a plant-based compostable ring made from over 20 percent coffee bean husks. 
Certified by the Biodegradable Products Institute, this designation verifies that the compostable coffee pod meets 
global scientific standards for industrial compostability and is formulated to break down in a period of about seven 
weeks. So it’s really Good to the Last Drop.

In New Zealand, we were able to reduce material inputs across a selection of our pouch packaging through 
downgauging, or thinning of our packaging. This resulted in 28 tons of material savings per year. That’s the 
equivalent of enough compacted trash to be picked up from roughly 2,400 average-sized homes in New Zealand.

In 2020, we began a partnership with Loop, a waste-free online shop, that allows consumers to responsibly buy 
products in refillable packaging which is collected, cleaned and refilled after use. We launched a special Heinz 
tomato ketchup bottle adorned with the Loop logo to select U.K. 
customers. Heinz sells approximately 650 million bottles of tomato 
ketchup around the world every year and this partnership marks 
a significant step forward towards our sustainable packaging 
commitments. We plan to expand this collaboration to cover 
more products and regions in the coming years.

Kraft Heinz values all life. We have a zero-tolerance approach to human rights violations across our 
entire value chain. As we look at our business, we know human rights are an essential part of being  
a good corporate citizen and doing the right thing. 

In 2019, Kraft Heinz released a new Global Human Rights Policy, 
which is guided by internationally recognized standards, including 
the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights, the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles 
set forth in the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 

As part of the Global Human Rights Policy, Kraft Heinz requires all 
employees and related entities, suppliers and business partners to 
strictly adhere to our human rights standards, which, in summary: 

• Prohibit child and underage employment 

• Prohibit trafficking, forced or involuntary prison labor 

• Prohibit all and any forms of abuse, bribery, harassment and 

discrimination 

• Recognize and respect the rights of freedom of association 

and collective bargaining 

• Recognize and respect fair, legal and equitable work 

timeframes, working conditions (including health and safety) 
and wages 

• Recognize land rights, natural resources and ensure all 
workers’ rights to clean water and adequate sanitation 
facilities 

• Require all labor recruitment and employment procedures to 

be carried out in a legal and ethical manner 

Following the release of the Global Human Rights Policy, Kraft 
Heinz undertook a global human rights risk assessment with third-
party assistance. This exercise highlighted relative risk factors 
by commodity type overlaid with associated geographical risk. 
The evaluation also included economic and social criteria to 
determine points in our value chain where risk is highest, and 
where we could make the greatest impact. The scope of the 
assessment was all encompassing – rather than only evaluating 
specific commodities, we assessed nearly all of our ingredient food 
purchases. This assessment is influencing our plans to continuously 
develop and improve our due diligence and management 
programs. In 2020, we began plans of our two-prong approach, 
working collaboratively with our value chain toward proactive 
capacity building, identifying areas where we can collectively 
make improvements, as well as targeting specific elevated-risk 
procurement categories, with enforcement actions if necessary and 
segmentation based on:

• Type of supplier (Strategic, Core or Transactional)

• Risk categories and materiality

• Risk levels based on country pairings across procurement units

Kraft Heinz is committed to addressing any adverse human rights 
impacts within its supply chain. We require our suppliers, business 
partners and other relevant stakeholders to likewise adhere to any 
improvements as necessary. We also continue to take steps to 
strengthen our third party audit programs to ensure compliance 
with our Global Human Rights Policy, as well as with other Kraft 
Heinz ESG policies, such as our Supplier Guiding Principles. We will 
report the results of our audit program to our Executive Leadership 
Team on a regular cadence.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGSustainably Sourced Palm Oil

Kraft Heinz recognizes that unsustainable palm oil production 
is one of the largest drivers of deforestation globally, and as an 
organization we have taken active steps to address these issues in 
our supply chain. We (including through legacy Heinz prior to 2015) 
have been a proud member of the Roundtable on Sustainable 
Palm Oil (RSPO) since 2007, a multi-stakeholder nonprofit aimed 
at uniting all aspects of the palm industry to minimize the negative 
impact of palm oil cultivation. In 2017, Kraft Heinz became a 
founding member of The North American Sustainable Palm 
Oil Network (NASPON). NASPON is an independent group 
of associations, civil society organizations, consumer goods 
manufacturers, retailers, and palm oil traders and producers, who 
are committed to increasing the use of certified sustainable palm 
oil (CSPO) in North America to 100 percent. NASPON works 
collaboratively to find industry-wide solutions to secure certified 
sustainable palm oil in our products while adhering to human 
rights and labor laws, and while respecting local communities and 
biodiversity throughout the palm oil supply chain. 

In 2017, Kraft Heinz in partnership with The Rainforest Alliance 
carried out an initial deforestation baseline risk assessment of our 
global (tier 1) direct supply chain and guide the development of 
our Global Sustainable Palm Oil Policy. The implemented Policy 
incorporates environmental and social principles and highlights 
Kraft Heinz’s commitment to sourcing palm oil that is 100 percent 
certified sustainable and traceable to the mill. 

The baseline risk assessment of our direct global palm oil supply 
chain allowed us to identify potential deforestation risks, as well 
as peatland/biodiversity hotspot encroachment concerns. Direct 
suppliers were asked to provide information on the country of 
origin of their palm raw materials, as well as their sustainable/ 
responsible sourcing policies. Details on their sustainable palm 

oil objectives were also shared, as well as their progress on those 
targets. Suppliers were also asked to provide traceability data for all 
palm oil mills in their supply chain. The mills’ geographical location 
in conjunction with a global satellite mapping tool incorporated 
potential deforestation and other environmentally related risks 
in the mill sourcing regions. The information obtained from 
this exercise allowed us to engage our suppliers to discuss any 
identified risks and develop action plans to manage them.

2007: H.J. Heinz Holdings Corporation becomes a member of the 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. 

2014: Kraft Foods Group, Inc. becomes a member of the 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. 

2015: Kraft Heinz becomes a member of the Roundtable on 
Sustainable Palm Oil. 

2018: Kraft Heinz worked with The Rainforest Alliance to expand 
the scope of our deforestation risk assessment to include global 
external manufacturing partners. 

2019: Kraft Heinz initiates corrective action phase, engaging direct 
suppliers to address identified risks in their supply chains. 

In 2020, we continued to evaluate our supply chain to assess our 
direct suppliers and evaluate their sustainable palm oil policies, 
track their progress towards 100 percent traceability to the mill and 
make sure that they maintain RSPO certification for the products 
we purchase from them. Moving forward, Kraft Heinz will continue 
to engage with direct suppliers, external manufacturers, and 
indirect suppliers to advance our sustainable and traceable palm oil 
supply. We look forward to educating all of our stakeholders on our 
policy and expectations, maintaining accountability, and increasing 
transparency.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGSustainable Soy Sourcing

In partnership with The Rainforest Alliance, in 2019 Kraft Heinz 
expanded its forest risk commodities supply chain assessment 
to include soy. The first phase of this work focused on our global 
direct soy-based ingredient suppliers, with the purpose of carrying 
out a baseline evaluation to understand their sustainable soy 
sourcing policies and commitments. As part of that process, we 
evaluated any existing sustainable product certifications and 
sourcing risks based on countries of origin. We also established 
greater visibility to their overall chain of custody. 

Based on results obtained from our direct global suppliers that 
completed the survey, we learned the following about our global 
soy volume, approximately:

• 47 percent is sourced from low-risk countries of origin in regard 

to environmental and social risk

• 5 percent sourced from potential medium-risk countries of 

origin

• 38 percent sourced from potential high-risk countries of origin

Additionally, 49 percent of the suppliers that participated in the 
exercise reported having a sustainable sourcing policy in place 
while 33 percent of the suppliers that indicated they do not have a 
policy in place, communicated they could develop and implement 
a policy in the future. This initial assessment helped us gain visibility 
into and increased transparency of a considerable portion of our 
global soy supply chain. Further engagement is needed in our soy 
value chain to investigate potential risks. The assessment produced 
a number of key recommendations that we are in the process of 
evaluating to help determine next steps.

In 2022, we plan to conduct a broader risk assessment of our 
ingredients and agricultural commodities with deforestation as a 
criteria. We expect to provide updates on our findings in future 
reports.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGA Culture of Animal Welfare

Kraft Heinz believes that animals deserve a good quality of life and to 
be treated humanely. We have an unwavering commitment to the care 
of animals in our supply chain. Although we neither own nor manage 
farms, we align with our suppliers in requiring their animals be treated 
with care, understanding and respect. 

Kraft Heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements 
which guide our animal welfare policies and initiatives: 

• Health and Productivity: healthy animals that are provided with 

quality shelter, feed, and water 

• Emotional Well-Being: negative experiences minimized and 

positive experiences enhanced 

• Naturalness: animals perform important species-specific behaviors 

This concept of animal welfare builds upon the internationally 
recognized “Five Freedoms” of animal welfare which include the 
fundamental principles of 1) freedom from hunger and thirst, 2) 
freedom from physical and thermal discomfort, 3) freedom from pain, 
injury or disease, 4) freedom to express normal behaviors, and 5) 
freedom from fear and distress. 

We support housing designs that support an animal’s ability to perform 
species-specific behaviors. Examples include, but are not limited to, 
cage-free housing with perches and nest boxes for laying hens and 
group housing for gestating sows.

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIPHEALTHY LIVING & COMMUNITY SUPPORTAPPENDIXINTRODUCTIONRESPONSIBLE SOURCINGOur Supply Partners

Our suppliers are our partners in humane animal care and its 
continuous improvement. We expect suppliers to maintain strict 
standards of animal care and raise animals in accordance with the 
laws and ordinances in their locale. We require our suppliers to 
have a zero-tolerance policy for animal abuse and neglect, and to 
train all individuals working with or around live animals. In addition 
to the Global Animal Welfare Policy, animal welfare expectations 
are delineated in the Kraft Heinz Ingredient Supplier Quality 
Expectations Manual and product specifications. When evidence of 
non-compliance exists, Kraft Heinz may suspend the supplier 
until corrective actions have been implemented. Suppliers 
who do not align with the requirements or do not 
make continuous and positive improvements to 
meet them risk losing Kraft Heinz as a customer.

A Culture of Animal Welfare  (cont.) 

When painful procedures need to be performed, we encourage 
pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. Kraft 
Heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue 
continuous improvement consistent with the Five Freedoms and 
good animal welfare. 

Kraft Heinz believes animals deserve to be treated humanely. 
Public interest in farming and animal care is continually increasing 
and consumers desire farming practices that match their values and 
expectations. Good animal welfare, environmental sustainability, 
and healthy people form an interconnected system, and well-
managed farms reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food 
supply. Knowing this, we integrate science and societal ethics in 
our animal welfare decisions. Kraft Heinz is transparent about our 
supply practices and progress. These are disclosed via our Global 
Animal Welfare Policy, website and through our ESG reports. 

Our Animal Welfare Policy applies to the entire global company 
and all its business units that use animals or animal products. A 
global steering group monitors compliance to this policy and 
reviews it biennially to ensure it remains consistent with current 
science, best production practices, and societal values.

Our Expert Committees 

In 2019, we established an advisory committee composed of 
livestock, poultry, aquaculture, and fisheries welfare experts. This 
committee provides guidance on science and best practices, 
animal welfare assessment, and emerging topics in animal welfare. 
In 2020, our advisory committee helped guide Kraft Heinz across 
these areas for immediate efficacy as well as for future planning. 
Our animal welfare specialist provides training on farm animal 
production and welfare to cross-functional team members within 
the company. Our animal welfare specialist also leads our ESG 
Steering Group Subcommittee on Animal Welfare, as well as 
conducts quarterly meetings with an expanded multi-disciplined 
team. Together, these various committees join into what is a 
powerful system supporting sound practices and implementation 
of our animal welfare objectives. For example, in 2020, we laid 
the groundwork for improvements to our animal welfare policies. 
Externally, our specialist serves on the animal welfare committees 
of the North American Meat Institute and the National Turkey 
Federation.

Laying Hens 

The ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting, 
and dust-bathing is important to laying hen welfare, which is why we 
support housing options such as cage-free housing with perches and 
nest boxes. In Europe, we achieved our commitment to exclusively 
purchase free-range eggs by the end of 2020. This represented a 
significant improvement year over year and was the result of many 
hard-working Kraft Heinz team members’ dedication to good animal 
welfare, business investment and alignment with our values as a good 
corporate citizen. Throughout the rest of the world, we are transitioning 
to purchasing only cage-free eggs or better (e.g., free-range) by 
2025. Having achieved our free-range egg commitment in Europe, 
we have now updated our reporting to grouping cage-free or better 
farm systems together in one universal metric, which we feel reflects 
a more comprehensive picture of the level of animal welfare we strive 
to achieve. Globally, our supply of eggs and products was 66 percent 
cage-free or better in 2020. For more details on our regional egg data, 
please see page 74.

Pigs 

In accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe 
that pregnant sows should be safely housed in social groups with 
enough space to perform normal behaviors. The industry faces 
challenges to meet the demand, especially for pork that complies with 
strict regional legislation. Kraft Heinz is working with our pork suppliers 
to transition pregnant sows from conventional gestation stall housing 
to alternative gestation housing. In 2020, 19 percent of our global and 
100 percent of our European pork supply came from sows housed in 
alternative gestation systems. 

Broiler Chickens 
We have committed to improving broiler welfare by 2024. We 
continue to incorporate leading science into our assessment of broiler 
welfare, while we engage with the industry at-large as it redefines 
its guidelines for enhanced broiler welfare. We will incorporate a 
combination of outcome-based and practice-based metrics that 
are shown to demonstrably increase animal welfare. Targets include 
stocking density, litter quality, enrichment provision, and controlled 
atmosphere stunning and will incorporate supplier verification, such 
as auditing. We continue to engage with our United States supply 
partners in meeting enhanced broiler chicken welfare standards. 

European Chicken Commitment 
In late 2019, Kraft Heinz expanded its animal welfare 
commitments to improving chicken welfare by 2026 as part of the 
European Chicken Commitment. Kraft Heinz continues to assess and 
work to transition its European supply chain accordingly. Though this 
commitment faces some challenges related to supply for example, 
we remain steadfast in our commitment to require 100 percent of the 
fresh, frozen and processed chicken in our European supply chain to 
meet this standard. We look forward to continued engagement with 
our suppliers toward this objective.

Antimicrobials
Disease prevention strategies such as husbandry, hygiene, and 
vaccinations must be the primary defenses against animal disease. 
However, even with excellent care, farm animals sometimes become ill. 
When this occurs, antimicrobial treatment (including antibiotics) can be an 
important component of humane animal care. Therapeutic antimicrobials 
should only be used after careful review by a veterinarian and treatment 
limited to ill and at-risk animals, treating the fewest animals possible. 
Alongside good farm management, responsible antimicrobial use can help 
enhance food quality and safety.

Dairy Cattle
North America: We require our U.S. suppliers to follow the 

National Milk Producers Federation’s Farmers Assuring Responsible 
Management (FARM) Animal Care guidelines. This program 
establishes best on-farm animal management practices and includes 
second-party evaluations and third-party verification. Most of our dairy 
supply comes from U.S. farms. Our Canadian suppliers follow the 
National Farm Animal Care Council’s Code of Practice for the Care and 
Handling of Dairy Cattle. Third-party audits are required to ensure that 
the U.S. and Canadian programs’ guidelines are followed.

Eliminate Painful Procedures
We are working with farmers and the industry to develop and adopt 
practical alternatives that eliminate painful procedures. When painful 
procedures need to be performed, we encourage pain mitigation, 
such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. We expect our suppliers to 
adhere to industry guidelines, which were developed to provide safe, 
quality products while keeping both animals and humans safe.

Humane Endings
We believe animals should be provided a respectful and humane 
death. Compromised animals must be euthanized in a timely manner 
that aligns with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) 
or World Organisation for Animal Health’s (OIE) guidelines. Similarly, 
slaughter should also align with these guidelines. Efficient stunning 
prior to slaughter is important for animal welfare. One hundred percent 
of our U.S. Oscar Mayer product suppliers report that they comply with 
our product specifications which require an annual third-party humane 
slaughter audit and weekly internal animal welfare audits.

In the United States, where the majority of Kraft Heinz meat ingredients 
are purchased, we require our suppliers to meet or exceed the AVMA or 
OIE guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. Our meat and 
dairy products meet or exceed government regulations related to the use 
and administration of antimicrobials, including compliance with bans on 
antibiotics for growth promotion.

Hormones
While studies conclude hormone supplements in cattle are safe for 
animals and for humans, we support ongoing research efforts to further 
demonstrate the safety and usefulness of supplemental hormones. For 
example, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) is a hormone that can 
increase milk production in dairy cattle. Globally its usage varies widely 
in accordance with government regulations. In the United States for 
example, hormones (including rbST) are not allowed to be used for growth 
promotion in pigs or poultry for example. In some countries, growth 
hormones are approved for use in beef and dairy cattle. We do not restrict 
their use in those instances. However, we support wider, industry initiatives 
to eliminate rbST from the supply.

Testing of Food Ingredients
Kraft Heinz does not support or condone the use of animals for research 
that is not essential to food safety, and we do not maintain any testing 
facilities. When required by governmental agencies, ingredient safety 
testing is completed by accredited third-party facilities following 
appropriate animal welfare guidelines. We do not support unnecessary 
testing and are advocates for replacing animal testing with other validated 
research methods.

Animal Welfare Risk Assessments

Annually, all U.S.-based Kraft Heinz suppliers of animal and animal-derived products are required to complete an animal welfare risk assessment. The assessment was 
developed by a cross-functional internal panel that included animal welfare, procurement and quality team members and was reviewed by an external team of animal 
welfare scientists. The assessments review suppliers’ strengths and weaknesses on animal welfare policies, personnel training, transportation, stunning methods and 
auditing. Kraft Heinz’s animal welfare team works with lower performing suppliers, which make up a small percentage of our total supply chain. Together, they create 
action plans to develop policies and procedures that improve animal welfare. Low performing suppliers unwilling or unable to improve animal welfare may jeopardize 
their status as Kraft Heinz suppliers. In 2020, we expanded assessment requirements to all suppliers globally for the first time.

PROGRESS

At Kraft Heinz, sustainable agriculture has been a history of working with growers to drive rotational crops to promote multigenerational 
fields, increase yield at the field and in processing, drive next generation breeding through our seed business and find ways to help 
increase water efficiency. 

Through thorough research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, we strive to stay at the forefront of 
sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn to additional parts of our business.

The Kraft Heinz Sustainable Agriculture Practices guides our engagement strategy with our 
growers through 2025. We aim to dig deep in our roots to use 150 years of forward-looking, 
responsible agricultural and human rights practices to build on our agricultural legacy 
with our farmers. We are committed to bringing forward our sustainability heritage, as 
Henry J. Heinz (founder of the H.J. Heinz Company) famously noted, “Protect the 
consumer by owning the product all the way from the soil to the table.” 

We are excited to begin reworking this program and commit to sharing our

Sustainable farming practices do more than save important natural 
resources. They also have the potential to considerably increase 
crop yields and provide growers and their families with greater 
economic opportunity. Kraft Heinz has taken significant steps to 
strengthen its supply chain by evolving its Sustainable Agriculture 
Practices Manual (SAP) and working in partnership with growers to 
implement those practices. 

In 2020, we made progress toward the relaunch of our SAP 
program. The first step was revising the manual, which is divided 
into seven sections:

Feeding our Soil

The shift towards a sustainable agricultural system is not always 
easy. While beneficial in the long run, many of these practices 
present a considerable risk for a farmer as it can take years to reach 
a return on investment, which is not always guaranteed. At Kraft 
Heinz, we truly believe in working together with our partners and 
encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices in a way that’s 
equally beneficial to both the farmer and the planet. 

In 2017, Kraft Heinz’s Agricultural Research Team, including 
Ruben Garcia, Luis Venegas and Samuel Cardona noticed that 
yields on our tomato research farm in California were declining, 
and soil pathogens were on the rise. Standard tomato cultivation 
works on a three-year cycle, with crops grown and harvested 
in year one and left fallow with any remaining plant residues 
for the next two years. Ruben noted that this practice created 
an impermeable, compacted upper layer of soil that increased 
erosion and decreased overall soil health, leading to poorer yields 
and increased susceptibility to disease. His team then devised 
a strategy to improve soil health by incorporating a forage-mix 
cover crop (including oats, barley, wheat and other grasses) during 
fallow years. The cover crops would be planted during the regular 
growing season and, instead of harvested, plant matter would be 
incorporated back into the soil. The team also included a practice 
known as deep ripping, whereby any compacted soil is broken up 
mechanically to allow for better water infiltration. 

Ruben and his team demonstrated that this 
strategy protected the soil from erosion, 
increased soil organic matter by approximately 
fifty percent (see graph below) and significantly 
reduced the growth of targeted weeds. In 
addition, the team was able to show that this 
practice paid for itself multiple times over from the 
increase in yields and decrease of agricultural inputs 
such as fertilizer and herbicides. 

Practices like this can be challenging for farmers to adopt 
as they may not see any return on their investment for many 
years. However, our growing partners have begun to adopt these 
practices because of the knowledge shared by the Kraft Heinz team. 

“I’m proud of the work that my team has done to demonstrate the 
value of sustainable initiatives to our suppliers and partners. We all 
know how important it is to feed ourselves and our animals, but in this 
case, we’re feeding our soil – and that’s just as important if you ask 
me.” Samuel Cardona, Kraft Heinz Agricultural Research Team. 

Soil Organic Matter Levels at Research Farm

Over the course of four years, soil organic matter increased approximately 
50 percent with the inclusion of sustainable practices such as deep ripping 
and cover cropping.
