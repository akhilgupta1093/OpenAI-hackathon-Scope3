Direct economic value generated and distributed

Form 10-K > Ford Motor Company and Subsidiaries Financial Statements, pages 106–108

Our income statement classifies our company excluding Ford Credit total costs and expenses into two categories: (i) cost of sales, and (ii) selling, administrative and other expenses. We include 
within cost of sales those costs related to the development, production and distribution of our vehicles, parts, accessories and services. Specifically, we include in cost of sales each of the following: 
material costs (including commodity costs); freight costs; warranty, including product recall costs; labor and other costs related to the development and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories 
and services; depreciation and amortization; and other associated costs. We include within selling, administrative and other expenses labor and other costs not directly related to the development 
and production of our vehicles, parts, accessories and services, including such expenses as advertising and sales promotion costs.

Information related to payments to providers of capital is referenced as “interest expense on Automotive debt” and “cash dividends” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cash paid for interest was $1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.9 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, on Company excluding Ford Credit debt. Cash paid for interest was $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion, and 
$2.8 billion in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, on Ford Credit debt.

For our retirees, we have two principal qualified defined benefit retirement plans in the United States. The Ford-UAW Retirement Plan covers hourly employees represented by the UAW, and the 
General Retirement Plan covers substantially all other Ford employees in the United States hired on or before December 31, 2003. We established, effective January 1, 2004, a defined contribution 
plan generally covering new salaried U.S. employees hired on or after that date. Other U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries have separate plans that generally provide similar types of benefits. We report 
on contributions to, and the funded status of, our pension plans in our Form 10-K.

Financial assistance received from government

We receive grants, tax incentives and low- or no-interest loans from many countries and subdivisions of countries.

Financially material assistance from governments is typically reported in our annual Form 10-K filing. We do not currently track centrally all of the types of potential government assistance listed in 
this indicator. No government is a material shareholder in the company.

Energy consumption outside of the organization

Based on preliminary data, we estimate 3.51 Exajoules (EJ) will be consumed by Ford vehicles sold in 2021 over their lifetime. The calculation methodology has been updated for the 2021 data year 
to capture on-road well-to-wheels (WTW) energy use (for the 2020 data year we reported test-cycle WTW energy). Recalculating the 2019 and 2020 use of sold products on-road WTW energy 
use gives 5.22 and 4.07 EJ, respectively, to be consistent with this 2021 on-road data value. The decreases in 2020 and 2021 are primarily due to reduced vehicle sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
2021 data are preliminary estimates. 

METHODOLOGY: Scope 3 “use of sold products” (vehicles) is Ford’s largest source of energy use and CO2 emissions (85%, ref. CDP2021). The on-road WTW energy metric calculation is consistent 
with the GHG Protocol methodology used in calculating CO2 emissions for our SBTi targets. This calculation assumes is based on WTW lifetime energy use of all passenger cars, other light-duty 
vehicles, and commercial vehicles (medium- and heavy-duty) sold during the reporting year in the United States, EU-27, UK, China, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and 
India, representing ~88 percent of vehicles sold. 

The tank-to-wheels (TTW) energy consumed in vehicle operation is calculated from the regional government regulatory reporting data. For internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, fleet average 
gCO2/km is divided by the fuel property gCO2/MJ fuel burned (refs. U.S. GREET2019 model, Argonne National Laboratories; EU JEC Well-To-Wheels Report version 4.a, 2014), giving MJ/km. For electric 
vehicles, the fleet average energy efficiency Wh/km is converted to the same units, MJ/km. Multiplying by 241,000 km (150,000 miles) gives the lifetime TTW MJ energy consumed. For the well-to-
tank (WTT) energy, we calculate the energy expended to produce the fuels consumed by the ICE vehicles by multiplying the TTW MJ by fuel production factors (MJ expended per MJ fuel produced) 
(refs. U.S. GREET2019 model; EU JEC WTW Report version 4.a). The TTW and WTT energy are converted from the regulatory test value to on-road by 1) normalizing regional test cycles to WLTP (ref. 
ICCT, Development Of Test Cycle Conversion Factors Among Worldwide Light-Duty Vehicle CO2 Emission Standards, 2014) and 2) adding an uplift of 10% from WLTP to on-road (ref. SBTi, Transport 
Science-Based Target-Setting Guidance, 2018). The TTW and WTT MJ of energy are summed to give the total on-road lifetime WTW energy to be consumed.

Management of water discharge-related impacts

Ford’s discharges are subject to many regulatory requirements, therefore we measure and monitor standard effluent parameters and report to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required. 
Frequency of monitoring and parameters monitored vary by facility depending on discharge permits, ranging from batch to weekly to annual to continuous.

Commonly measured parameters are TSD and zinc, and methods are lab analysis or in-line measurement.

Ford does not separately calculate consumption at each facility on an ongoing basis. This decision is continually reassessed via the water assessments performed each year. Consumption data 
is obtained from water assessments performed at select Ford facilities. As of 2019, a third party has conducted water assessments at 80% of all Ford facilities. These assessments indicate that 
consumption associated with water incorporated into the product is not material.

Significant impacts of activities, products, and services on biodiversity

Necessary information cannot be obtained. The processes we have in place do not collect this data, and we have no current plans to collect it in the future.

Ford’s most significant impacts on land use and biodiversity are indirect and related to the effects of auto travel generally, including road building, urban/suburban sprawl and associated changes to 
habitats and ecosystems. Ford does not consider direct impacts of its own operations on biodiversity to be a material issue.

Remediation
Ringwood Mines Landfill Site

Ford Motor Company continues to work cooperatively with the Borough of Ringwood, the U.S. EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to address concerns raised in 
connection with Ford’s prior disposal activities in Ringwood, New Jersey.

In the fall of 2014, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) for the three soil areas requiring remediation. The parties negotiated a proposed Consent Decree for the soil remedy in 2019, which was 
lodged final by the Court in August 2020. It is anticipated that remedy construction will begin in 2021. Ford submitted the Sitewide Groundwater Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) to the EPA in October 
2018. The EPA reviewed the remedial options presented in the FFS and issued a proposed clean-up plan in January 2020. The EPA later issued the groundwater ROD in September 2020. Ford 
anticipates negotiating a proposed Consent Order with the EPA in 2021 for the performance of a groundwater remedial design.

Livonia Transmission Plant
Ford Motor Company is continuing to address groundwater impacts east of the Livonia Transmission Plant in Michigan. A groundwater treatment system was installed on-site in March 2017 and 
continues to prevent migration of groundwater impacts. Ford and the State of Michigan entered into a Consent Decree in July 2017 to continue investigation and remediation actions. Investigation 
and corrective actions are ongoing, both on-site and at off-site properties. Area residents are connected to the City of Livonia’s water source and there is no impact to drinking water.

Parental leave

Salaried U.S. employees as of December 31, 2021 who are eligible for eight weeks of new parent days: 31,577 (women: 8,705; men: 22,830).

Gender and age data are unavailable by region and not consistently tracked today. This would require the establishment of global definitions and each region would need to complete its own analysis.

For global gender data, see our Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index Survey. Age and gender turnover data is confidential information.

All U.S. salaried employees are eligible for parental leave benefits.

Employees using New Parent Days in the United States are on active payroll. To maximize flexibility, each new parent schedules the eight weeks of paid leave directly with their supervisor. The process 
relies on an honor system rather than employees having to formally code or track their time off, which means that we do not have aggregated data at the corporate level. We believe that this process is 
beneficial for employees due to the greater flexibility it provides.

Minimum notice periods regarding operational changes

Ford fully complies with applicable national and/or local legal requirements for minimum notice periods regarding significant operational changes. The vast majority of Ford’s global hourly workforce 
is covered by collective bargaining agreements. However, in most cases, minimum notice periods and provisions for negotiation/consultation of significant operational changes are not specified in 
such agreements. Rather, communication of such changes generally occurs as part of the ongoing engagement between the company and employee representatives.

For example, in the United States, the company utilizes a weekly reporting process that provides the UAW with three-week advance notice of any planned “indefinite layoff” actions and two-week 
advance notice of any planned “temporary layoff” actions. In addition, the UAW–Ford collective bargaining agreement includes a provision for a joint monthly meeting (NJSOESC), which provides 
a forum to review such actions.

Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation

Ford’s internal hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation processes are required when on-site. The company works with internal documents that detail the health and safety 
requirements that must be followed by contractors and all personnel when on-site at Ford majority-owned facilities.

For all work performed by contractors, a Pre-Task Analysis (PTA) that identifies the hazards for the work and mitigation of those hazards must be completed. The PTAs are reviewed and monitored 
by Ford.

Contractors are instructed to report any job hazards to their supervisor for resolution. If the hazard relates to Ford-owned equipment or facilities, then they are instructed to notify their Ford representative.

403-3

Occupational health services

The identification and elimination of hazards and the minimization of risks are managed through the OSHA.

Postings throughout the plants state that employees must report a work-related injury or illness to the medical department. Non-Ford employees will be given first aid treatment and their respective 
agency notified of the injury. The agency will direct its employee to the proper facility for medical treatment.

Worker training on occupational health and safety

Ford has an extensive training catalog that includes training every employee must receive prior to starting work, as well as program-specific training based on their job assignment. Each region and 
facility has a training matrix that details what training is required for each person. The required training will vary based on the work they perform and the location.

For non-occupational services, consultation is provided for employees who seek advice, but the employee is referred to their personal medical doctor (PMD) for the treatment of non-occupational 
conditions (unless temporary care is required to relieve an emergency condition). Ford medical staff do not treat non-occupational medical conditions except in an emergency. Salaried employees 
have access to programs offered through the Ford Benefits Department, including Castlight – a personalized program focused on health promotion.

Hourly employees have access to employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) programs that include weight management and smoking cessation. Both hourly and salaried employees have access to 
Quarterly Wellness Programs that include blood pressure evaluations/monitoring, lipid profile and glucose monitoring.

Ford’s internal hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation processes are ongoing and required at all times. Requirements pertain to contractors and all personnel on Ford 
majority-owned facilities, including PTAs identifying work hazards and mitigation, in case of occurrence. All PTAs are monitored by Ford. Contractors are instructed to report any job hazards to their 
supervisor and Ford representative.

Ford has a strong health and safety training program for its employees. When employees are on-site at non-majority-owned facilities and joint ventures, they are required to adhere to the facilities’ 
requirements.

We conduct Sustainability Self-Assessment Questionnaires (SAQs) with our production suppliers. The SAQ is aligned with the Supplier Code of Conduct and suppliers are assessed through third 
party audits. 

403-8

Workers covered by an occupational health and safety 
management system

U.S. locations are governed by OSHA and the requirements established in the Code of Federal Regulations (Standards – 29 CFR), General Industry (Part 1910) and Construction (Part 1926). 
Additionally, ISO standards and select nationally recognized standards organizations such as the NFPA, ANSI and ASME form part of our compliance requirements.

Internally, we have a structure of health and safety standards that align requirements established from OSHA, other applicable global regulations and applicable industry standards. The structure 
of the Safety Operating System (SOS) is based on these requirements.

The scope of the SOS is Ford’s majority-owned facilities. Joint ventures are encouraged to adopt Ford standards.

We do not track the number or percentage of employees and contractors that are covered by the SOS. We do require that all of our majority-owned manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations 
adhere to the SOS. The SOS does not apply to employees located in our administration or office buildings. These employees and buildings are covered by a different set of internal safety requirements.

Operations and suppliers in which the right to freedom of association 
and collective bargaining may be at risk

Assessment of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining is included in Ford’s audit processes and is part of our risk management. Our annual risk analysis has identified a list of 
22 high-priority countries which pose the highest risk as evaluated through our human rights indicators. In 2021, we identified non-conformances associated with freedom of association at 17% of 
production suppliers audited, out of a total of 24 assessments. Freedom of association non-conformances accounted for 4% of labor non-conformances and 1% of total audit non-conformances. 
This data is not broken down by region due to a limited sample size in some regions. When severe issues were identified, we worked with the supplier to immediately mitigate the risk and develop 
corrective action plans to address the issues according to an established timeline.

Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labor

We audit the suppliers that have been assessed as the most at risk of human rights violations based on our annual risk assessment process. Due to the size and reach of our global supply base, 
we focus our efforts on suppliers located in countries that pose the highest risk for substandard working conditions. To determine those priority locations, we conduct an annual risk analysis, 
incorporating internal and external data and input from IHS Markit, and the U.S. Department of State’s 2021 Trafficking in Persons Report and other market intelligence. As a result of this analysis, 
our list of 22 high-priority countries remained unchanged from 2020. 

Our audits did not reveal any instances of child, forced or involuntary labor over the past three years, although several suppliers’ policies and procedures lacked the required robustness to ensure 
compliance. This data is not broken down by region due to a limited sample size in some regions.

Operations that have been subject to human rights reviews or impact 
assessments

Ford’s We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment Policy applies to our own facilities as well as those of our joint venture partners and suppliers. We began doing formal 
assessments of Ford and joint venture facilities globally in 2004 and have conducted more than 56 human rights assessments since then.

In 2022, Ford used a more quantitative approach utilizing an established online third-party assessment tool from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) to assess human rights risks across global 
facilities in a consistent way. The RBA’s online assessment tool has been developed by human rights experts and provides companies with the opportunity to identify areas within their facilities that 
may be at more risk for human rights issues. Our 2021 supplier risk assessment included data from suppliers representing over 85% of our production global spend.

Employee training on human rights policies or procedures

Our Corporate Policies formally set out the expectations we have for our employees and others working on our behalf. These expectations are reinforced in mandatory online training courses for all Ford 
salaried full-time, part-time and agency workers, including an annual Code of Conduct course. These courses are periodically refreshed and reviewed to ensure the content remains relevant and appropriate. 

To ensure our employees have the training we need, we use an interactive learning experience platform. Degreed offers diverse learning opportunities for professional and personal development. 
Degreed is available to all Ford salaried employees. Our monthly usage ranges from 10,000-15,000 active users. As of the end of January 2022, we have 52,670 total users in the platform.

New suppliers that were screened using social criteria

In 2021, COVID-19 restrictions continued to impact our ability to conduct onsite supplier audits. Due to country and regional shutdowns and site-level safety measures, we had limited access to our 
planned supplier sites to conduct audits. To provide greater accessibility and flexibility with scheduling, we worked with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2020 to develop a remote supplier 
audit process, including RBA external validation and certification. We utilized the remote audit process for a portion of our 2021 audits, contributing to the completion of 75% of our planned initial 
audits for the year. The remaining 25% of initial supplier audits are scheduled for completion in early 2022. We conducted audits across a range of high-risk suppliers in 2021 and helped them to 
improve working conditions at their plants. Ford’s auditee list included suppliers representing a broad range of commodity groupings from all regions of the world that were identified using our risk 
assessment process.

Political contributions

Ford Motor Company does not make corporate contributions to political candidates or political organizations (but may do so in limited cases in some non-U.S. countries where it has operations). 
Company resources are not used for the purpose of electing candidates to public office, even when permitted by law. Nor do we take positions for partisan political purposes – that is, specifically for 
the purpose of advancing the interest of a political party or candidate for public office. We support a broad range of trade associations and coalitions to enhance our understanding of, and advocacy 
for, policy issues, including climate change. To learn more see 2021 U.S. Political Engagement Report.

When our views do not align with those of the associations to which we belong we reserve the right to make our own position clear.

GRI Appendix

Material Issue Definitions

Material Issue

Definition

Economic/Innovation

Mobility Solutions and Autonomous Vehicles

To help shape accessible and sustainable transportation, businesses must increase connectivity for vehicles, cities and infrastructure to improve air quality, ease congestion, broaden mobility and enhance customer experiences, while effectively 
managing security, safety and liability risks. There are five levels of self-driving technology (driver assistance through complete trip automation) to develop as well as new ownership models, including ridesharing, transit services and on-demand 
mobility solutions, to be explored.

Economic Performance

Economic performance relies on stable financial health, liquidity and resilient operations as well as the effective management of costs and risks. Working diligently to protect intellectual property and create a positive brand perception of Ford and 
its products are both essential to ensuring ongoing financial success.

Electrification and Alternative Fuels/ 
Batteries

Mobility businesses must harness the latest research and development (R&D) insights and innovative technologies for environmental and social good, developing affordable, efficient, low-carbon fuels and alternative powertrains. To stay ahead 
of the curve, resources need to be invested in identifying ways to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions from Ford vehicles in use by producing electrified versions of popular nameplates. This must extend to developing new, more efficient 
battery technology and ways to recycle batteries at end of life.

Environment

Climate Change, Air Quality and Renewable 
Energy/Energy Future

Climate change is undeniable; every organization has a responsibility to help reduce GHG emissions. Businesses must assess and respond to the impact of climate-related risks (extreme weather events, natural disasters, rising sea levels, floods, 
heatwaves, droughts, desertification, water shortages, tropical and vector-borne diseases, etc.) on product strategy, facility and physical infrastructure resiliency, supply chains, regulatory environment and consumer demand. Pursuing carbon 
neutrality in line with science-based targets requires reductions in CO2 emissions from upstream and downstream activities, including Ford’s direct and indirect operations and logistics, and use of lower-carbon fuels. Optimizing energy use 
includes contributing to a greener, more resilient grid with increased access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy – including renewable sources – for Ford’s business and customers.

Water Use/Water Stewardship

Water stewardship means ensuring efficient water use, management, treatment and discharge by Ford’s operations. It requires assessment and mitigation of the impacts of water use by Ford and its suppliers on local communities, based on levels 
of water stress, availability and quality. Fresh water should be used for human consumption only.

Waste Management

Vehicle end-of-life must be well managed, operational waste minimized and zero waste to landfill targeted, including a phase-out of single-use plastics. Reduced non-GHG emissions and effluents must also be worked toward with increased 
recycling rates, reduced packaging and resource conservation.

Sustainable Materials – Material Design 
and Management

Innovation efforts should be directed toward developing sustainable materials for use in vehicles, including renewable and recycled materials, sustainable chemicals and a reduction in substances of concern. Product, process and material 
innovations should support the circular economy. Sustainability considerations should be made throughout the material life cycle, including product R&D, agricultural activities, human capital impacts and operational logistics.

Social

Human Rights and Supply Chain Management Human rights and good labor relations must be respected throughout operations and the supply chain in line with our We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment Policy expectations, local regulations and policies, and 

corporate human rights strategy. This includes addressing our salient human rights issues: access to water and sanitation; air quality; child labor; climate change; equal and fair wages; forced labor and ethical recruitment; harssment and 
discrimination; human trafficking; occupational health, safety and wellbeing; product safety and quality. Additionally, job stability and security, economic impacts and competitive wages, human rights within the communities that we operate in 
and supply chain, humanitarian relief and resilience and work stoppage must all be addressed. Businesses should employ responsible supply chain and sourcing practices that never knowingly contribute to human rights abuses, including child and 
forced labor, bribery or corruption, or environmental concerns. It is also important to maintain effective supplier management and open communication of expectations regarding compliance with local laws, reporting requirements (for example, 
conflict minerals such as cobalt and mica, 3TG reporting), customer terms and conditions, respect for indigenous populations, and water and land rights. To ensure supply continuity, capacity building and improved performance, including greater 
environmental performance, potential supply chain risks must be understood and measures taken to mitigate them.

Human Capital and Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion

It is important for businesses to foster a collaborative culture with strong labor relations and collective bargaining and to develop the skills and capabilities needed today and in the future through continuous, agile learning. Talent attraction, 
recruitment and retention is key to building an effective, capable and adaptive workforce, and organizations must provide decent work, fair compensation and job security. In turn, promoting employee engagement, training and education, 
leadership development and succession planning are all crucial elements in workforce development.

An inclusive and diverse workplace is critical to build a stronger business, and global workforces should be built on equal opportunity and inclusion. They should promote diversity in all its forms, reflecting the makeup of the communities that 
surround an organization. Fair, just and inclusive work cultures are ones where women’s rights are respected and promoted and where gender balance is improved throughout the company.

Externally, support should be offered to a diverse range of minority-, women- and veteran-owned suppliers, promoting social and economic inclusion and fighting racial injustice.

Material Issue Definitions (continued)

Material Issue

Definition

Employee Wellness, Health and Safety

Health and safety pertain to providing and maintaining a work environment that meets or exceeds applicable legal standards for occupational health and safety, and organizations are responsible for providing such an environment for all 
personnel, including employees, contractors and visitors.

This extends to ensuring the physical and mental health and wellness of employees, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also means phasing out harmful process chemicals and putting measures in place to protect human health 
during their use in the workplace.

Customer Engagement, Marketing and 
Satisfaction

Ford’s products and services, including information and consumer education about new product lines and technology, should always be responsibly advertised and marketed. This involves being responsive to evolving market demand and 
changes in consumer preferences for vehicle type, features and technology to maintain customer satisfaction, loyalty and trust. It also calls for human-centered design to be harnessed to enhance the entire user experience, from purchase to use.

Socioeconomic Contribution and Community 
Engagement

Targeted investment, positive engagement and partnering for sustainable development are valuable tools for strengthening local communities.

Applying Ford technologies, as well as promoting STEM education and youth development, supporting small businesses and diverse entrepreneurs, and providing support for communities in the form of disaster relief, volunteering and corporate 
philanthropy, all help address societal challenges at a local level.

Vehicle/Product Quality and Safety

We must maintain customer satisfaction and the quality of Ford’s products, including safety, performance issues, recalls and third-party ratings. Vehicles are designed using standards that ensure they meet or exceed all applicable laws and 
regulations and do not represent harm or hazards to consumers. They will offer state-of-the-art passive and active safety features, as well as driver assist technology to prevent or mitigate accidents.

Governance

Transparency, Ethics and Integrity

Corporate governance structures are put in place to combat corruption, bribery and conflicts of interest and manage corporate risk, while embedded ethical business practices and corporate responsibility ensure organizations are operating in line 
with business codes of conduct. Companies must promote integrity throughout their operations, empowering employees to take responsibility for their own actions. This should be accompanied by regular, transparent reporting on performance, 
goals and challenges.

Government Regulation, Policy and 
Engagement

Complying with government regulations, policies and expectations on a range of issues, including climate change, taxation and environmental standards, is critical to responsible business operation. Any lobbying or engagement with governments 
on public policy development and environmental justice should be done in a responsible manner, while a business must ensure it effectively manages any political activities and third-party representatives.

Accountable and Inclusive Governance

Ensuring transparent and accountable corporate governance practices is critical to managing business risks and promoting the fair and effective functioning of the Board, its committees and the company. These practices include Board 
composition decisions, ESG training for Board members, diversity efforts and executive compensation. The Board and its committees are also responsible for risk oversight and ensuring the correct measures are in place to detect and mitigate any 
potential issues.

It is the responsibility of the company to assure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, as well as internal policies, with the support of the Audit Committee. Increasingly innovative practices and technologies should be developed to 
improve environmental and social sustainability with oversight from the Sustainability, Innovation and Policy Committee.

Security and Data Privacy

When employees and customers entrust a business with their data, it is the responsibility of the company to use it, and artificial intelligence tools, responsibly. Data science and analytics enable a better understanding of consumer behavior and 
should be harnessed to help maintain user privacy and improve digital and physical asset security.

Our Stakeholders

Communities

Who they are

Why they are important

How we engage

Communities where we live and work and where we partner with businesses, schools, nonprofit service organizations and 
government organizations are critical to our future. Through our philanthropic arm, Ford Fund, we’ve been giving back and 
building strong communities for more than 70 years through grantmaking, volunteerism and developing programs to meet 
specific community needs, Working across the Ford network in the U.S. and around the world, we provide access to resources 
and opportunities that build equity, help make people’s lives better and create opportunities for growth. 

Communities are the lifeblood of any 
society or culture. By engaging with 
our communities, we can help people 
in need, understand what our 
customers want, and strengthen the 
bonds that make us a viable and 
relevant business.

Customers

We want to treat customers like family, which is the key to providing not only the products and services they need, but also 
developing strong customer relationships that can last a lifetime. Interacting face-to-face, on the phone, or through the 
Ford.com website and social media, we value our customers and always strive to earn their trust. And through our Consumer 
Insight process and market research, we listen and respond to their feedback, increasing our understanding of their needs, 
concerns and preferences.

Without customers, Ford would not 
exist, so it’s vital that we do everything 
we can to nurture these relationships 
and provide the products and services 
they want and need.

• Consumer insight process
• Market research
• Customer care programs
• Dealer interactions
• Ford.com website
• Ford Owners magazine

Dealers

Dealers (sales and service people) are often the first Ford representatives that our customers come in contact with. We rely 
on their expertise and dedication, actively engaging and collaborating through Dealer Councils and roundtables, as well as the 
creation of advertising and public service announcements. An important touchpoint for us is the Dealer Attitude Survey, which
provides us with useful information and insights. To honor their excellence, we conduct our annual Salute to Dealers awards.

Dealers are an essential part of the 
Ford family because they are the most 
direct link between our products and 
services and our customers. Dealers 
are typically the only connection 
customers have with Ford.

• Brand sales and service representatives
• Brand Dealer Councils

Employees

Employees are Ford’s number one asset. We can only operate successfully through their hard work and dedication – from 
research scientists and truck drivers to production engineers and accountants. To be in touch with our 183,000+ employees 
around the world, we use every available tool and opportunity, including our intranet platform, social media sites, facilities 
visits, and business meetings (online and in person), and executive Q&A sessions/Town Halls with senior management. We 
strengthen employee relations by maintaining an ongoing dialogue with union representatives and through joint labor–
management committees. And we gain valuable insights through employee surveys and our recent company-wide diversity, 
equity and inclusion (DEI) audit. The initiatives organized by our 11 Employee Resource Groups are also important catalysts 
for fostering a culture of belonging.

Ford employees run the organization 
at every level. Their strength, 
commitment and dedication, and 
their emotional connection to the 
company, can’t be judged only as 
assets with a monetary value. 
They are Ford’s heart and soul. 

Investors, Analysts 
and Shareholders

For our institutional and individual investors – our shareholders – to believe that Ford will continue to succeed financially, 
they tend to rely on the opinions and research done by financial analysts who study the company in great detail. To make sure 
we communicate effectively with these financial stakeholders, we provide a broad range of material, including our Integrated 
Sustainability and Financial Report, Proxy Statements, our annual report on Form 10-K (SEC filings) and quarterly earnings 
releases. These published documents provide vital information on the company that supplement our annual shareholder 
meetings, investor conferences, fireside chats and annual ESG roadshows.

Investors, analysts and shareholders 
are instrumental in providing capital 
to maintain and grow our business. 
And since they are profit oriented, they 
insist that capital is invested properly 
and funds are managed accurately.

Our Stakeholders (continued)

Who they are

Why they are important

How we engage

Suppliers

Hundreds of businesses, large and small, provide Ford with the materials, technologies and services that we need to produce 
market-leading, cost-effective cars and trucks. From engine components to recycled fabric for car seats, we rely on suppliers 
from all over the world and maintain stringent standards and rules to make sure our products are of the highest quality. In 
addition to holding regular meetings with individual suppliers as required, we also share best practices to help them with 
everything from improving workplace safety, treating their employees fairly and without prejudice, and reducing their impact 
on the environment. To strengthen these initiatives and relationships, we are also supporters and members and of a wide 
range of external supplier organizations, coalitions and associations.

Suppliers play a huge role at every 
stage of the product lifecycle, from 
sourcing raw materials to helping 
ramp up production, thereby making 
a significant contribution to our value, 
growth and development.

• Top Supplier meetings
• Ford Partnership for A Cleaner Environment (PACE)
• Supplier quality roundtables
• Supplier Diversity Development Networking
• External supplier organizations
• Coalitions including the RBA and AIAG
• Supplier Code of Conduct

Government and 
NGOs

Local, state, national, and international governments create policies that have an impact on Ford’s businesses. These policies 
can economically, environmentally, and socially sustainably impact our company, our customers, and their communities. 
Nongovernmental organizations also play a role in helping to shape the policies that impact our business and communities 
where we work, live and serve. Working with NGOs, we can help provide access to resources and opportunities that build 
equity and help underserved and underrepresented communities reach their highest potential

• Work with the United States Congress and the White House, as well as governments globally, 
• Engage with Trade Associations and Memberships Focusing on U.S. Policy Issues
• Work with various NGOs through Ford Fund

It is critical that Ford has a voice to 
help inform the policies affecting 
our employees, customers, and 
shareholders. We believe strong 
engagement with government 
plays a key role in shaping the 
regulations and legislation that 
govern our business. NGOs can 
help us identify opportunities for 
leadership and improvement in 
our sustainability actions.

The weight of recovered/recycled material depends on the infrastructure available in the geographic region in which the vehicle is sold. 
In North America and the EU, over 85% of vehicle parts are recycled or reused at their end of life.

Ford remanufactures a number of components for the aftermarket and has many uses for recycled content in our components, including 
rubber from post- consumer tires in underbody covers, recycled plastic bottles in carpet and nylon from carpeting in cylinder head covers. 
Parts remanufactured and with recycled content also vary by region.

The current average recycled plastic content of a European vehicle is 6.5 percent; that is to say, of all the plastics used within the vehicle, 
6.5 percent by weight2 is sourced from recyclate.3

UNGC Principle

Environment 

Report location and page number

7.  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.

The precautionary principle is the idea that if the consequences of an action are unknown but are judged to have some potential for major or irreversible negative consequences, then it is better to 
avoid that action. We do not formally apply the precautionary principle to decision-making across all of our activities. However, it has influenced our thinking. For example, in addressing climate 
change as a business issue, we have employed this principle. In addition, we assess and manage environmental, safety, supply chain, operational and other risks as described throughout this report.

Contributing to the  
United Nations Sustainable  
Development Goals  
(UN SDGs)

In 2015, the Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development. At the core of this agenda are 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – 
the 169 targets that support them – which are intended to end poverty, protect the planet 
and ensure prosperity for all.

Our Priorities

Since 2016, Ford Motor Company has been a signatory to the UN SDGs and we remain committed to contributing 
to progress toward them. We have identified 11 SDGs where we can make the greatest impact. Achieving them 
by 2030 will require multi-stakeholder collaboration at a local, national and international level, so we call on our 
stakeholders and partners to join us as we strive to meet these ambitions.

Within Ford, regular discussions involving our global sustainability team, various skill teams and the Sustainability, 
Innovation, and Policy Committee of the Board of Directors help to examine our performance through the lens of 
the SDGs. We remain committed to building on the UN’s SDG framework to enhance our sustainability initiatives 
as we work to become the world’s most trusted company.

The following pages include examples of how we are contributing to the SDGs and where further information on 
these efforts can be found.

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

More Information

Addressing three of our salient human rights issues – product 
safety and quality; occupational health, safety and well-being; and 
air quality – Ford cares about customer safety, and vehicle safety 
will always be one of our highest priorities. We are working towards 
zero-emissions from our vehicles and facilities to help improve air 
quality, and a future that is free from vehicle crashes and workplace 
injuries. We understand that for our own employees and community 
members to reach their full potential, we must support their 
physical, mental and emotional health and wellbeing and maintain 
the highest levels of safety throughout the supply chain.

Air Quality:
• We are addressing air quality in our vehicles, our operations and our financing. Through our research, vehicle development and operations, we are 

working to reduce emissions of non-CO2 pollutants, in accordance with increasingly stringent standards around the world. We acknowledge internal 
combustion engines emit pollutants that can affect air quality. We are compliant with or surpass all global criteria for emission requirements. 
At the same time, we continue to develop our alternative fuels portfolio and have committed to working towards all sales of new cars and vans 
being zero-emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets. 

• The electrification of our iconic nameplates continues to progress as we bring electric vehicles to the mainstream market. The all-electric Mustang 
Mach-E was launched in North America and Europe in late 2020 and came to China in 2021. The all-electric F-150 Lightning and E-Transit cargo van 
will debut in 2022. These vehicles will help residential and commercial business customers achieve sustainability goals, and help cities and 
industrial areas improve air quality. By 2030 we expect all-electric vehicles to make up 50% of our global sales.

• On the manufacturing side we have significantly reduced emissions from Ford manufacturing facilities in China. From 2020 to November 2021, 
plants reduced VOC emissions intensity by 17% (3.7 g/m2), equivalent to an annual reduction of more than 200 metric tons of absolute VOC 
emissions through various management and engineering investment measures, contributing to cleaner air. 

• We linked ESG metrics to $15.5B Corporate and Supplemental Revolvers and launched our first $2.5B green bond. Net proceeds from sustainable 

financing will help fund our clean transportation and clean manufacturing activities. 

• 

To build environmental capacity, particularly regarding the reduction of air emissions, we collaborate with our suppliers through our Partnership 
for A Cleaner Environment (PACE) program. We have shared best practice projects, including air emissions reductions, with nearly 80 key suppliers 
through PACE.

Product Safety:
• In 2021, we introduced a safety aspiration to work toward a future that is free from vehicle crashes. The safety and quality of our vehicles will always 

be a top priority. Our systems help ensure that our vehicles meet or exceed performance and quality standards. We play a leading role in vehicle 
safety and driver assist innovation and are working to develop new safety technologies. 

• In 2021, Ford doubled the number of TOP SAFETY PICK awards from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, bringing the total number of awards to 10.
• For the 2021 model year, a total of 20 Ford and Lincoln nameplates were rated with 5-Star Overall Vehicle Scores in one or more markets across the 

U.S., Europe, and China New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) as of January 2022.

• To achieve high levels of safety performance, we conduct engineering analyses, computer simulations and component, subsystem and full-vehicle 
crash tests at several sites in the United States and Europe, including crash-test facilities, the VIRTTEX (Virtual Test Track Experiment) and the 
Research and Innovation Center in Dearborn, Michigan. 

• Ford and Lincoln Co-Pilot360TM driver assist technologies use a combination of radar, sonar and cameras to sense and interpret the environment, 
helping customers around the world to drive safely and confidently, alerting them to potential collisions, protecting pedestrians and cyclists and 
making routine tasks easier. 

• Driver-assist features are supplemental and do not replace the driver’s attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle. Ford BlueCruise is a 
hands-free highway driving feature. Only remove hands from the steering wheel when in a Hands-Free Blue Zone. Always watch the road and be 
prepared to resume control of the vehicle. It does not replace safe driving. See Owner’s Manual for detail and limitations. Requires purchased 3-year 
connected service plan with regular map updates, FordPass App, and modem activation.

• Our new BlueCruise technology* builds upon available Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane Centering and Speed Sign 

Recognition. It allows drivers in Hands-Free Blue Zones to operate their vehicle hands-free while being monitored by a driver-facing camera to make 
sure they are keeping their eyes on the road. 

• Ford has pledged to equip a minimum of 95% of all new lightweight vehicles we produce for the U.S. market with automatic emergency braking 
(AEB) by September 2022. Ford is meeting the commitment ahead of time at 96%. We have also committed to installing AEB on vehicles in the 
8,501 to 10,000-pound range by 2025/26 and have already equipped 62 percent of those heavier vehicles with AEB.

• We developed a Rear Occupant Alert System that gives an “in-vehicle” warning via our SYNC® system. The system is included in all four-door 2021 

model year vehicles equipped with SYNC in the U.S.

• Our SYNC in-car connectivity helps occupants to call for assistance after an accident, and can give first responders potentially life-saving 

information, quickly and efficiently.

* Driver-assist features are supplemental and do not replace the driver’s attention, judgment, and need to control the vehicle. Ford BlueCruise is a hands-free highway driving feature. Only remove hands from the steering wheel when in a Hands-Free Blue Zone. Always watch the road and be prepared to resume control of the vehicle. It does not replace safe driving. See Owner’s Manual for 

detail and limitations. Requires purchased 3-year connected service plan with regular map updates, FordPass App, and modem activation.

Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

More Information

Occupational Health, Safety and Well-Being:
• In 2021, we continued to focus on identifying potentially fatal events and high potential incidents involving our employees and contractors globally. 
From these incidents, global corrective actions are initiated and tracked to ensure that the identified causal factors are addressed. These corrective 
actions are tracked weekly to ensure timely completion.

• We continue to provide programs and services that help employees achieve good health and wellbeing and make informed choices. We provide a 
broad array of resources and solutions to educate employees, build capability, and meet individual and organizational wellbeing needs and goals. 

• We are also leveraging feedback from our ERGs to gain input into improving the employee experience, product programs and marketing. In 2021, 
the Ford Empowering Diverse Abilities (FEDA) and Ford Pride ERGs partnered closely with Ford Land on the development of building standards 
for new and renovated spaces for those who need accommodations or have access requirements that may not be typical.

• We continue to rely on our best-in-class COVID-19 playbook to guide our response to the ongoing pandemic and the protocols we developed remain 

in place.

• Our five Ford Resource and Engagement Centers (FRECs) – two in Detroit and one each in South Africa, Romania and Thailand – serve their 

communities with a range of services, including basic needs such as distributing food and providing help with shelter. Our FRECs have also played 
a significant role in COVID-19 relief efforts.

• We worked to help people in our communities around the world manage the pandemic. We opened a community vaccine center in Craiova, Romania, 

vaccinating 13,000 of the community’s most vulnerable residents.

• Our Supplier Code of Conduct mandates our suppliers to provide a healthy and safe working environment that meets or exceeds local and national 
safety, occupational health, and fire safety legislation, and to provide regular risk assessments, training to workers, Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE) at no cost to workers, and to implement an effective fire safety management system and emergency plan at every supplier worksite.

SDG 4: Quality Education

Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

More Information

Through continual, agile learning, we can support our employees, 
suppliers, dealers and communities to keep pace with a rapidly 
evolving world. Education and training opportunities give people 
the best chance of fulfilling their potential, support capacity 
building in our supply chain and prepare the next generation 
of designers, engineers and technicians for the challenges and 
changes in technology that lie ahead.

Lifelong Learning Opportunities:
• Developing our people is critical to our future success as well as ensuring employee satisfaction. We are committing significant resources to provide 
employees with insight into organizational skill needs, developing learning solutions to address those needs and enabling our people to apply those 
skills to improve performance.

• Our FordWorks inclusive hiring program helps us deliver on-the-job training and employment opportunities to neurodiverse individuals. Continual 

development of FordWorks employees is one of the core values of the program.

• In 2021, we focused on energizing our 15,000+ people leaders. New developmental experiences for executives and people leaders are being 

designed and implemented. Focus areas include digital transformation, DEI, and new ways of working. We are also starting a virtual Leadership 
Academy, which includes a collection of learning journeys specifically designed to address each leader’s needs based on where they are in the 
leadership lifecycle.

• In 2022 we will also focus on launching our Professional Development Journey. This program will serve as a self- directed learning guide for every 

employee, independent of level/skill team/region, to excel in the skills needed to take ownership of and navigate their career and achieve success. 
The program will focus on four key skill set areas, with a spotlight on the crucial Foundational Skills of self- awareness, growth mindset, and 
learning agility.

• In 2022 we will launch the Ford Software Academy, designed to provide our talent with a space to learn, grow, collaborate, and build their capabilities. 

More than a collection of courses, the Ford Software Academy will be a fully realized journey, sponsored by business leaders, and built to support 
career-long learning. 

• We developed a Skill Sprint Program to enhance capability in the U.K. workforce at all experience levels. Ford of Europe put into effect four priority 
sprints, covering skills, environment, innovation, and digitization, to reskill and redeploy personnel, compete for talent against tech companies 
outside the automotive industry, and instill a continuous learning culture. The program, which has trained 1,400 people across disciplines and 
functions, was the I4CP Next Practice Award winner in 2021.

• Mentoring is also a key strategy to engage our employees and help them grow. 2022 brings the launch of Mentoring@Ford, a global online tool 

to match employees with a mentor or a mentee. 

• In our U.S. Recruiting, we have significantly expanded outreach to women, minorities, veterans, and people with disabilities. We’re transforming 
campus recruiting using AI and are leveraging tech and platforms to reach new schools. We’ve opened attendance at recruitment events and 
removed the blockages which kept students from attending.

• To transform America’s auto technician industry, we have made a $525 million investment across the U.S. during the next five years. The investment 
will go toward job training and career readiness initiatives to develop highly skilled technicians that can support our growing portfolio of connected 
electric vehicles.

• Our commitment to talent development is also illustrated in the development of our skilled trades workforce. Ford has committed $5M in ongoing 

capital investment into the UAW-Ford Technical Training Center (TTC). In partnership with local community colleges, local, state and federal 
agencies and union leaders, the TTC is a world class center for apprentice training development and skilled trades recruiting and training. In 2021, 
almost 1,800 participants utilized training at the TTC as part of their development.

• We have partnered with Responsible Business Alliance and Drive Sustainability to develop new e-learning modules and training webinars for suppliers.
• To build supplier capacity on tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (3TG) and cobalt due diligence, we leveraged resources such as the Responsible 

Mining Initiative eLearning Academy and our own Ford developed modules to train nearly 100 supplier companies in 2021.

Learning in the Community:
• Our Ford Research and Engagement Centers (FREC) in Detroit, South Africa, Romania and Thailand bring nonprofit partners together to support 

the communities they serve, from basic needs such as food and shelter to job training, mentoring and educational opportunities.

• Ford is Strategic Partner of FIRST®, helping to build engineers and scientists of the future. We actively sponsor teams in 117 high schools and in 136 

elementary and middle schools located across the United States. More than 240 Ford employees mentor students during the year, working together 
to grow students’ knowledge of STEM. In Detroit, we’ve sponsored the Detroit Hispanic Development Corp.’s FIRST Robotic Competition teams, as 
well as creating a career technical education program and providing funding to update their machining shop.

• The Ford Motorsports team is leaning into DEI and STEM as well, using racing to rev up engineering interests among Detroit high school girls. 

Teammates partnered with the Girls in Engineering Academy to create workshops that expose the girls to aerodynamics, wind tunnels, pit stop 
demonstrations, and more. The girls also met the inspiring Shelby Hall, a top Ford off-roading racer.

• 2021 marked the fifth year of our partnership with Primary Engineer – an educational nonprofit organization that encourages children and youth ages 
3 to 19 to consider STEM and engineering careers. Employees from Ford’s Dunton engineering campus volunteer their time at local schools training 
teachers on how to introduce engineering concepts, while helping lead a classroom-based engineering project that teaches students how to build 
electric vehicles. To date, the program has reached 65 schools and assisted 140 teachers and more than 3,483 students across the United Kingdom 
with the help of 45 Ford volunteers.

• In 2021, the Ford Fund launched the Ford Driving Dreams Scholarship program in Argentina. This social impact initiative focuses on helping young 

people graduate on time and continue their higher education.

SDG 5: Gender Equality

Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

The strongest businesses promote diversity, equity and inclusion. 
In line with our sustainability aspiration to create a truly diverse 
culture where everyone feels like they belong, we are focused on 
creating a culture where women can thrive. This includes ensuring 
women are equally represented at all levels of our business and 
supporting initiatives that empower women and girls.

Gender Diversity:
• We have a responsibility to our employees; our approach of “Care for Each Other” is a central part of the Ford+ plan. Ford does not tolerate violence, 
hate speech, harassment or discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to gender, gender identity, race, color, religion, age, national origin, 
sexual orientation, disability or veteran status. 

• In 2021, we extended our U.S. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Audit to seven major markets – Canada, China, Germany, South Africa, Mexico, 

UK, and India. The audits encompassed a deep dive into each country’s qualitative data and quantitative data, focus groups, surveys and interviews 
to gain insights into employee beliefs, all with a goal of developing a deeper understanding of how our team was feeling and why. While culture and 
issues differ around the world, a common theme emerged that not all our team members feel like they belong. We listened and in response each 
Business Unit and Skill Team is committed to continued action.

• In 2021, we created DEI Aspirational Goals to increase the gender diversity of our senior leadership. These goals are tracked quarterly by every Skill 
Team and Business Unit Leader. Composition is not something that can change dramatically in a short period of time, but we are seeing progress 
in≈the diversity of senior leadership. An increase in women leaders globally indicates that we are on track to reach our 2025 DEI Aspirational Goals. 

• In 2022, every salaried employee will have a DEI objective in their performance review. We will continue building our data gathering and metrics 

capability in order to leverage actionable insights. 

• To bring a more diverse range of talent into the organization, we worked closely with Women of Ford to ensure we had female recruiters on every 

virtual conference we attended.

• Through our Culture Manager program, we have implemented a Manufacturing Culture Playbook which provides a framework for plant managers 

to assess their work environments and build plant specific actions to anticipate, address or prevent issues and sustain positive cultures. By mid-2022 
all plants in the US and Canada will be supported by a Culture Manager.

• We remain committed to support, develop, grow and promote our diverse suppliers while expanding the economic impact and growth in the 

community for a more sustainable future. In 2021 we sourced $1.16B from women-owned businesses.* 

• In an effort to expand our spend, Ford made a strategic decision to identify global initiatives to support our diverse owned businesses beginning with 
women-owned businesses. We are in the discovery phase of expansion, identifying current suppliers that could qualify as a woman owned business. 

Equal pay for Equal Work:
• Ford’s commitment to equal pay for equal work applies to all forms of pay, including base salary, incentives, bonuses, and other forms of compensation. 

Ford shares a Pay Equity Statement with our employees to communicate Ford’s commitment to this fundamental value. 

• Ford remains committed to compliance with fair pay laws in all regions and countries and to ongoing review of our compensation data and practices 

to ensure they are fair, equitable, and free of bias due to race, gender, or any other similar characteristics. 

• We annually review our compensation data and practices globally. We utilize outside experts to conduct a thorough statistical analysis of salaried 
compensation throughout our U.S. workforce. If business-related explanations for the statistical outcomes are not identified, Ford makes salary 
adjustments to address these situations. 

• Ford is also taking positive steps to promote transparency by providing data on the current state of pay equity and progress that the company is 
making. Ford believes that open communication can only advance the cause of pay equity and equal employment opportunity. We share our pay 
equity ratio via our annual Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report. 

• The company has policies and practices to help deter unintentional inequities. These include: not asking for a candidate’s salary history during 

the recruitment process, establishing standard starting salaries by degree/position for entry-level new hires, establishing promotional guidelines 
based on pre-promotional position within the salary range that allow lower paid employees to receive larger increases, and correcting specific pay 
relationships that are contributing to inequity. 

• We are focused on creating a supportive work environment where women can thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Ford was included in the 

Bloomberg Gender- Equality Index (GEI) in 2021. 

• We align with and are signatories of internationally recognized labor standards such as the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles.

*Actual data through November 2021, forecast data for December 2021.

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

Access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation is seen as a 
salient human rights issue. Water is also critical to our manufacturing 
operations, so we aspire to make zero water withdrawals for our 
manufacturing processes and use freshwater only for human 
consumption. We work with our supply chain, especially in water- 
stressed locations, to reduce water consumption.

Water Management in our Operations:
• Our long-term approach reflects the need to understand water challenges in their local context, with extraction policies and practices designed 

to make sure our operations do not adversely affect other users’ access to water. 

• Our 2025 Global Manufacturing Water Strategy, the third iteration of our water strategy, aims to continue Ford’s position as a leader in water 

reduction and secure optimal freshwater availability in local communities. It targets a 15% reduction in absolute freshwater usage. Ford has already 
reduced its annual water consumption by over 75% since 2000; that’s over 12.5 billion gallons of water. Our global water conservation actions are 
equal to providing a year’s worth of water to 1.4 million homes. 

• In 2021, Ford earned a place on the CDP “A List” for protecting water security. We have received an A score rating from CDP for water reduction for 
seven years in a row and are one of only 118 companies globally to earn such an award for water security. We were also on CDP’s Climate Change 
“A list” for the third straight year. We are one of only two North American OEMs to obtain double A List status. 

• We will continue to work towards our existing aspirational goals of freshwater for human consumption only and zero water withdrawals for 
manufacturing. This includes establishing local ecosystem performance goals and improving water discharge quality, with a focus on direct 
discharge plants. We are examining how water cycling impacts communities and how to better emulate the natural system.

• We are applying freshwater reduction methods as well as improving our water quality discharges at our sites that mimic the behavior and 

performance of the local ecosystem. 

• We have made progress toward our aspiration of using freshwater only for human consumption in our facilities that are in water-scarce regions, 

such as Mexico, China and South Africa. In 2021, our use of alternative water exceeded 7% in these regions. 

• Chennai Engine and Assembly has joined our Chihuahua Engine facility in using zero freshwater for its manufacturing processes. 
• Ford’s Sanand Vehicle Assembly & Engine Plant in Gujarat, India has zero water discharge, with a 110,000 m3 rain water harvesting pond used for 

pallet washing, irrigation, and in the cooling towers.

• Our new plant in Tennessee aspires to make zero freshwater withdrawals for assembly processes by incorporating water reuse and recycling 

systems. Stakeholders responded positively to our goal of preserving water and striving for full water recycling.

• Our South Africa Silverton Plant has the aspirational goal of being net zero and carbon neutral as well as full water recycling. 
• Water use and recycling are occurring at Ford plants around the world. We continue to integrate more water-efficient processes and technologies 

as we work to further decrease our water consumption. Prior to COVID-19 we were on target to reduce absolute water by over 25% (10% normalized) 
compared to the 2015 baseline. 

•  Ford’s Cuautitlán Stamping and Assembly Plant replaced the asphalt parking lots within the plant with ecological concrete, which allows rain to reenter 

the ground. This recharges the aquifer beneath the plant and helps prevent water scarcity in the city and in surrounding ecosystems and habitats.

• Absolute water was down 15% from the year prior and down 32% from the 2019 strategy baseline – an almost 80% reduction from the initial 2000 

water strategy. However, these reductions were largely attributed to vehicle manufacturing down time associated with the global microchip shortage. 

• The Ford Valencia plant in Spain uses a biological wastewater treatment plant to extract oils, fats, heavy metals and suspended solids, while two 

lagoons help make the water suitable for irrigating the surrounding eucalyptus trees.

Water Management in our Supply Chains:
• According to our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers are required to provide workers with clean toilet facilities, potable water, and sanitary 

eating facilities. In alignment with the United Nations CEO Water Mandate, they must also reduce freshwater usage and support safe and accessible 
drinking water in their manufacturing operations and communities. 

• To build environmental capacity, particularly regarding sustainable water use and management, we collaborate with our suppliers through our 

Partnership for A Cleaner Environment (PACE) program. We have shared best practice examples with more than 50 key Tier 1 suppliers through PACE. 

• PACE participants expect to save an estimated 182 million gallons of water in their operations from 2020 to 2030. Our new streamlined version of 
the program, FastPACE, is helping reduce the impact of key suppliers in China, India, Thailand and South Africa. FastPACE suppliers are on track to 
save an estimated 24 million gallons of water over the next three years. 

• To better understand our suppliers’ water use we survey a selection of them every year using the CDP Supply Chain program’s Water Security 

questionnaires. This provides us with qualitative and quantitative information about how our production suppliers manage environmental risks 
and maximize opportunities.

• Operating a fresh food delivery pilot with an autonomous shuttle out of the Ford Resource and Engagement Center in Southwest Detroit through 

the summer of 2022.

• We are addressing air quality in our vehicles, our operations and our financing. Through our research, vehicle development and operations, we are 

working to reduce emissions of air pollutants, in accordance with increasingly stringent standards around the world.

• Ford continues to collaborate with others testing autonomous vehicle technologies within several business associations, as well as lawmakers, 

regulators, and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of autonomous vehicles.

• Our end-to-end solutions help lower total cost of ownership for our customers, and in particular, reduce complexity for commercial customers.
• Through Ford Pro, we will also help small and large businesses globally transition their fleets to zero emission vehicles by providing a suite of 

support, including EV consulting, charging, telematics, service, and financing.

• The City:One program uses a community-centered approach to develop innovative mobility solutions that address safety, sustainability, equity 
and accessibility to support the ever-changing mobility needs of cities and their residents. In 2019–2020, we hosted City:One Challenges in four 
locations: Indianapolis, Michigan Central Station in Detroit, Austin and Mexico City. In working with those communities, we generated more than 
400 proposals and secured nearly $1 million in funding to support tangible and equitable mobility pilots for residents, workers and visitors. In 2021, 
multiple Challenge winners began activating their mobility pilots to deliver real-world impact. 

• During the last three years, Ford has been restoring historic buildings, including the iconic Michigan Central Station, constructing new ones and 

building out connected spaces in Corktown, Detroit to transform the area into Michigan Central, a mobility innovation district that brings together 
innovators to incubate and speed development of transportation solutions. While construction is still underway, innovation in the district is already 
happening. One example is a partnership with Newlab, a New York-based accelerator, that began in 2020. Together, Michigan Central and Newlab 
have created two mobility innovation studios. One to address mobility issues on a macro scale with an EV track focused on electrifying commercial 
fleets, as well as an autonomous vehicle track focused on the first and last mile of a journey. The second, a civic studio – Accessible Streets – 
designed to improve transportation and access in the neighborhoods around Michigan Central Station – all upholding our commitment to the 
local communities. 

• In collaboration with a Ford Fund and Gleaners Community Food Bank food delivery program called FREC (Ford Resource and Engagement Center) 
on the Go, we are operating a pilot through the summer of 2022 to deliver fresh produce to mobility-challenged senior citizens via an autonomous 
low-speed shuttle.

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production

Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

Why Is This a Priority?

How We’re Contributing

More Information

Manufacturing vehicles requires the use of natural resources, 
some of which have a limited or finite supply. We aspire to eliminate
single-use plastics from our operations by 2030, reach true zero 
waste to landfill across our operations and utilize only recycled 
or renewable content in vehicle plastics.

Our Operations:
• Ford and SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion and create nearly 11,000 new jobs in Tennessee and Kentucky with production of the electric vehicles 
and lithium-ion batteries in 2025, creating first greenfield carbon neutral facilities. The assembly plant will be designed to be carbon nuetral with 
zero-waste to landfill once fully operational.

• We invested $1 billion to modernize our vehicle assembly facility in Cologne to turn it into the Ford Cologne Electrification Center.

Waste and Recycling:
• We aspire to reach true zero waste to landfill across our operations and eliminate single-use plastics from our operations by 2030. 
• We reuse or recycle any waste we do generate wherever possible, avoiding the landfill and providing us with an additional supply of valuable resources. 
• Over five years from a 2017 baseline, we are targeting a 35% reduction in waste sent to landfill, a 15% reduction in waste generation and a 25% 

reduction in general trash. We are developing a strategy to achieve our aspiration of eliminating single-use plastics from our global operations by 2030. 

• In addition to our focus on reducing waste to landfill at our facilities, we are focused on minimizing the amount of waste we generate. Beginning in 
the third quarter of 2021, all Ford manufacturing plants in China achieved zero waste to landfill (ZWTL). Waste generated in all factories will either 
be managed for thermal destruction with or without energy recovery or recycled instead of being sent to landfills for final disposal. All of our 
European facilities have acquired ZWTL status, which means they send absolutely no waste to landfill. 

• Ford has 89 zero waste to landfill (ZWTL) sites globally, including manufacturing and non-manufacturing sites.
• 74% of manufacturing facilities are true ZWTL.
• Ford Thailand Manufacturing and AutoAlliance Thailand are making significant efforts to support environmentally friendly initiatives, including 

using renewable energy, reducing CO2 emissions, and practicing zero waste to landfill.

• In 2021, Ford facilities around the world sent approximately 16,300 metric tons of waste to landfill, 7% less than in 2020.
• Ford shared waste reduction best practices with nearly 80 key Tier 1 suppliers through PACE program.
• We increased FastPACE participation by over 60% from 2020, sharing Ford best practices in waste reduction with suppliers from China, India, 

Thailand, and South Africa.

• Ford is the largest automotive closed-loop aluminum recycler in the world. We worked closely with our aluminum sheet suppliers to create unique 
alloys just for closed-loop recycling. Our closed-loop system recovers aluminum scrap during parts stamping and saves 95% of the energy that 
would be required to create new aluminum from raw ore. This closed loop recycling system is used to build the F-Series, recovering up to 20 million 
pounds of high- strength, military-grade, aluminum alloy per month. Ford maximizes aluminum recycling in our plants and minimizes the need for 
primary metal. 

• Ford is continuing to drive the future of automotive 3D printing, this time teaming up with HP to innovatively recycle spent 3D printer powders and 

parts turning them into injection-molded vehicle parts – an industry first.

• Ford Bronco Sport Parts made from 100% Ocean-Harvested Plastic is an Industry First.

Sustainable Materials:
• Our LCA-based studies evaluate potential environmental implications of vehicle raw materials and manufacturing; for example, aluminum 

production and recycling, recycled polymers, cradle-to-gate impacts of lithium-ion batteries, environmental benefits of using second-life EV 
batteries, and additive manufacturing. 

• Renewable, plant-based materials also play a role in our sustainability strategy. Ford has launched over a dozen industry-first, plant-based materials 
in production vehicles since 2007, establishing a reputation as a leader in this space. These robust materials are often lighter in weight, improving 
fuel economy. They also sequester carbon during the plants growing phase, reducing global warming impacts, and they require less energy to 
manufacture. Ford first sustainable materials include soy foam, wheat straw, rice hulls, tree-based cellulose, coconut fiber, and coffee chaff. 

• Batteries are at the heart of our electrification strategy. We are collaborating with Redwood Materials to integrate battery recycling into our 

domestic battery strategy. Redwood’s recycling technology can recover, on average, more than 95% of strategic materials such as nickel, cobalt, 
lithium and copper. These materials can be recycled in a closed-loop with Redwood moving to produce anode copper foil and cathode active 
materials for future battery production. Using locally produced, recycled battery materials, will help ensure valuable materials in products re-enter 
the supply chain, reducing our reliance on the existing commodities supply chain that will be quickly overwhelmed by industry demand. 

• Our packaging guidelines for North America and Asia Pacific require our suppliers’ packaging to have at least a neutral, if not positive, environmental 

footprint, achieved through the use of 100% recycled, renewable or recyclable materials.

• The team at the Dagenham Engine Plant in the U.K. have been honored for creating the Frame Tray system, injection-molded trays and lids that can 

be endlessly recycled, saving millions of dollars and 50% increase in packing density.

• We also work to minimize substances of concern in our products and facilities. We have developed a list of targeted chemicals compiled from 
international, authoritative sources and engage suppliers to reduce these substances through process efficiencies, product replacements or 
reformulation. 

• To help our suppliers source materials ethically and responsibly, we use enhanced requirements in contracts, reporting requests and transparent 
dialogue. We’ve extended our responsible sourcing requirements beyond conflict minerals. We monitor our supply chains to ensure our materials 
are safe and responsibly sourced.

• In January 2021, we joined the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), a global group that promotes ecologically and socially responsible 

mining in large-scale operations. We also joined the Copper Mark’s Advisory Council in early 2021.

More Information

Climate change is a global challenge that affects us all, so we are 
strengthening our commitment to the Paris Agreement through 
our aspiration to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Emissions 
from our operations and the use of our vehicles contribute to 
climate change, negatively impacting people and communities.

Carbon Neutrality:
• Our commitment to carbon neutrality by no later than 2050 is at the heart of our climate change strategy. We are the only full-line U.S. automaker 

committed to reducing CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement and working with California for stronger greenhouse gas emission standards. 

• At the COP26, the UN Climate Summit in November 2021, we signed the RouteZero pledge committing to rapidly accelerating the transition to zero 
emission vehicles to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and working towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 
2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets.

reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2035 from a 2017 base year, and a 50% reduction in Scope 3 GHG emission per vehicle kilometer from 
use of sold products by 2035 from a 2019 base year.

• We’re investing $50 billion in electric vehicles and battery production from 2022 through 2026.
• By 2026 we will grow to an annual production of more than 2 million EVs.
• Expect EVs to represent 50% of global sales volume by 2030.
• Ford and SK Innovation to invest $11.4 billion and create nearly 11,000 new jobs in Tennessee and Kentucky with production of the electric vehicles 

and lithium-ion batteries in 2025, creating our first greenfield carbon neutral facilities.

• In November 2021, we announced a $2.5 billion green bond to help us achieve our carbon neutrality goal. Proceeds from the bond sales are aimed 

at initiatives to benefit the environment, including designing developing and manufacturing zero-emissions transportation solutions.

• Improved energy efficiency and conservation in our facilities and manufacturing processes have resulted in a 35% reduction in our GHG footprint 

since 2017.

• Global amount of renewable electricity for 2021 was 32.4%.
• Joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Climate Challenge to reduce GHG emissions from our facilities by at least half by 2030.
• The We Are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment policy commits Ford to drive human progress by enhancing the health 

and well-being of the communities that surround us, respecting the rights of the people who live there and protecting the environment.

• Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our requirements for supplier relationships in areas related to human rights, the environment, responsible 

material sourcing, responsible and lawful business practices and the associated implementation of these principles.

Climate Reporting:
• We are committed to transparently reporting our climate change strategies and their resilience. We have received the 2020 CDP ratings and received 

A ratings for both Water and Climate (our 3rd year in a row as “A” for climate and 7th for water). 

• We have issued climate change scenario reports since 2020. This year we have produced our first consolidated report that combines our Climate 

Change Scenario Report and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index.

• Shared GHG emission reduction best practices with nearly 80 key Tier 1 suppliers through PACE.
• FastPACE suppliers, a streamlined version of our PACE supply chain sustainability program, key partners in China, India, Thailand and South Africa 

are on track to save an estimated 4,909 metric tons of CO2 over the next three years.

Ford included all elements of compensation in its calculation of this ratio. Ratios reported for 2020 and earlier GEI were derived 
solely from base pay. Year-over-year trends prior to 2021 cannot be judged by comparing this ratio to responses from prior 
surveys. Ford’s 2022 Global Salaried Gender Pay Ratio, which represents the weighted average ratio of mean female and male 
salaries within peer groups** worldwide, was 98.0%. While ratios provide a rough measure of pay equity, they do not account 
for individual circumstances. Although our analyses show no indications of systemic pay bias, we will continually monitor our 
entire compensation structure to ensure that all employees are paid appropriately.

**A peer group consists of employees in the same region, salary grade and skill team, when available.

The gender pay gap, as defined by Bloomberg, is the raw difference between average male and female pay levels, disregarding 
any differences such as experience, education, skills, or job role. All of these factors affect the pay level that is appropriate for 
any employee, regardless of gender. Our commitment, therefore, is to identify and close any gaps that may exist taking into 
account all of these factors, which is not tied to the gender pay gap as Bloomberg defines it. We are committed to equal pay 
for equal work. Employee compensation in each market should be fair and equitable, irrespective of gender, race, or similar 
personal characteristics.

New Parent Ramp-Up is an experimental program in the US designed to help new parents adjust to balancing work and family 
obligations. Under this program, employees with new children (via birth, adoption or foster care) may work a 60%–80% reduced 
schedule for four weeks (typically the first four weeks following return from leave of absence, if one was taken) at full pay.

All facilities provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and is free from intrusion from coworkers and 
the public for employees to express breast milk. This functional space has, at a minimum, a place for the nursing mother to sit, 
a table on which to place the pump and an electrical outlet.

In addition, storage/shipment of expressed milk is considered a reasonable business expense which can be charged to the 
nursing mother’s corporate credit card while traveling on Company business.

Participation in diversity programs, including unconscious bias training, is integrated into the continuous learning and 
development of managers and employees and throughout organizational objectives without being mandated.

Starting in 2021, as part of our commitment to accelerating our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, every corporate 
officer will have an individual DEI performance objective and in 2022 this was expanded to all salaried employees globally 
(see Integrated Sustainability and Financial Report 2022 > Human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion, page 55 for 
further information). Performance against personal objectives influences overall performance ratings, which determine 
individual payouts under our annual cash incentive plan. 

See We are Committed to Protecting Human Rights and the Environment Policy

Ford delivered mandatory anti-harassment training for all global employees in 2020. Sexual harassment training is mandatory
