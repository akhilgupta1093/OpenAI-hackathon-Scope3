OUR GLOBAL PURPOSE-LED PERFORM ANCE APPR OACH

Michael Okoroafor, Chief Sustainability Officer

Michael Okoroafor is McCormick’s first Chief Sustainability Officer, whose key goal is to 
drive McCormick forward as a leader in sustainability. Working throughout the enterprise, 
he will develop and execute the Company’s sustainability strategy internally and externally, 
as he partners with McCormick’s Purpose-led Performance Governing Council, as well as 
our commercial and communications teams to ensure continuous promotion of our PLP 
initiatives. As a leader in the sustainability space, he was recognized as a 2020 honoree 
for the Environment + Energy Leader (E+E) 100.

Michael has referred to McCormick’s PLP work as a “journey” and often draws upon 
his upbringing in a farming community in Nigeria, which first spurred his interest in 
sustainability: “When I was growing up, I saw how hard my mother, a subsistence farmer, 
worked and I saw what it took for her to really make enough money to support her four 
children after my dad passed away. For me, it was the formative years of my life that really 
had an impact, and that experience continues to benefit me today, especially in how I 
approach things and my view of sustainability.”

For Michael, sustainability “is really a way of doing the right thing, whether you’re talking 

about our people, our farming communities or the planet we share.”

Materiality Assessment

McCormick ESG Materiality Matrix

As the basis of this report, we’ve conducted an updated materiality assessment to reflect the utmost 

relevant environmental, social and governance reporting for our stakeholders. As in years past, our 

materiality assessment has driven forward our approach to sustainability and allows us to prioritize topics 

most important to our business and external stakeholders, including customers, consumers, employees, 

communities and shareholders.

Our 2021 materiality assessment engaged a wide variety of external stakeholders, and a number 

of employees, such as operation leads across teams, including but not limited to, packaging 

innovation, supply chain, consumer strategy, agriculture and financial planning and analysis, as 

well as members from our PLP Leadership Team and Governing Council, and senior management. 

External stakeholder engagement included interviews and surveys of IGOs, NGOs and trade bodies as 

well as investors, industry analysts, customers and suppliers. As part of the external engagement, we 

surveyed over 1,000 consumers.

The materiality assessment sourced topics and their relevancy from stakeholder engagement including 

surveys and interviews, and leading third-party ESG frameworks, standard-setters, rating agencies and 

providers. Specifically, as noted in our GRI index, we have aligned our materiality assessment with 

the Global Reporting Initiative. 

As demonstrated in our materiality assessment matrix and corresponding definitions chart at right, we 

have identified 24 material topics, which are stratified across three tiers of materiality. While we have 

tiered material topics, we recognize all areas are material and drive forward our success and strategy. 

However, the Strategic tier reflects topics where we can show leadership and differentiate ourselves, 

the Priority tier reflects priority material topics and the Material tier reflects generally material topics. 

Additionally, we have aligned our materiality matrix with our PLP reporting structure and 

designated topic categorization under People, Communities, Planet and Governance.

United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goal Alignment

No Poverty
In line with our Purpose-led Performance goals, we work in a variety of ways to improve 

the resilience and livelihoods of the farming communities that grow our key raw 

materials. This has included distributing personal protective equipment (PPE) during 

the COVID-19 pandemic and training farmers to improve agricultural practices in 

ways that will increase income. We also announced a partnership in August 2021 

with Citigroup, World Bank and IFC to provide suppliers with financial incentives 

linked to improvements in measures of social and environmental sustainability. 

The program has started with suppliers in Indonesia and Vietnam and will soon be 

launched in other countries. McCormick has a long legacy of supporting communities 

where we live, work and operate and, through numerous initiatives, including charitable 

donations, we’ve demonstrated our commitment to strengthening their wellbeing. 

Zero Hunger
As a global leader in flavor, we are uniquely positioned to aid in the effort to 

achieve zero hunger. Among our many commitments to farming communities, 

we are teaching farmers sustainable and effective growing techniques through 

our Grown for Good program, which supports farmer and community resilience. 
We aim to increase the resilience of 90% of smallholder farmers that grow 

our key iconic herbs and spices, as measured by increasing skills and capacity, 

income, access to financial services, education, nutrition and health. Additionally in 

2020, we donated more than $10 million across 22 countries to organizations 

addressing issues like healthcare access, racial injustice and food security, including 

more than $3 million to food banks, and in 2021, we donated over $8.2 million 

around the world.

Clean Water & Sanitation
We partner with third-party experts to identify opportunities 

to reduce our water use at targeted facilities around 

the world, helping achieve our goal of a 20% reduction in 

water use per ton of product produced from our facilities. 

McCormick is also working to facilitate access to safe 

drinking water for communities through various means 

such as investing in reverse osmosis water purification 

facilities in nine villages in India, benefiting an estimated 

30,000 individuals. McCormick also supports watershed 

improvement and drip irrigation implementation projects 

in India, saving up to 9,200 million liters of water annually.

Affordable & Clean Energy
McCormick is aggressively pursuing the use of clean energy

throughout its operations. In 2021, we joined the leading

global corporations committed to limiting climate warming to 

1.50C by 2030 and to achieving Net Zero by 2050. We’re also 

increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix 

through initiatives such as the development of our Peterborough Net 

Zero facility. We use 100% renewable electricity to power all three 

of our UK facilities and have contracts to do the same in Poland and 

Italy. Through projects with the Skipjack and Big Star solar facilities, 

we also use 100% renewable electricity to power our Maryland and

Climate Action
A core piece of our sustainability work is addressing climate change with 

numerous initiatives underway across our organization and raising our ambition 
with 1.50C-aligned targets by 2030 and Net Zero by 2050 in support of 

the UN Global Compact Action Platform which supports the race to zero. 

These efforts include partnering with humanitarian aid organizations to 

build resilience in climate-change-vulnerable farming communities and 

collaborating with peers like Mars and PepsiCo and our suppliers to reduce 

Scope 3 emissions. We know our actions alone cannot prevent climate 

change, but we work across our value chain, with suppliers, policy makers 

and other stakeholders to find ways to collaboratively develop new climate 

change solutions. We also have various climate change goals in place to 

support the UN SDGs, including a 25% reduction in carbon footprint from 

packaging and 100% circular plastics packaging.

Life on Land
Our Grown for Good sustainable sourcing standard embodies our commitment 
to protect, restore and promote the sustainable use of land. This standard 

is the first of its kind in the herbs and spices industry and illustrates our 

dedication to advancing accountability and performance in the sustainability 

space. Under Grown for Good we also take measures to reduce water 
use, improve soil health, avoid habitat degradation, and optimize 

energy efficiency where possible. We committed to ensuring all palm oil 

used within our supply chain would be sustainability sourced through 

the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) by 2025 and, in 2020, we 

achieved that goal.

Purpose-led Performance Goals

We’re excited to share the progress we’ve made toward our goals, which clearly demonstrates our continued focus on advancing sustainability. While we’re proud of our 

accomplishments, we recognize sustainability is a journey and there’s always work to be done. As such, we hold ourselves accountable to continuous improvement through a  

series of goals, organized by People, Communities and Planet pillars, to ensure an all-encompassing impact. 

We have a global database for all our PLP goals, which expands our ability to review project status by region, priority and start and end dates. The database also helps us create global 

and regional dashboard reports, which track project priorities, status, complexity and monthly progress, in addition to a Roadmap Report, which identifies annual targets toward our goals, 

tracks progress and risks, and is used by our PLP Governing Council in global decision-making. 

We have provided progress updates on all goals in the table that follows, but first wish to highlight several notable developments:

Notable Developments

C O M M I T M E N T

First, we have surpassed our goal of a 50% increase in the number of McCormick Science Institute citations in professional literature, four years ahead of schedule.

While we have achieved our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 goal four years early, we are also elevating our greenhouse gas emissions targets from 2°C to 1.5°C. With the submission of our 1.50C target, we will join the UN 

Science-Based Targets initiatives Business Ambition for 1.5°C, a global, cross-sector coalition of companies that have acknowledged the critical importance of limiting the impacts of climate change. The elevated 

goal also represents our commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050.

To reflect our increased ambition to reduce water use and increase our recycling and recovery of solid waste across our facilities, we have introduced new goals to reduce water use by 25% and to recycle or 

recover 85% of solid waste throughout our operations by 2030.

We are also revising our product transparency goal to better align with sustainability standards. Our newly stated goal is: 90% of our sales are from products that enable health, nutrition or natural consumer 

choices. Our response will provide a detailed breakdown by additives, fat, saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterol, beneficial nutrients, relative claims, containing GMOs and containing non-GMO. Previously the goal 

had been 90% of products with improved transparency (non-GMO, BPA-free, Organic).

Finally, we are introducing McCormick’s new global Power of Giving umbrella brand to help us tell the full story about how McCormick and our employees give back to communities. Through the Power of Giving, 

our corporate, regional and country-specific initiatives come together under one unified global program to inspire and engage employees to support the causes they care about through matching gifts, volunteer time 

off and community service. We now aim to have 80% of our employees globally participate in our Power of Giving program globally instead of the singular Charity Day event.

Third-Party Monitoring 
& Risk Management

We utilize an automated third-party risk-based management program, called RiskRate, 

which drives strong efficiency and efficacy when mitigating the risk of transactions with 

third parties through identifying red-flags and other risk factors. When applicable, we 

may drive forward further risk-based assessments as deemed appropriate. RiskRate 

and our broad third-party risk management efforts ensure we are evaluating the extent 

to which our partners act ethically, conduct business in compliance with applicable laws 

and regulations and embrace our Company’s values. RiskRate is a cross-functional effort, 

including support from our Legal, Internal Audit and Ethics and Compliance departments.

Political Activity Policy

McCormick believes it’s important to educate policymakers and participate in public 

dialogue around issues to which we can positively contribute, but is careful to maintain 

our independence, as evidenced in our policies. We do not contribute to political action 

committees (PACs), political campaign committees, whether candidate-controlled or 

independent, or ballot initiatives. Employees at all levels must comply with applicable laws 

and internal policies.

GROWN FOR GOOD FRAMEWORK: THE SUSTAINABLE TASTE O F M cCOR MICK

McCormick is leading 
its own sustainability journey

To deliver our vision of holistic development, we refined our interpretation of sustainability, strengthening what’s most 

important to McCormick. The result, Grown for Good, stands for a vision in which the lives and livelihoods of farmers 
and farming communities are not just protected but enhanced. It is a system that conserves and enriches the local and 

global environment and builds resiliency at every stage of the supply chain.

The Grown for Good framework was launched in the 2019 Purpose-led Performance Report and outlines our theory of 
change to drive impact through sustainable sourcing. Unlike other sustainability programs that are generally focused on 

a single tier in the supply chain (either farm or supplier facility), Grown for Good delivers impact across the entire supply 
chain, embedding the current processes and procedures around supplier responsibility and ethics into the model, as 

well as compliance to a third-party audited standard, while aligning with our PLP commitments.

GROWN FOR GOOD FRAMEWORK: THE SUSTAINABLE TASTE OF Mc COR MICK

Setting the rules with our own 
sustainability standard

An essential component to underpinning the framework was the creation of 

McCormick’s own, industry-leading sustainability standard, specifically tailored for 

herbs and spices. We partnered with Peterson Control Union, experts in customized

certification programs, whose experience included working with other large

corporations on their sustainability journeys.

The creation of the Grown for Good standard took approximately one year from 
engagement to piloting the program. McCormick built upon our combined knowledge 

of the sector and related sustainability challenges, while capitalizing on strategic 

partnerships with suppliers at origin. The Grown for Good toolkit includes a step-by-step 
Implementation Guide and adapted surveys to gather data for developing a greater 

understanding. One of the most significant benefits of the program is the focus on 

group-level compliance, which alleviates some of the burden from individual farmers 

in terms of documentation and management practices. It is also founded upon the 

philosophy of continuous improvement, with the flexibility of allowing low-risk, highly 

motivated suppliers to focus their efforts on impact-oriented programs. While critical 

compliance criteria focus on fair labor practices, both on farms and in factories, and on 

sustainable farming practices, it also includes continuous improvement criteria focused 

on contributing to farmer resilience and women’s economic empowerment.

The top five iconics 
are just the beginning

The toolkit developed for herbs and spices provides step-by-step guides for 

implementers and auditors, enabling the Grown for Good standard to be 
replicated in any agricultural supply chain in McCormick’s portfolio, with the 

possibility of being extended to the wider industry. Our strategic partnerships 

will also facilitate the in-country training of trainers and auditors to ensure that 

standard implementation is efficient and independently verified.

with this in mind, we underwent the process of benchmarking the Grown for Good standard 
against other leading industry standards, achieving the equivalent of FSA Silver-level in 2021. This 

benchmarking was completed independently by the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform and 

is therefore recognized across the food and beverage industry, allowing our customers to make

While the standard focuses on farming practices and supply chain compliance, the Grown for Good

from, encompassing people, communities and planet, to ensure supply continuity as well as long-

Employee Development  
Programs

Through our long-standing commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion as well as our partnership with 

Korn Ferry, an industry-leading organizational consultant, we continue investing in the Global Women’s 

Ignite Program, an initiative geared toward helping female talent advance within the Company. This is 

an investment in the long-term success of these women, and long-term growth for our business. Even 

during the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick adapted the program to a virtual classroom environment to 

ensure its continuation.

        It has been great to connect with so many global colleagues.  

It has been eye-opening for me to see that although we physically sit 

The program, previously conducted over two, three-day, in-person sessions, was converted to an all-

and experiences. It is great to be involved with so many like-minded

program, praising its highly organized structure and extended timeline. Completing the program gradually 

over nine months instead of a tightly scheduled week allowed participants to spend more time preparing 

women who are ambitious, driven and determined to succeed. If these

are the future leaders of McCormick, our future looks bright!  

— Molly Willcox

Participants said they hoped the program will continue to be offered in a virtual format in the future. As of 

2021, 100 women have graduated from the program.

Similarly, our U.S. Ignite Program, also in partnership with Korn Ferry for ethnically diverse talent, 

cultivates talent through a competitive nomination process that helps identify and partner participants 

with managers in an intense three-day curriculum designed to help manage headwinds in careers. As 

with Global Women’s Ignite, U.S. Ignite was reformatted during the pandemic, to an eight-month, eight-

session virtual experience. Participants have praised the opportunity to connect with colleagues and gain 

the tools to think through their career progression.

Since 2017, McCormick’s Journey to Excellence global supply chain operational excellence program has 

leveraged engagement surveys, leadership and development training, and skill toolsets to improve 

employees’ capabilities, both individually and as teams, to eliminate losses. Our Journey to Total

Employee Ownership program provides employees the equipment and processes to make decisions that 

impact their everyday work.

Listening to Employees and  
Recruiting Talent

Listening to Employees

McCormick recognizes the importance of retaining our people and, beyond our wide range of financial, physical 

and mental wellbeing benefits packages, McCormick actively listens to its employees in order to truly understand and 

address their needs. Therefore, just as we encourage our employees to continuously learn from each other, we are 

leading by example and learning from them. McCormick’s Global Supply Chain employees participate in quarterly 

pulse surveys that are tailored to the concerns of each location. Survey questions are locally driven and so, in turn, 

are any resulting actions. McCormick’s Pulse Survey Tool is designed to deliver fast, frequent and measurable 

insight into the health of a site.

These pulse surveys yield several key benefits, including:

• Near real-time measurement of employee engagement and satisfaction
• An accurate and comprehensive insight into employee attitude and engagement
• Allowance for analysis of improvements over time
• Direction for future employee engagement activities
• Frequent reminder that our leaders value employee feedback
• Promotion of culture of continuous improvement

Most importantly, our employees feel listened to and are encouraged to engage in open communication. As part 

of our continuous listening efforts, in 2021, McCormick launched its first DE&I survey to ensure we are looking at 

diversity, equity and inclusion factors that may be on the minds of our employees.

We also leverage VIBE, our annual engagement survey, as part of our overall Continuous Listening Strategy. 

Launched in 2019 and expanded in 2020, the annual survey consists of 26 questions plus an open-ended response 

to measure engagement and enablement while generating new insights that fuel actions to drive improved results.

In 2020, we conducted three COVID-19 surveys to understand how employees were feeling and what they wanted 

As a result of their feedback, we prioritized actions around strengthening culture at McCormick with clear and regular

Recruiting New Employees

McCormick employs a number of recruiting strategies to attract diverse talent and remain a competitive and attractive 

employer. In 2021, 54% of new hires into professional level roles globally were female and, within the U.S., 

42% identified as Ethnically Diverse Talent. Annually, McCormick conducts a pay equity review to ensure that it 

remains competitive in the global marketplace. Project COMPETE is an example of how we’re working to create 

more competitive wage rates for our non-exempt employees. As part of this initiative, we’ve aligned our new hire pay 

rates to updated market data and have made salary adjustment recommendations to leadership to ensure existing 

employees are competitively aligned to the market. To date, we’ve also elevated manufacturing and distribution center 

wages by 12% to 15% in the U.S. and we continue to increase wages each year through our annual merit cycle. In 

our expansion efforts we’ve also built new plants, like the one we’ve recently unveiled in Peterborough, UK, and have 

accelerated our hiring to support our distribution center, hiring over 200 more employees in three months to ship and 

meet our record sales volume.

When it comes to recruitment, our DE&I Office has established key relationships with national 

professional associations including:

• Women in Manufacturing (“WiM”)

• Association of Latino Professionals for All (“ALPFA”)

• National Black MBA Association (“NBMBAA”)

• The National Organization on Disability (“NOD”)

These groups provide opportunities for further leadership development for the members of our Employee 

Ambassador Groups (“EAGs”) while also providing opportunities for our Company to post jobs and recruit from the 

national networks.

In 2019, McCormick’s Talent Acquisition and Talent Management Centers of Expertise partnered to develop and launch 

a new global employee brand and recruiting initiative called My McCormick, My Flavor, designed to proactively 

attract diverse early, mid-career and senior level talent. McCormick has since launched two sponsorship 

programs, one for the Americas region and another at the Corporate level, with the purpose of increasing more 

diverse candidates in our prospective employee talent pool. More than 30 people are participating in the program, 

with 16 participants in the corporate program and the rest in the Americas.

Our partnership with the NOD officially launches in Q1 2022 and includes a $40,000 commitment to increase 

the hiring of people with disabilities. The NBMBAA partnership was established in 2019 and has continued to 

grow as we attract ethnically diverse and Black talent for managerial and leadership roles.

OUR COMMITMENT TO  P EO PLE

Health & Safety

At McCormick, our first priority is our employees, and we are committed to their health and safety. We have a 

special responsibility to ensure our employees are protected and feel supported–particularly during the pandemic. 

The majority of our workforce continues to work on-site. To ensure these employees are protected while on the job, 

we have implemented a multitude of new initiatives as outlined in the COVID-19 section of this report.

Our belief is that an environment free of risks and hazards drives our forward-looking and mitigative approach to 

provide a safe workplace, which promotes the health of all employees as we look to drive real actions to attain our 

zero-injuries goal.

The health and safety of our employees and business partners is a pillar of our business  

success and we adhere to the following safety principles:

Occupational Health 
& Safety Management System

Looking forward, the Company is currently developing a world-class occupational health and safety management 

system that will standardize programs across the organization. The Occupational Health & Safety Management  

System section shares more information about the core pillars of the current program as well as those that are still 

in development.

OUR COMMITMENT TO  P EO PLE

System Overview

We are making strong progress in the development of our Occupational Health & Safety Management System 

and corresponding framework and standards. The systems and programs will be completed in the 2022 to 

2023 timeframe, with global implementation following shortly thereafter and all worksites will meet the 

expectations set within the system. Additionally, it will cover all McCormick employees and contractors that 

perform work at our sites. Highlights include:

•  Identifying hazards, assessing risk work-related injuries and ill health, and investigating incidents. We 
are developing a robust hazards, risks, and incidents program leveraging the foundation of our McCormick 
Incident Rate (MIR) system, which is our global system used to measure all medical and lost time incidents, 
including those that require more than just first aid. Our processes allow any employee to privately raise 
risks and hazard identifications through formal communication channels.

—  Further, we encourage all employees to stop work if they deem the situation hazardous. Currently, 

each site investigates any incidents internally, using root cause analysis, and we ensure any resulting 
corrective actions are managed to closure. The future system will further formalize incident 
investigation processes across the organization.

•  We currently manage employee health services, communication channels, training, promotion of employee 
Health, reduced exposure of chronic health risks, and mitigation of health & safety risks within our value 
chain.

—  We maintain these employee programs and services at the facility level and will formalize the processes 

across the organization upon launch of the new system.

COVID-19

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, McCormick established critical benefits and safety protocols to ensure the 

health and wellbeing of our employees. These efforts were investments in essential employees across our supply 

chain. We increased hourly wages, extended sick leave to support family members and maintained salaries globally 

even if operations were suspended. We also immediately implemented remote working practices and tools for our 

office teams. All efforts provided employees with support and the ability to effectively manage the pandemic for 

themselves and their families.

Investing in Our Employees

As an essential business, McCormick’s factory and distribution center locations have continued to operate during all 

stages of the pandemic. 

In addition to the premium pay for front-line workers, in the U.S., McCormick provided added flexibility for all 

employees to care for dependents, such as children unable to attend school or aging parents unable to access 

care facilities due to COVID-19. In the U.S., this included up to 5 days of 100% paid leave, followed by up to 11 

weeks at 2/3 pay, as well as support and flexibility through our new Caring Conversations initiative and benefit 

arrangements with care providers. Further, McCormick manufactured masks in China and sent them to the U.S. to 

be used as PPE. We hosted multiple vaccine clinics for employees and their families. As we emerge stronger from 

the pandemic, we know our success is a testament to the investments we’ve made in prioritizing the health and 

wellness of our employees. Notably, per a Pulse Survey, 76% of employees view the Company favorably and believe 

they have been supported during the pandemic.

Inclusion at McCormick

Part of our purpose-led mission centers around providing our people with the tools and resources they need to feel 

validated, supported and welcomed at McCormick. McCormick is committed to a diverse, equitable and inclusive 

culture, and building that culture in ways that bring tangible, positive outcomes for our employees and partners all 

over the world. Simply put, we are fostering diversity, equity and inclusion holistically throughout our business.

Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, the Black Employee Advisory Group (BEAG) partnered with the 

Global Diversity & Inclusion Council (GDIC) and the Global DE&I Center of Expertise to engage in a series of 

transparent conversations about potential improvements to internal systems, talent processes, and Company 

culture for all ethnically diverse employees. Among the twenty commitments developed as a result, this year we’ve 

also created specific goals regarding the hiring and advancement of talent at the Senior Leadership level (positions 

Grade 63 and above) by ethnicity and gender.

Nutrition & Health

Our Products

McCormick is committed to producing and distributing high-quality, nutritious products for use by our consumers 

across the world. Our continued innovation is driven forward by the McCormick Science Institute (“MSI”), which funds 

research partnerships with leading research institutions and universities across North America and Europe to study food 

science and human nutrition to enhance the understanding of potential health benefits of culinary herbs and spices.

A B O U T   T H E   Mc C O R M I C K   S C I E N C E   I N S T I T U T E :

Studies funded by the McCormick Science Institute regularly evaluate the health benefits of our herbs and spices. 

The Institute, an independent research-driven organization, supports scientific research and disseminates information 

on these health benefits to consumers, health professionals and other stakeholders. Led by nutrition scientists, the 

Institute’s work is guided by a Scientific Advisory Council consisting of internationally renowned scientists and health 

professionals from leading research institutions.

While MSI’s initial goal focused on gaining a basic understanding of herb and spice absorption, the Institute has now 

progressed to examine the metabolic effects of herbs and spices with relation to diabetes, pain and other ailments, in 

addition to learning more about diet quality for children, the military and elderly people.

An example MSI project is the exploration of the role of herbs and spices in the average American diet alongside four 

major universities–Penn State University, the University of Alabama, Illinois Institute of Technology and the University of 

California at Los Angeles–with the purpose of developing a greater understanding of the impact of herbs and spices on 

the health of the general population and the potential to reduce medical costs.

MSI is also working with Penn State University and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Extension Group, along with 

consumers and citizens, to improve diet quality through flavorful eating–teaching consumers that when used as a 

substitute for salt, sugar and fat flavorings, herbs and spices add flavor while making meals healthier.

Fulfilling our MSI citation goal speaks to our efforts to promote the health benefits of herbs and spices to reduce salt, 

sugar and fat intake to create healthy diets and better lives.

COVID-19 Relief Effort

McCormick has a long legacy of supporting the 

communities where we live, work and source. During 

the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, it became 

more important than ever to do our part to help 

provide for the critical needs of our communities.

As part of our global response to COVID-19, we 

committed $3 million to supporting food banks in 

the countries where we operate, as well as local 

restaurants and hospitality workers. We also called 

upon our communities and other organizations 

to join us in providing critical financial assistance. 

McCormick’s support for food banks continues 

following an initiative in 2019 which provided 1.3 

million meals for our 130th anniversary milestone.

OUR COMMITM ENT TO COMM UNITIES

In the U.S., we also teamed up with COREcares in 

partnership with OLD BAY and McCormick for Chefs 

businesses to establish the Maryland Restaurant 

Relief Fund, which provided grants to local restaurant 

operators, as well as the Hospitality Cares Pandemic 

Response Fund in partnership with its Zatarain’s 

and McCormick for Chefs brands to help support 

hospitality workers and restaurants in New Orleans.

Within the U.S. and internationally, McCormick made 

multiple product donations directly to hospitals and 

those providing meals to healthcare workers. And 

several of our U.S. and international business units 

provided financial and product donations to help 

local healthcare workers and start up organizations 

producing much-needed hand sanitizer.

we stood in support of Black employees to make a

In addition to signing the Ascend Compact with 

more than 100 other companies to address racial 

bias, we have made recent charitable donations and 

have honored the commitments we have made in 

the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion space. McCormick 

donated an additional $500,000 to employee-

injustice or provide critical food, healthcare or other 

essential services to Black communities impacted by 

police brutality.

The organizations selected were reviewed and 

approved by McCormick’s Black Advisory 

Group and Charitable Donations Committee 

and included over 30 organizations like  

countries and territories in EMEA. We supported 

19 partners in the region, including Show Racism 

The Red Card in the United Kingdom, Sport

Cohesion Collective in South Africa.

The organizations were nominated by McCormick 

EMEA employees, and approved by EMEA’s Employee 

advisory group, EmbRACE, which stands for 

“embrace race” and was formed to help advance 

diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the region.

Following its effort to support Black communities 

worldwide, McCormick supported causes working to 

address anti-Asian hate crimes as Asian-Americans 

faced increased violence against their communities. 

McCormick’s Asian Diversity Group (ADG) created

problematic multilayer plastics (13%), those typically used 

to make sachets, as the main barrier. Our intention is to 

replace this with a mono-polymer or fiber-based film that 

is recyclable by 2025. We will also remove the 3% multi-

component rigid packaging, which will then make all of 

our plastic packaging recyclable.

Supply Chain

McCormick ingredients are sourced from a variety of locations, including: Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mexico, Turkey, United 
States, and Vietnam. The most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products, pepper, vanilla, garlic, capsicums (red peppers and 
paprika), onion, rice and wheat flour. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw 
materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced locally, either within the United States or from our international locations. Because the raw 
materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, 
market conditions, and other factors beyond our control.

Significant Changes To The Organization And 
Its Supply Chain

• 
• 
• 

In 2017, McCormick strengthened its flavor leadership with addition of iconic products, including Frank’s RedHot® Hot Sauce & French’s® Mustard.
In 2020, McCormick completed the acquisition of Cholula Hot Sauce and acquired FONA International.
Each McCormick entity is tracked through a Global Tracker which maintains all Imports and Exports locations and is updated on a quarterly Basis. 

Precautionary Principle or Approach

Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market 
conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control.

102-12

External Initiatives

McCormick engages external stakeholders and develops partnerships with organizations around the world to improve the resilience of our farmers. 
McCormick has partnered with IFC, CARE, and WWF to conduct risk and opportunity assessments in key countries of origin and to inform the design 
of our Sustainable Sourcing framework. McCormick has partnered with USAID, USDA, GIZ and NCBA CLUSA to improve the resilience of around 
10,000 vanilla smallholder farmers in Madagascar and Indonesia. These initiatives aim to increase incomes while protecting biodiversity and improving 
governance through strong farmer cooperatives and Rainforest Alliance certification. McCormick has partnered with IDH (Sustainable Trade Initiative), 
IFC and USDA in Vietnam and Indonesia to improve the resilience of approximately 7,000 black pepper farmers. Initiatives include the training of 
farmers on good agricultural practices with the aim of becoming Rainforest Alliance CertifiedTM, the development of black pepper nurseries to increase 
production, and providing smallholder farmers with better access to international markets.

Infrastructure investments and services

Indirect Economic Impacts

203-2

Significant indirect economic impacts

McCormick supports infrastructure projects in the countries from which we source our top five iconic raw materials, based on identification through 
needs and risk assessments. Some examples include the construction of primary schools and a bridge to provide improved access for remote 
villages in Madagascar, the construction of clean drinking water facilities and a water catchment pond in India, and clean drinking water and waste 
disposal infrastructure as well as a community center in Vietnam. We have also funded projects to improve existing facilities, including health centres 
in Indonesia. McCormick works with partners on the ground to ensure that local communities and authorities take ownership of the improved 
infrastructure, ensuring the long-term viability and upkeep of facilities.  
Communities positively benefit from these investments, as they often meet an immediate need previously identified. For example, in Madagascar, the 
construction of schools provides access to education, benefiting not only the children who attend, but also reducing the burden on women who bare the 
majority of the childcare duties when they are not in formalized education. Women therefore have more time for income-generating activities including 
vanilla farming and processing. The construction of a bridge also provided villagers with improved access to local markets. In India, community members 
were becoming ill from drinking water sourced locally, and therefore often trucked in clean water from nearby towns. The construction of reverse 
osmosis water filtering facilities provided clean water, locally, at a much lower cost, while preventing illness. This was particularly important during the 
COVID-19 pandemic when travel was restricted and trucks carrying water may have been prevented from traveling to these villages.
All of these investment are pro bono.

Investing in sourcing communities provides a number of economic benefits for McCormick. These investments increase farmer loyalty and build trust 
with our local sourcing partners, which results in less side-selling and improved quality of raw materials. In years in which yield is low due to weather or 
other external factors, our suppliers are more likely to have access to raw materials by having these direct relationships with farmers, ensuring continuity 
of supply for McCormick. These investments also reduce reputational risk for the company. For example, by investing in local schooling, we reduce the  
risk of child labor within our supply chains. 
McCormick has received multiple recognitions for our contributions to sustainability, including ranking 6th on the Global 100 most sustainable 
corporations in the world and the top rated food company on the Barron’s most sustainable companies. These recognitions provide indirect positive 
economic impacts for the company through earned media, which improves our brand value. Through our materiality assessment, we have identified that 
farmer and community resiliency, raw material sourcing and human rights are the most material issues for external stakeholders and therefore these 
investments play a    role in maintaining and attracting investors and customers and developing relationships with NGOs and funding partners such as 
USAID, GIZ and USDA.
